##### Abstract
Visual tracking is fragile in some difficult scenarios, for instance, appearance ambiguity and variation, occlusion can easily degrade most of visual trackers to some extent. In this paper, visual tracking is empowered with wireless positioning to achieve high accuracy while maintaining robustness. Fundamentally different from the previous works, this study does not involve any specific wireless positioning algorithms. Instead, we use the confidence region derived from the wireless positioning Cramer-Rao bound (CRB) as the search region of visual trackers. The proposed framework is low-cost and very simple to implement, yet readily leads to enhanced and robustified visual tracking performance in difficult scenarios as corroborated by our experimental results. Most importantly, it is utmost valuable for the practioners to pre-evaluate how effectively can the wireless resources available at hand alleviate the visual tracking pains.
