##### Abstract
This paper considers the problem of inferring image labels for which only a few labelled examples are available at training time. This setup is often referred to as low-shot learning in the literature, where a standard approach is to re-train the last few layers of a convolutional neural network learned on separate classes. We consider a semi-supervised setting in which we exploit a large collection of images to support label propagation. This is made possible by leveraging the recent advances on large-scale similarity graph construction. We show that despite its conceptual simplicity, scaling up label propagation to up hundred millions of images leads to state of the art accuracy in the low-shot learning regime.

本文考虑推断图像标签的问题，在训练时只有少数标签的例子可用。这种设置在文献中通常被称为低射程学习，其中标准方法是重新训练在不同类别上学习的卷积神经网络的最后几层。我们考虑一个半监督的设置，我们利用大量的图像来支持标签传播。这是通过利用最近在大规模相似图构建上的进步而实现的。我们表明，尽管其概念简单，将标签传播扩展到数以百万计的图像导致了低射击学习制度的最先进的准确性。
