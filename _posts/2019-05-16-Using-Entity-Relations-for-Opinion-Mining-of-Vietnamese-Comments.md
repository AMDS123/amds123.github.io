##### Abstract
In this paper, we propose several novel techniques to extract and mining opinions of Vietnamese reviews of customers about a number of products traded on e-commerce in Vietnam. The assessment is based on the emotional level of customers on a specific product such as mobile and laptop. We exploit the features of the products because they are much interested by customers and have many products in the Vietnam e-commerce market. Thence, it can be known the favorites and dislikes of customers about exploited products.
