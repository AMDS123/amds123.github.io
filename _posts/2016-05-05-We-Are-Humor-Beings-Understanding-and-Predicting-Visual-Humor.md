##### Abstract
Humor is an integral part of human lives. Despite being tremendously impactful, it is perhaps surprising that we do not have a detailed understanding of humor yet. As interactions between humans and AI systems increase, it is imperative that these systems are taught to understand subtleties of human expressions such as humor. In this work, we are interested in the question - what content in a scene causes it to be funny? As a first step towards understanding visual humor, we analyze the humor manifested in abstract scenes and design computational models for them. We collect two datasets of abstract scenes that facilitate the study of humor at both the scene-level and the object-level. We analyze the funny scenes and explore the different types of humor depicted in them via human studies. We model two tasks that we believe demonstrate an understanding of some aspects of visual humor. The tasks involve predicting the funniness of a scene and altering the funniness of a scene. We show that our models perform well quantitatively, and qualitatively through human studies. Our datasets are publicly available.

幽默是人生不可分割的一部分。尽管影响力很大，但我们对幽默的理解还不够深刻，这也许令人惊讶。随着人与人工智能系统之间的相互作用的增加，这些系统必须被教导去理解幽默等人类表达的微妙之处。在这项工作中，我们对这个问题感兴趣 - 场景中的哪些内容导致它变得有趣？作为理解视觉幽默的第一步，我们分析了抽象场景中表现的幽默，并为其设计计算模型。我们收集两个抽象场景的数据集，以便在场景级别和对象级别上进行幽默研究。我们分析这些有趣的场景，并通过人类研究来探索其中所描绘的不同类型的幽默。我们模拟两个任务，我们相信展示对视觉幽默的某些方面的理解。这些任务涉及预测场景的趣味性和改变场景的趣味性。我们表明，我们的模型表现良好的定量和定性通过人类研究。我们的数据集是公开的。
