##### Abstract
This paper proposes a new generalized two dimensional learning approach for particle swarm based feature selection. The core idea of the proposed approach is to include the information about the subset cardinality into the learning framework by extending the dimension of the velocity. The 2D-learning framework retains all the key features of the original PSO, despite the extra learning dimension. Most of the popular variants of PSO can easily be adapted into this 2D learning framework for feature selection problems. The efficacy of the proposed learning approach has been evaluated considering several benchmark data and two induction algorithms: Naive-Bayes and k-Nearest Neighbor. The results of the comparative investigation including the time-complexity analysis with GA, ACO and five other PSO variants illustrate that the proposed 2D learning approach gives feature subset with relatively smaller cardinality and better classification performance with shorter run times.

本文提出了一种新的基于粒子群特征选择的广义二维学习方法。所提出的方法的核心思想是通过扩展速度的维度将关于子集基数的信息包括到学习框架中。尽管有额外的学习维度，2D学习框架仍保留了原始PSO的所有关键功能。 PSO的大多数流行变体可以很容易地适应这个2D学习框架中的特征选择问题。考虑到几种基准数据和两种诱导算法：Naive-Bayes和k-Nearest Neighbor，评估了所提出的学习方法的功效。比较研究的结果，包括GA，ACO和其他五个PSO变体的时间复杂度分析表明，所提出的2D学习方法给出了具有相对较小的基数和更好的分类性能以及更短的运行时间的特征子集。
