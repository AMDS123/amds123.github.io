##### Abstract
This paper investigates the influence of discourse features on text complexity assessment. To do so, we created two data sets based on the Penn Discourse Treebank and the Simple English Wikipedia corpora and compared the influence of coherence, cohesion, surface, lexical and syntactic features to assess text complexity. Results show that with both data sets coherence features are more correlated to text complexity than the other types of features. In addition, feature selection revealed that with both data sets the top most discriminating feature is a coherence feature.

本文考察话语特征对文本复杂度评估的影响。为此，我们基于Penn Discourse Treebank和Simple English Wikipedia语料库创建了两个数据集，并比较了连贯性，内聚性，表面性，词汇和语法特征对评估文本复杂性的影响。结果显示，对于两个数据集，相关性特征与其他类型的特征相比，文本复杂性更为相关。另外，特征选择显示，对于两个数据集，最高分辨特征是一致性特征。
