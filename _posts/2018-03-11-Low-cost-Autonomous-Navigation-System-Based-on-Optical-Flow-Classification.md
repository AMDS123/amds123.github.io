##### Abstract
This work presents a low-cost robot, controlled by a Raspberry Pi, whose navigation system is based on vision. The strategy used consisted of identifying obstacles via optical flow pattern recognition. Its estimation was done using the Lucas-Kanade algorithm, which can be executed by the Raspberry Pi without harming its performance. Finally, an SVM-based classifier was used to identify patterns of this signal associated with obstacles movement. The developed system was evaluated considering its execution over an optical flow pattern dataset extracted from a real navigation environment. In the end, it was verified that the acquisition cost of the system was inferior to that presented by most of the cited works, while its performance was similar to theirs.

这项工作提供了一个低成本的机器人，由Raspberry Pi控制，其导航系统基于视觉。所采用的策略包括通过光流模式识别识别障碍物。它的估计是使用Lucas-Kanade算法完成的，该算法可以在不影响其性能的情况下由Raspberry Pi执行。最后，使用基于SVM的分类器来识别与障碍物移动相关的该信号的模式。考虑到在实际导航环境中提取的光流模式数据集的执行情况，对开发的系统进行了评估。最终证实，该系统的购置成本低于大多数引用作品的成本，而其性能与他们的相似。
