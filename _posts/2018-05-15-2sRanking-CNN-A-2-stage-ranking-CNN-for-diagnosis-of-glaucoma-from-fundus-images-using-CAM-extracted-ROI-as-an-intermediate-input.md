##### Abstract
Glaucoma is a disease in which the optic nerve is chronically damaged by the elevation of the intra-ocular pressure, resulting in visual field defect. Therefore, it is important to monitor and treat suspected patients before they are confirmed with glaucoma. In this paper, we propose a 2-stage ranking-CNN that classifies fundus images as normal, suspicious, and glaucoma. Furthermore, we propose a method of using the class activation map as a mask filter and combining it with the original fundus image as an intermediate input. Our results have improved the average accuracy by about 10% over the existing 3-class CNN and ranking-CNN, and especially improved the sensitivity of suspicious class by more than 20% over 3-class CNN. In addition, the extracted ROI was also found to overlap with the diagnostic criteria of the physician. The method we propose is expected to be efficiently applied to any medical data where there is a suspicious condition between normal and disease.

青光眼是视神经由于眼内压升高而受到长期损伤的疾病，导致视野缺陷。因此，在确诊青光眼之前监测和治疗疑似患者是很重要的。在本文中，我们提出了一个两阶段排名CNN，将眼底图像分类为正常，可疑和青光眼。此外，我们提出一种使用类激活图作为掩模过滤器并将其与原始眼底图像组合作为中间输入的方法。我们的结果比现有的3级CNN和排名CNN提高了10％左右的平均准确率，特别是将3级CNN的可疑级灵敏度提高了20％以上。此外，提取的ROI也被发现与医生的诊断标准重叠。我们建议的方法预计可有效应用于任何正常和疾病之间存在可疑病症的医疗数据。
