##### Abstract
The propagation of unreliable information is on the rise in many places around the world. This expansion is facilitated by the rapid spread of information and anonymity granted by the Internet. The spread of unreliable information is a wellstudied issue and it is associated with negative social impacts. In a previous work, we have identified significant differences in the structure of news articles from reliable and unreliable sources in the US media. Our goal in this work was to explore such differences in the Brazilian media. We found significant features in two data sets: one with Brazilian news in Portuguese and another one with US news in English. Our results show that features related to the writing style were prominent in both data sets and, despite the language difference, some features have a universal behavior, being significant to both US and Brazilian news articles. Finally, we combined both data sets and used the universal features to build a machine learning classifier to predict the source type of a news article as reliable or unreliable.

在全球许多地方，不可靠信息的传播正在增加。信息的快速传播和因特网授予的匿名促进了这种扩张。不可靠信息的传播是一个深入研究的问题，它与负面的社会影响有关。在之前的工作中，我们发现美国媒体报道的可靠和不可靠来源的新闻文章结构存在显着差异。我们在这项工作中的目标是探索巴西媒体的这种差异。我们在两个数据集中发现了重要的特征：一个与巴西新闻葡萄牙语，另一个与美国新闻英语。我们的研究结果表明，与两种数据集的写作风格相关的特征都很突出，尽管语言有差异，但某些特征具有普遍性，对美国和巴西的新闻报道都很重要。最后，我们结合了两个数据集，并使用通用特征来构建机器学习分类器，以预测新闻文章的来源类型是可靠还是不可靠。
