##### Abstract
We present the studies of magnetic properties of 2 MeV 4He+-irradiated GaN grown by metal-organic chemical-vapor deposition. Particle irradiation allowed controllable introduction of Ga-vacancy in the samples. The magnetic moments with concentrations changing between 4.3...8.3x10^17 cm^-3 showing superparamagnetic blocking at room temperature are observed. The appearance of clear hysteresis curve at T = 5 K with coercive field of about H_C = 270 Oe suggests that the formation of more complex Ga vacancy related defects is promoted with increasing Ga vacancy content. The small concentration of the observed magnetically-active defects with respect to the total Ga- vacancy concentration suggests that the presence of the oxygen/hydrogen-related vacancy complexes is the source of the observed magnetic moments.
