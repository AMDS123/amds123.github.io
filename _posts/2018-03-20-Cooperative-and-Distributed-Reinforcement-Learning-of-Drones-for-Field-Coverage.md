##### Abstract
This paper proposed a distributed Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) algorithm for a team of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) that can learn to cooperate to provide a full coverage of an unknown field of interest while minimizing the overlapping sections among their field of views. Two challenges in MARL for such a system are discussed in the paper: firstly, the complex dynamic of the joint-actions of the UAV team, that will be solved using game-theoretic correlated equilibrium, and secondly, the challenge in huge dimensional state space will be tackled with an efficient space-reduced representation of the value function table. We also provided our experimental results in details with both simulation and physical implementation to show that the UAVs can successfully learn to accomplish the task without the need of a mathematical model. This paper can serve as an efficient framework for using MARL to enable UAV team to work in an environment where its model is unavailable. In the future, we are interested in accounting for the stochastic aspect of the problem and technical aspects of a real-world deployment, where uncertainties, such as wind and other dynamics of the environment presents.

本文针对无人机（UAV）团队提出了一种分布式多智能体强化学习（MARL）算法，该算法可以学习合作以提供对未知感兴趣领域的全面覆盖，同时最大限度地减少视场之间的重叠部分。本文讨论了MARL中对这种系统的两个挑战：首先，无人机团队联合作战的复杂动态，将通过博弈论相关均衡来解决;其次，巨大维空间空间的挑战将用价值函数表的有效空间减少表示来解决。我们还通过模拟和物理实现的方式详细给出了我们的实验结果，以表明无人机可以成功地学习完成任务而不需要数学模型。本文可以作为使用MARL使无人机团队在其模型不可用的环境中工作的有效框架。未来，我们有兴趣考虑现实世界部署的问题和技术方面的随机方面，其中存在不确定性，例如风和其他环境动态。
