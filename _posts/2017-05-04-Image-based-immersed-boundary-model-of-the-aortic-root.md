##### Abstract
Each year, approximately 300,000 heart valve repair or replacement procedures are performed worldwide, including approximately 70,000 aortic valve replacement surgeries in the United States alone. This paper describes progress in constructing anatomically and physiologically realistic immersed boundary (IB) models of the dynamics of the aortic root and ascending aorta. This work builds on earlier IB models of fluid-structure interaction (FSI) in the aortic root, which previously achieved realistic hemodynamics over multiple cardiac cycles, but which also were limited to simplified aortic geometries and idealized descriptions of the biomechanics of the aortic valve cusps. By contrast, the model described herein uses an anatomical geometry reconstructed from patient-specific computed tomography angiography (CTA) data, and employs a description of the elasticity of the aortic valve leaflets based on a fiber-reinforced constitutive model fit to experimental tensile test data. Numerical tests show that the model is able to resolve the leaflet biomechanics in diastole and early systole at practical grid spacings. The model is also used to examine differences in the mechanics and fluid dynamics yielded by fresh valve leaflets and glutaraldehyde-fixed leaflets similar to those used in bioprosthetic heart valves. Although there are large differences in the leaflet deformations during diastole, the differences in the open configurations of the valve models are relatively small, and nearly identical hemodynamics are obtained in all cases considered.

全球每年都会进行大约300,000个心脏瓣膜修复或更换手术，仅在美国就包括约7万个主动脉瓣膜置换手术。本文描述了在构建主动脉根部和升主动脉动力学的解剖学和生理学现实沉浸式边界（IB）模型方面的进展。这项工作建立在先前主动脉根部的流体 - 结构相互作用（FSI）的早期IB模型之上，该模型以前在多个心动周期上实现了现实的血液动力学，但也限于简化的主动脉几何形状和主动脉瓣瓣尖生物力学的理想描述。相反，本文描述的模型使用从患者特异性计算机断层摄影血管造影（CTA）数据重建的解剖学几何形状，并且基于与实验拉伸测试数据拟合的纤维增强本构模型来描述主动脉瓣小叶的弹性。数值试验表明，该模型能够解决在实际网格间隔舒张和早期收缩的小叶生物力学。该模型还用于检查新鲜瓣叶和戊二醛固定的小叶所产生的力学和流体动力学的差异，类似于生物假体心脏瓣膜中使用的瓣叶。虽然舒张期小叶变形有很大差异，但瓣膜模型的开放构型差异相对较小，并且在所有情况下获得几乎相同的血液动力学。
