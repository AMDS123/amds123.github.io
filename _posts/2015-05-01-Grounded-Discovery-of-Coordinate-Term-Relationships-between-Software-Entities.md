##### Abstract
We present an approach for the detection of coordinate-term relationships between entities from the software domain, that refer to Java classes. Usually, relations are found by examining corpus statistics associated with text entities. In some technical domains, however, we have access to additional information about the real-world objects named by the entities, suggesting that coupling information about the "grounded" entities with corpus statistics might lead to improved methods for relation discovery. To this end, we develop a similarity measure for Java classes using distributional information about how they are used in software, which we combine with corpus statistics on the distribution of contexts in which the classes appear in text. Using our approach, cross-validation accuracy on this dataset can be improved dramatically, from around 60% to 88%. Human labeling results show that our classifier has an F1 score of 86% over the top 1000 predicted pairs.

我们提出了一种方法来检测软件领域的实体之间的协调关系，即Java类。通常，通过检查与文本实体关联的语料库统计来找到关系。然而，在一些技术领域，我们可以获得关于由实体命名的真实世界对象的附加信息，这表明使用语料库统计信息来耦合关于“基础”实体的信息可能导致改进的关系发现方法。为此，我们使用关于如何在软件中使用的分布信息来开发Java类的相似性度量，并将其与关于类在文本中出现的上下文的分布的语料库统计结合起来。使用我们的方法，该数据集的交叉验证准确度可以从大约60％提高到88％。人类标记结果显示，我们的分类器在前1000个预测对中具有86％的F1分数。
