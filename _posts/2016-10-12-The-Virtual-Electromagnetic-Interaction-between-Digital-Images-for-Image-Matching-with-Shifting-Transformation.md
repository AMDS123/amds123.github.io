##### Abstract
A novel way of matching two images with shifting transformation is studied. The approach is based on the presentation of the virtual edge current in images, and also the study of virtual electromagnetic interaction between two related images inspired by electromagnetism. The edge current in images is proposed as a discrete simulation of the physical current, which is based on the significant edge line extracted by Canny-like edge detection. Then the virtual interaction of the edge currents between related images is studied by imitating the electro-magnetic interaction between current-carrying wires. Based on the virtual interaction force between two related images, a novel method is presented and applied in image matching for shifting transformation. The preliminary experimental results indicate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

研究了两种图像匹配变换的新方法。该方法是基于图像中虚边缘电流的呈现，以及由电磁激发的两个相关图像之间的虚拟电磁相互作用的研究。图像中的边缘电流被提出为物理电流的离散模拟，其基于Canny类边缘检测提取的重要边缘线。然后通过模拟载流导线之间的电磁相互作用，研究相关图像之间边缘电流的虚拟相互作用。基于两幅相关图像之间的虚拟相互作用力，提出了一种新的图像匹配方法。初步实验结果表明了该方法的有效性。
