##### Abstract
Establishing dense correspondences between multiple images is a fundamental task in many applications. However, finding a reliable correspondence in multi-modal or multi-spectral images still remains unsolved due to their challenging photometric and geometric variations. In this paper, we propose a novel dense descriptor, called dense adaptive self-correlation (DASC), to estimate multi-modal and multi-spectral dense correspondences. Based on an observation that self-similarity existing within images is robust to imaging modality variations, we define the descriptor with a series of an adaptive self-correlation similarity measure between patches sampled by a randomized receptive field pooling, in which a sampling pattern is obtained using a discriminative learning. The computational redundancy of dense descriptors is dramatically reduced by applying fast edge-aware filtering. Furthermore, in order to address geometric variations including scale and rotation, we propose a geometry-invariant DASC (GI-DASC) descriptor that effectively leverages the DASC through a superpixel-based representation. For a quantitative evaluation of the GI-DASC, we build a novel multi-modal benchmark as varying photometric and geometric conditions. Experimental results demonstrate the outstanding performance of the DASC and GI-DASC in many cases of multi-modal and multi-spectral dense correspondences.

在多个图像之间建立密集的对应关系是许多应用程序的基本任务。然而，由于其具有挑战性的光度和几何变化，在多模式或多光谱图像中找到可靠的对应关系仍然没有解决。在本文中，我们提出了一个新的密集描述符，称为密集自适应自相关（DASC），以估计多模态和多光谱密集对应。基于图像中存在的自相似性对于成像模态变化的鲁棒性的观察，我们定义了描述符，其具有随机化的接受场池采样的一系列自适应自相关相似性量度，其中获得采样模式使用歧视性的学习。通过应用快速边缘感知滤波，密集描述符的计算冗余度大大降低。此外，为了解决几何变化，包括规模和旋转，我们提出了几何不变的DASC（GI-DASC）描述符，通过基于超像素的表示有效地利用DASC。为了对GI-DASC进行定量评估，我们建立了一种新颖的多模式基准，以改变光度和几何条件。实验结果表明，DASC和GI-DASC在许多多模态和多光谱密集对应的情况下表现出色。
