##### Abstract
In this paper, an efficient fragile blind quad watermarking scheme for image tamper detection and recovery based on lifting wavelet transform and genetic algorithm is proposed. TRLG generates four compact digests with super quality based on lifting wavelet transform and halftoning technique by distinguishing the types of image blocks. In other words, for each 2*2 non-overlap blocks, four chances for recovering destroyed blocks are considered. A special parameter estimation technique based on genetic algorithm is performed to improve and optimize the quality of digests and watermarked image. Furthermore, CCS map is used to determine the mapping block for embedding information, encrypting and confusing the embedded information. In order to improve the recovery rate, Mirror-aside and Partner-block are proposed. The experiments that have been conducted to evaluate the performance of TRLG proved the superiority in terms of quality of the watermarked and recovered image, tamper localization and security compared with state-of-the-art methods. The results indicate that the PSNR and SSIM of the watermarked image are about 46 dB and approximately one, respectively. Also, the mean of PSNR and SSIM of several recovered images which has been destroyed about 90% is reached to 24 dB and 0.86, respectively.

本文提出了一种基于提升小波变换和遗传算法的图像篡改检测与恢复的高效脆弱盲水印方案。 TRLG通过区分图像块的类型，基于提升小波变换和半色调技术生成四种超级质量的紧凑摘要。换句话说，对于每个2×2非重叠块，考虑恢复被破坏块的四次机会。采用基于遗传算法的特殊参数估计技术来提高和优化摘要和水印图像的质量。此外，使用CCS映射来确定用于嵌入信息的映射块，加密和混淆嵌入的信息。为了提高回收率，提出了Mirror-aside和Partner-block。与最先进的方法相比，用于评估TRLG性能的实验证明了水印和恢复图像质量的优越性，篡改定位和安全性。结果表明，水印图像的PSNR和SSIM分别约为46 dB和1。此外，已经被破坏约90％的几个恢复图像的PSNR和SSIM的平均值分别达到24dB和0.86。
