##### Abstract
Electronic health records (EHRs) stored in hospital information systems completely reflect the patients' diagnosis and treatment processes, which are essential to clinical data mining. Chinese word segmentation (CWS) is a fundamental and important task for Chinese natural language processing. Currently, most state-of-the-art CWS methods greatly depend on large-scale manually-annotated data, which is a very time-consuming and expensive work, specially for the annotation in medical field. In this paper, we present an active learning method for CWS in medical text. To effectively utilize complete segmentation history, a new scoring model in sampling strategy is proposed, which combines information entropy with neural network. Besides, to capture interactions between adjacent characters, K-means clustering features are additionally added in word segmenter. We experimentally evaluate our proposed CWS method in medical text, experimental results based on EHRs collected from the Shuguang Hospital Affiliated to Shanghai University of Traditional Chinese Medicine show that our proposed method outperforms other reference methods, which can effectively save the cost of manual annotation.
