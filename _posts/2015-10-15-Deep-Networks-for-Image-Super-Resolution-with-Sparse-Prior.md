##### Abstract
Deep learning techniques have been successfully applied in many areas of computer vision, including low-level image restoration problems. For image super-resolution, several models based on deep neural networks have been recently proposed and attained superior performance that overshadows all previous handcrafted models. The question then arises whether large-capacity and data-driven models have become the dominant solution to the ill-posed super-resolution problem. In this paper, we argue that domain expertise represented by the conventional sparse coding model is still valuable, and it can be combined with the key ingredients of deep learning to achieve further improved results. We show that a sparse coding model particularly designed for super-resolution can be incarnated as a neural network, and trained in a cascaded structure from end to end. The interpretation of the network based on sparse coding leads to much more efficient and effective training, as well as a reduced model size. Our model is evaluated on a wide range of images, and shows clear advantage over existing state-of-the-art methods in terms of both restoration accuracy and human subjective quality.

深度学习技术已被成功应用于计算机视觉的许多领域，包括低级图像恢复问题。对于图像超分辨率，最近已经提出了几种基于深度神经网络的模型，并且获得了超越所有以前手工模型的优越性能。接下来的问题是，大容量和数据驱动模型是否已成为不适当的超分辨率问题的主要解决方案。在本文中，我们认为以传统稀疏编码模型为代表的领域专业知识仍然是有价值的，它可以与深度学习的关键要素相结合，以取得进一步的改进结果。我们展示了一个专门为超分辨率设计的稀疏编码模型可以作为一个神经网络来体现，并且从头到尾训练成级联结构。基于稀疏编码的网络解释导致更高效和更有效的训练以及减小的模型大小。我们的模型在广泛的图像上进行评估，并且在恢复精度和人类主观质量方面比现有的最先进的方法显示出明显的优势。
