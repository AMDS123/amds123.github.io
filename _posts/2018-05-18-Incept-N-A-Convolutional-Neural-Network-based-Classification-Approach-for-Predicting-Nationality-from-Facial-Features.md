##### Abstract
The nationality of a human being is a well-known identifying characteristic used for every major authentication purpose in every country. Albeit advances in the application of Artificial Intelligence and Computer Vision in different aspects, its contribution to this specific security procedure is yet to be cultivated. With a goal to successfully applying computer vision techniques to predict the nationality of a person based on his facial features, we have proposed this novel method and have achieved an average of 93.6% accuracy with very low misclassification rate.

人的国籍是用于每个国家的每个重要认证目的的着名识别特征。尽管人工智能和计算机视觉在不同方面的应用取得了进展，但它对这一特定安全程序的贡献还有待培养。为了成功地应用计算机视觉技术来预测基于他的面部特征的人的国籍，我们已经提出了这种新颖的方法，并且已经实现了平均93.6％的准确度和非常低的错误分类率。
