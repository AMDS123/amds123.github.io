##### Abstract
Robots must reliably interact with refractive objects in many applications; however, refractive objects can cause many robotic vision algorithms to become unreliable or even fail, particularly feature-based matching applications, such as structure-from-motion. We propose a method to distinguish between refracted and Lambertian image features using a light field camera. Specifically, we propose to use textural cross-correlation to characterise apparent feature motion in a single light field, and compare this motion to its Lambertian equivalent based on 4D light field geometry. Our refracted feature distinguisher has a 34.3% higher rate of detection compared to state-of-the-art for light fields captured with large baselines relative to the refractive object. Our method also applies to light field cameras with much smaller baselines than previously considered, yielding up to 2 times better detection for 2D-refractive objects, such as a sphere, and up to 8 times better for 1D-refractive objects, such as a cylinder. For structure from motion, we demonstrate that rejecting refracted features using our distinguisher yields up to 42.4% lower reprojection error, and lower failure rate when the robot is approaching refractive objects. Our method lead to more robust robot vision in the presence of refractive objects.

机器人必须在许多应用中可靠地与折射物体相互作用;然而，折射对象会导致许多机器人视觉算法变得不可靠甚至失败，特别是基于特征的匹配应用，例如运动结构。我们提出了一种使用光场相机来区分折射和朗伯图像特征的方法。具体而言，我们建议使用纹理互相关来表征单个光场中的明显特征运动，并将该运动与基于4D光场几何的朗伯等效比较。我们的折射式特征识别器的检测率比用大型基线相对于折射物体捕获的最先进的光场高34.3％。我们的方法也适用于比以前考虑的基线小得多的光场相机，对2D-折射物体（如球体）的检测效果最高可提高2倍，对于1D-折射物体（例如圆柱体），检测效果最高提高8倍。对于来自运动的结构，我们证明，使用我们的识别器来抑制折射特征时，重投影误差降低了42.4％，并且机器人接近折射物体时的故障率更低。我们的方法在存在折射物体的情况下导致更强大的机器人视觉。
