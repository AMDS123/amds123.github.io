##### Abstract
Recent approaches to human concept learning have successfully combined the power of symbolic, infinitely productive, rule systems and statistical learning. The aim of most of these studies is to reveal the underlying language structuring these representations and providing a general substrate for thought. Here, we ask about the plasticity of symbolic descriptive languages. We perform two concept learning experiments, that consistently demonstrate that humans can change very rapidly the repertoire of symbols they use to identify concepts, by compiling expressions which are frequently used into new symbols of the language. The pattern of concept learning times is accurately described by a Bayesian agent that rationally updates the probability of compiling a new expression according to how useful it has been to compress concepts so far. By portraying the Language of Thought as a flexible system of rules, we also highlight the intrinsic difficulties to pin it down empirically.

最近的人类概念学习方法已经成功地结合了符号，无限生产力，规则系统和统计学习的力量。这些研究大部分的目的是揭示构成这些表征的基础语言，并为思考提供一个通用基础。在这里，我们询问符号描述语言的可塑性。我们执行两个概念学习实验，一致证明人类可以非常迅速地改变他们用来识别概念的符号库，方法是将经常使用的表达式编译成新的语言符号。概念学习时间的模式由贝叶斯智能体准确地描述，该智能体合理地更新编译新表达式的可能性，根据迄今为止压缩概念的有用程度。通过将思想语言描绘成一个灵活的规则体系，我们还强调了根据经验确定的内在困难。
