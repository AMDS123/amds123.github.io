##### Abstract
Mutation is one of the most important stages of the genetic algorithm because of its impact on the exploration of global optima, and to overcome premature convergence. There are many types of mutation, and the problem lies in selection of the appropriate type, where the decision becomes more difficult and needs more trial and error. This paper investigates the use of more than one mutation operator to enhance the performance of genetic algorithms. Novel mutation operators are proposed, in addition to two selection strategies for the mutation operators, one of which is based on selecting the best mutation operator and the other randomly selects any operator. Several experiments on some Travelling Salesman Problems (TSP) were conducted to evaluate the proposed methods, and these were compared to the well-known exchange mutation and rearrangement mutation. The results show the importance of some of the proposed methods, in addition to the significant enhancement of the genetic algorithm's performance, particularly when using more than one mutation operator.

##### Abstract (translated by Google)
突变是遗传算法最重要的阶段之一，因为它对全局最优解的影响，克服了早熟收敛。突变的种类很多，问题在于选择适当的类型，决策变得更加困难，需要更多的尝试和错误。本文研究了使用多个变异算子来提高遗传算法的性能。提出了新的变异算子，除变异算子的两种选择策略外，其中一种选择最佳变异算子，另一种随机选择任意算子。对一些旅行商问题（TSP）进行了几个实验来评估所提出的方法，并将其与着名的交换突变和重排突变进行比较。结果显示了一些提出的方法的重要性，除了显着增强遗传算法的性能外，特别是当使用多于一个变异算子时。
