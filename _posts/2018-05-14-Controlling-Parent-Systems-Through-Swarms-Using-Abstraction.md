##### Abstract
This study considers the control of parent-child systems where a parent system is acted on by a set of child systems (i.e. a swarm) with their own inputs. Examples of such systems include a swarm of robots pushing an object over a surface, a swarm of aerial vehicles carrying a large load, or a set of end effectors manipulating an object. In this paper, a general approach for decoupling the swarm from the parent system through a low-dimensional abstract state space is presented. The requirements of this approach are given along with how constraints on both systems propagate through the abstract state and impact the requirements of the controllers for both systems. To demonstrate, several controllers with hard state constraints are designed to track a given desired angle trajectory of a tilting plane with a swarm of robots driving on top. Both homogeneous and heterogeneous swarms of varying sizes and properties are considered to test the robustness of this architecture. The controllers are shown to be locally asymptotically stable and are demonstrated in simulation.

本研究考虑了在父母系统由一组具有自己的输入的子系统（即群）执行的情况下控制父母 - 子系​​统。这种系统的例子包括一群机器人将一个物体推过一个表面，一群载有大量负载的飞行器或一组末端执行器操纵一个物体。在本文中，介绍了一种通过低维抽象状态空间将群与父系统解耦的通用方法。这种方法的要求与两个系统的约束如何通过抽象状态传播并影响两个系统的控制器要求一起给出。为了演示，具有硬状态约束的若干控制器被设计为跟踪倾斜平面的给定期望角度轨迹，其中一群机器人在顶部行驶。认为具有不同尺寸和性质的均匀和异构群体被认为是测试这种架构的稳健性。控制器显示为局部渐近稳定，并在仿真中进行演示。
