##### Abstract
Image captioning has attracted considerable attention in recent years. However, little work has been done for game image captioning which has some unique characteristics and requirements. In this work we propose a novel game image captioning model which integrates bottom-up attention with a new multi-level residual top-down attention mechanism. Firstly, a lower-level residual top-down attention network is added to the Faster R-CNN based bottom-up attention network to address the problem that the latter may lose important spatial information when extracting regional features. Secondly, an upper-level residual top-down attention network is implemented in the caption generation network to better fuse the extracted regional features for subsequent caption prediction. We create two game datasets to evaluate the proposed model. Extensive experiments show that our proposed model outperforms existing baseline models.
