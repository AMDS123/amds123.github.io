##### Abstract
This paper presents a problem of model learning to navigate a ball to a goal state in a circular maze environment with two degrees of freedom. Motion of the ball in the maze environment is influenced by several non-linear effects such as friction and contacts, which are difficult to model. We propose a hybrid model to estimate the dynamics of the ball in the maze based on Gaussian Process Regression equipped with basis functions obtained from physic first principles. The accuracy of the hybrid model is compared with standard algorithms for model learning to highlight its efficacy. The learned model is then used to design trajectories for the ball using a trajectory optimization algorithm. We also hope that the system presented in the paper can be used as a benchmark problem for reinforcement and robot learning for its interesting and challenging dynamics and its ease of reproducibility.

##### Abstract (translated by Google)
本文提出了一个模型学习问题，即在具有两个自由度的圆形迷宫环境中将球导航到目标状态。球在迷宫环境中的运动受到若干非线性效应的影响，例如摩擦和接触，这些非线性效应难以建模。我们提出了一种混合模型来估计基于高斯过程回归的迷宫中球的动态，该高斯过程回归配备有从物理第一原理获得的基函数。将混合模型的准确性与模型学习的标准算法进行比较，以突出其功效。然后，使用轨迹优化算法将学习的模型用于设计球的轨迹。我们还希望本文提出的系统可以作为强化和机器人学习的基准问题，因为它有趣且具有挑战性，并且易于重现。
