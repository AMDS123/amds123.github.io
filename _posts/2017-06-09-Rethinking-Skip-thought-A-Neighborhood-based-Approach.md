##### Abstract
We study the skip-thought model with neighborhood information as weak supervision. More specifically, we propose a skip-thought neighbor model to consider the adjacent sentences as a neighborhood. We train our skip-thought neighbor model on a large corpus with continuous sentences, and then evaluate the trained model on 7 tasks, which include semantic relatedness, paraphrase detection, and classification benchmarks. Both quantitative comparison and qualitative investigation are conducted. We empirically show that, our skip-thought neighbor model performs as well as the skip-thought model on evaluation tasks. In addition, we found that, incorporating an autoencoder path in our model didn't aid our model to perform better, while it hurts the performance of the skip-thought model.

我们研究了邻里信息的跳跃思维模型作为弱监督。更具体地说，我们提出了一个跳过思想的邻居模型来考虑邻居句子作为一个邻居。在具有连续句子的大型语料库上训练我们的跳过思维邻居模型，然后对7个任务的训练模型进行评估，包括语义关联度，释义检测和分类基准。进行定量比较和定性调查。我们经验地表明，我们的跳过思想邻居模型和评估任务的跳跃思想模型一样好。另外，我们发现，在我们的模型中加入自动编码器路径并不能帮助我们的模型更好地执行，同时也会伤害跳过思考模型的性能。
