##### Abstract
We present a novel incremental learning approach for unsupervised word segmentation that combines features from probabilistic modeling and model selection. This includes super-additive penalties for addressing the cognitive burden imposed by long word formation, and new model selection criteria based on higher-order generative assumptions. Our approach is fully unsupervised; it relies on a small number of parameters that permits flexible modeling and a mechanism that automatically learns parameters from the data. Through experimentation, we show that this intricate design has led to top-tier performance in both phonemic and orthographic word segmentation.

##### Abstract (translated by Google)
我们提出了一种无监督分词的增量学习方法，它结合了概率建模和模型选择的特点。这包括解决由长单词形成带来的认知负担的超级加罚分，以及基于高阶生成假设的新模型选择标准。我们的方法是完全无人监督的;它依赖于少量的参数，允许灵活的建模和自动从数据中学习参数的机制。通过实验，我们发现这个复杂的设计已经导致了音位和正字分词的顶级性能。
