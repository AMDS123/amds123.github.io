##### Abstract
For crowded scenes, the accuracy of object-based computer vision methods declines when the images are low-resolution and objects have severe occlusions. Taking counting methods for example, almost all the recent state-of-the-art counting methods bypass explicit detection and adopt regression-based methods to directly count the objects of interest. Among regression-based methods, density map estimation, where the number of objects inside a subregion is the integral of the density map over that subregion, is especially promising because it preserves spatial information, which makes it useful for both counting and localization (detection and tracking). With the power of deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) the counting performance has improved steadily. The goal of this paper is to evaluate density maps generated by density estimation methods on a variety of crowd analysis tasks, including counting, detection, and tracking. Most existing CNN methods produce density maps with resolution that is smaller than the original images, due to the downsample strides in the convolution/pooling operations. To produce an original-resolution density map, we also evaluate a classical CNN that uses a sliding window regressor to predict the density for every pixel in the image. We also consider a fully convolutional (FCNN) adaptation, with skip connections from lower convolutional layers to compensate for loss in spatial information during upsampling. In our experiments, we found that the lower-resolution density maps sometimes have better counting performance. In contrast, the original-resolution density maps improved localization tasks, such as detection and tracking, compared to bilinear upsampling the lower-resolution density maps. Finally, we also propose several metrics for measuring the quality of a density map, and relate them to experiment results on counting and localization.

对于拥挤的场景，当图像分辨率低且对象严重遮挡时，基于对象的计算机视觉方法的准确性下降。以计数方法为例，几乎所有最新的计数方法都绕过显式检测，并采用回归方法直接计数感兴趣的对象。在基于回归的方法中，密度图估计（其中子区域内的对象的数量是该子区域上的密度图的积分）是特别有希望的，因为它保留了空间信息，这使得它对计数和定位（检测和定位跟踪）。随着深度卷积神经网络（CNNs）的计算性能稳步提高。本文的目标是评估密度估计方法在各种人群分析任务（包括计数，检测和跟踪）上生成的密度图。由于卷积/合并操作中的下采样步幅，大多数现有的CNN方法产生分辨率比原始图像小的密度图。为了产生原始分辨率密度图，我们还评估了使用滑动窗口回归器来预测图像中每个像素的密度的经典CNN。我们还考虑完全卷积（FCNN）自适应，从较低的卷积层跳过连接以补偿上采样期间空间信息的损失。在我们的实验中，我们发现较低分辨率的密度图有时具有更好的计数性能。相比之下，与双线性上采样较低分辨率密度图相比，原始分辨率密度图改善了定位任务，如检测和跟踪。最后，我们还提出了一些衡量密度图质量的指标，并将其与计算和定位的实验结果联系起来。
