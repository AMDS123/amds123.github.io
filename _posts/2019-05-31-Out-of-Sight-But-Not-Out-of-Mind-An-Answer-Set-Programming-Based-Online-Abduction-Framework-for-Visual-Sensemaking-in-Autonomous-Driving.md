##### Abstract
We demonstrate the need and potential of systematically integrated vision and semantics} solutions for visual sensemaking (in the backdrop of autonomous driving). A general method for online visual sensemaking using answer set programming is systematically formalised and fully implemented. The method integrates state of the art in (deep learning based) visual computing, and is developed as a modular framework usable within hybrid architectures for perception &amp; control. We evaluate and demo with community established benchmarks KITTIMOD and MOT. As use-case, we focus on the significance of human-centred visual sensemaking ---e.g., semantic representation and explainability, question-answering, commonsense interpolation--- in safety-critical autonomous driving situations.
