##### Abstract
The geometrical and performance scaling of silicon CMOS integrated circuit technology over the past 50 years has enabled many affordable new products for business and consumer applications. Recognizing that Flash is approaching its ultimate physical scaling limits within the next 10 years or so, the global electronics research community has begun an intense search for a new paradigm and technology for extending the functional scaling of memory technologies. Several promising nonvolatile memory concepts have emerged, based on different switching and retention mechanisms from those of Flash memory, e.g., STTRAM, RRAM, PCM and more recently, resistive memories based on carbon, which are the topic of this paper. This paper will introduce into the diverse field of carbon materials by recollecting some effects in carbon that can be used to produce a multiple time switchable, non-volatile unipolar resistive memory with potential high scalability down to atomic dimensions. Carbon-based memory is a non-volatile resistive memory, therefore, the same architectures, circuits, select transistor or diodes like in ReRAM or PCRAM can be considered as implementation. The big advantage of carbon memory might be the high temperature retention of 250 C, which makes it attractive for automotive and harsh conditions. This is a white paper for the ITRS meeting on emerging research devices (ERD) in Albuquerque, New Mexico, on August 25-26, 2014.
