##### Abstract
Deep learning algorithms and networks are vulnerable to perturbed inputs which are known as the adversarial attack. Many defense methodologies have been investigated to defend such adversarial attack. In this work, we propose a novel methodology to defend the existing powerful attack model. Such attack models have achieved record success against MNIST dataset to force it to miss-classify all of its inputs. Whereas Our proposed defense method robust pre-processing achieves the best accuracy among the current state of the art defenses. It consists of Tanh (hyperbolic tangent) function, smoothing and batch normalization to process the input data which will make it more robust over the adversarial attack. robust pre-processing improves the white box attack accuracy of MNIST from 94.3% to 98.7%. Even with increasing defense when others defenses completely fail, robust pre-processing remains one of the strongest ever reported. Another strength of our defense is that it eliminates the need for adversarial training as it can significantly increase the MNIST accuracy without adversarial training as well. This makes it a more generalized defense method with almost half training overhead and much-improved accuracy. robust pre-processing can also increase the inference accuracy in the face of the powerful attack on CIFAR-10 and SVHN data set as well without much sacrificing clean data accuracy.

深度学习算法和网络容易受到被称为敌对攻击的扰动输入的影响。为防御这种对抗性攻击，已经调查了许多防御方法。在这项工作中，我们提出了一种新的方法来捍卫现有的强大的攻击模式。这种攻击模式已经取得了创纪录的成功，对抗MNIST数据集，迫使它错过所有输入的分类。而我们提出的防御方法强大的预处理在当前最先进的防御中达到了最好的准确性。它由Tanh（双曲正切）函数，平滑和批量归一化来处理输入数据，这将使其在对抗性攻击方面更加稳健。鲁棒的预处理将MNIST的白盒攻击准确率从94.3％提高到98.7％。即使防御力增加，而其他防御措施完全失败，强大的预处理仍然是有史以来最强大的报告之一。我们防守的另一个优势在于消除了对抗性训练的需要，因为它可以显着提高MNIST的准确性而无需进行对抗训练。这使得它成为一个更广义的防御方法，几乎​​有一半的训练开销和更高的精度。鲁棒的预处理也可以提高面对CIFAR-10和SVHN数据集的强大攻击的推理精度，同时不会牺牲清晰的数据精度。
