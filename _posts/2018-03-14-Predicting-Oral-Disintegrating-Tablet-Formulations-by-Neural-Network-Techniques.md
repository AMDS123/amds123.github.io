##### Abstract
Oral Disintegrating Tablets (ODTs) is a novel dosage form that can be dissolved on the tongue within 3min or less especially for geriatric and pediatric patients. Current ODT formulation studies usually rely on the personal experience of pharmaceutical experts and trial-and-error in the laboratory, which is inefficient and time-consuming. The aim of current research was to establish the prediction model of ODT formulations with direct compression process by Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and Deep Neural Network (DNN) techniques. 145 formulation data were extracted from Web of Science. All data sets were divided into three parts: training set (105 data), validation set (20) and testing set (20). ANN and DNN were compared for the prediction of the disintegrating time. The accuracy of the ANN model has reached 85.60%, 80.00% and 75.00% on the training set, validation set and testing set respectively, whereas that of the DNN model was 85.60%, 85.00% and 80.00%, respectively. Compared with the ANN, DNN showed the better prediction for ODT formulations. It is the first time that deep neural network with the improved dataset selection algorithm is applied to formulation prediction on small data. The proposed predictive approach could evaluate the critical parameters about quality control of formulation, and guide research and process development. The implementation of this prediction model could effectively reduce drug product development timeline and material usage, and proactively facilitate the development of a robust drug product.

口腔崩解片（ODTs）是一种新型剂型，可以在3分钟或更短的时间内溶于舌头，特别适用于老年患者和儿科患者。目前的ODT制剂研究通常依赖于制药专家的个人经验以及实验室中的试验和错误，这是低效且耗时的。目前研究的目的是通过人工神经网络（ANN）和深度神经网络（DNN）技术建立直接压缩过程的ODT制剂预测模型。从Web of Science中提取145种制剂数据。所有数据集分为三部分：训练集（105数据），验证集（20）和测试集（20）。比较ANN和DNN以预测崩解时间。人工神经网络模型的准确率分别达到训练集，验证集和测试集的85.60％，80.00％和75.00％，而DNN模型的准确率分别为85.60％，85.00％和80.00％。与人工神经网络相比，DNN显示出更好的ODT制剂预测。这是第一次将改进后的数据集选择算法应用于小数据的公式化预测。所提出的预测方法可以评估制剂质量控制的关键参数，并指导研究和工艺开发。这种预测模型的实施可以有效地减少药品开发时间表和材料使用情况，并积极促进药物产品的开发。
