##### Abstract
An increasing number of computer vision tasks can be tackled with deep features, which are the intermediate outputs of a pre-trained Convolutional Neural Network. Despite the astonishing performance, deep features extracted from low-level neurons are still below satisfaction, arguably because they cannot access the spatial context contained in the higher layers. In this paper, we present InterActive, a novel algorithm which computes the activeness of neurons and network connections. Activeness is propagated through a neural network in a top-down manner, carrying high-level context and improving the descriptive power of low-level and mid-level neurons. Visualization indicates that neuron activeness can be interpreted as spatial-weighted neuron responses. We achieve state-of-the-art classification performance on a wide range of image datasets.

##### Abstract (translated by Google)
越来越多的计算机视觉任务可以用深度特征来解决，这些特征是预先训练的卷积神经网络的中间输出。尽管表现令人吃惊，从低级神经元提取的深度特征仍然低于满意度，可以说是因为它们不能访问包含在较高层中的空间上下文。在本文中，我们介绍了一种计算神经元和网络连接活性的新型算法InterActive。主动性通过神经网络以自上而下的方式传播，承载高层次的语境，提高低层和中层神经元的描述能力。可视化表明，神经元活性可以解释为空间加权的神经元反应。我们在广泛的图像数据集上实现了最先进的分类性能。
