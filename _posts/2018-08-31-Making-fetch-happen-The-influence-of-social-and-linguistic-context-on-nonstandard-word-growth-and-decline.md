##### Abstract
In an online community, new words come and go: today's "haha" may be replaced by tomorrow's "lol." Changes in online writing are usually studied as a social process, with innovations diffusing through a network of individuals in a speech community. But unlike other types of innovation, language change is shaped and constrained by the system in which it takes part. To investigate the links between social and structural factors in language change, we undertake a large-scale analysis of nonstandard word growth in the online community Reddit. We find that dissemination across many linguistic contexts is a sign of growth: words that appear in more linguistic contexts grow faster and survive longer. We also find that social dissemination likely plays a less important role in explaining word growth and decline than previously hypothesized.

在一个在线社区，新词来来去去：今天的“哈哈”可能被明天的“哈哈”所取代。在线写作的变化通常被视为一个社会过程，创新通过语言社区中的个人网络传播。但与其他类型的创新不同，语言变化受其所参与的系统的影响和约束。为了研究语言变化中社会和结构因素之间的联系，我们对在线社区Reddit中的非标准词增长进行了大规模分析。我们发现跨越许多语言环境的传播是增长的标志：出现在更多语言环境中的词语变得更快，存活时间更长。我们还发现，社会传播在解释单词增长和下降方面可能不如之前假设的那么重要。
