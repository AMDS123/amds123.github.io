##### Abstract
Breast cancer is one of the most common and prevalent type of cancer that mainly affects the women population. chances of effective treatment increases with early diagnosis. Mammography is considered one of the effective and proven techniques for early diagnosis of breast cancer. Tissues around masses look identical in mammogram, which makes automatic detection process a very challenging task. They are indistinguishable from the surrounding parenchyma. In this paper, we present an efficient and automated approach to segment masses in mammograms. The proposed method uses hierarchical clustering to isolate the salient area, and then features are extracted to reject false detection. We applied our method on two popular publicly available datasets (mini-MIAS and DDSM). A total of 56 images from mini-mias database, and 76 images from DDSM were randomly selected. Results are explained in-terms of ROC (Receiver Operating Characteristics) curves and compared with the other techniques. Experimental results demonstrate the efficiency and advantages of the proposed system in automatic mass identification in mammograms.
