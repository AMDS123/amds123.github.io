##### Abstract
Artificial Intelligence is a central topic in the computer science curriculum. From the year 2011 a project-based learning methodology based on computer games has been designed and implemented into the intelligence artificial course at the University of the Bio-Bio. The project aims to develop software-controlled agents (bots) which are programmed by using heuristic algorithms seen during the course. This methodology allows us to obtain good learning results, however several challenges have been founded during its implementation. 
 In this paper we show how linguistic descriptions of data can help to provide students and teachers with technical and personalized feedback about the learned algorithms. Algorithm behavior profile and a new Turing test for computer games bots based on linguistic modelling of complex phenomena are also proposed in order to deal with such challenges. 
 In order to show and explore the possibilities of this new technology, a web platform has been designed and implemented by one of authors and its incorporation in the process of assessment allows us to improve the teaching learning process.

人工智能是计算机科学课程的核心课题。从2011年开始，基于计算机游戏的基于项目的学习方法已经被设计和实施到生物生物大学的智能人工课程中。该项目旨在开发软件控制的代理（机器人），这些代理使用启发式算法编程。这种方法使我们能够获得良好的学习成果，但是在实施过程中却遇到了一些挑战。
 在本文中，我们将展示数据的语言描述如何帮助学生和教师提供有关学习算法的技术和个性化反馈。为了应对这些挑战，还提出了基于复杂现象的语言建模的计算机游戏机器人的算法行为轮廓和新的图灵测试。
 为了展示和探索这种新技术的可能性，一位作者设计和实施了一个网络平台，并将其纳入评估过程，使我们能够改进教学过程。
