##### Abstract
Multi-object tracking remains challenging due to frequent occurrence of occlusions and outliers. In order to handle this problem, we propose an Approximation-Shrink Scheme for sequential optimization. This scheme is realized by introducing an Ambiguity-Clearness Graph to avoid conflicts and maintain sequence independent, as well as a sliding window optimization framework to constrain the size of state space and guarantee convergence. Based on this window-wise framework, the states of targets are clustered in a self-organizing manner. Moreover, we show that the traditional online and batch tracking methods can be embraced by the window-wise framework. Experiments indicate that with only a small window, the optimization performance can be much better than online methods and approach to batch methods.

由于频繁出现遮挡和异常值，多目标跟踪仍然具有挑战性。为了处理这个问题，我们提出了一个近似 - 收缩方案来进行顺序优化。该方案通过引入模糊 - 清晰图来避免冲突，保持序列无关性，以及滑动窗口优化框架来约束状态空间的大小，保证收敛。在此窗口框架的基础上，目标状态以自组织的方式聚集在一起。此外，我们表明，传统的在线和批量跟踪方法可以通过窗口框架来支持。实验表明，只有一个小窗口，优化性能可以比在线方法和批处理方法好得多。
