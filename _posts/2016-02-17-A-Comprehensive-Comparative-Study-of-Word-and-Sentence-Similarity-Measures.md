##### Abstract
Sentence similarity is considered the basis of many natural language tasks such as information retrieval, question answering and text summarization. The semantic meaning between compared text fragments is based on the words semantic features and their relationships. This article reviews a set of word and sentence similarity measures and compares them on benchmark datasets. On the studied datasets, results showed that hybrid semantic measures perform better than both knowledge and corpus based measures.

##### Abstract (translated by Google)
句子相似性被认为是许多自然语言任务的基础，如信息检索，问题回答和文本摘要。比较文本片段之间的语义意义是基于单词的语义特征及其关系。本文回顾了一套词和句子的相似性度量，并在基准数据集上进行比较。在所研究的数据集上，结果显示混合语义测量比基于知识和基于语料库的测量更好。
