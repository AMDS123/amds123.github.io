##### Abstract
We present a new unsupervised learning algorithm, "FAIM", for 3D medical image registration. Based on a convolutional neural net, FAIM learns from a training set of pairs of images, without needing ground truth information such as landmarks or dense registrations. Once trained, FAIM can register a new pair of images in less than a second, with competitive quality. We compared FAIM with a similar method, VoxelMorph, as well as a diffeomorphic method, uTIlzReg GeoShoot, on the LPBA40 and Mindboggle101 datasets. Results for FAIM were comparable or better than the other methods on pairwise registrations. The effect of different regularization choices on the predicted deformations is briefly investigated. Finally, an application to fast construction of a template and atlas is demonstrated.
