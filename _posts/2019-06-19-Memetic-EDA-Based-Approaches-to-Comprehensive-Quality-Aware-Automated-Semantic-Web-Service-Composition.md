##### Abstract
Comprehensive quality-aware automated semantic web service composition is an NP-hard problem, where service composition workflows are unknown, and comprehensive quality, i.e., Quality of services (QoS) and Quality of semantic matchmaking (QoSM) are simultaneously optimized. The objective of this problem is to find a solution with optimized or near-optimized overall QoS and QoSM within polynomial time over a service request. In this paper, we proposed novel memetic EDA-based approaches to tackle this problem. The proposed method investigates the effectiveness of several neighborhood structures of composite services by proposing domain-dependent local search operators. Apart from that, a joint strategy of the local search procedure is proposed to integrate with a modified EDA to reduce the overall computation time of our memetic approach. To better demonstrate the effectiveness and scalability of our approach, we create a more challenging, augmented version of the service composition benchmark based on WSC-08 \cite{bansal2008wsc} and WSC-09 \cite{kona2009wsc}. Experimental results on this benchmark show that one of our proposed memetic EDA-based approach (i.e., MEEDA-LOP) significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art algorithms.
