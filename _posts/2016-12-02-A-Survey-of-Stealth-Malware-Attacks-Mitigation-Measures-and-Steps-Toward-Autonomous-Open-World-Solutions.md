##### Abstract
As our professional, social, and financial existences become increasingly digitized and as our government, healthcare, and military infrastructures rely more on computer technologies, they present larger and more lucrative targets for malware. Stealth malware in particular poses an increased threat because it is specifically designed to evade detection mechanisms, spreading dormant, in the wild for extended periods of time, gathering sensitive information or positioning itself for a high-impact zero-day attack. Policing the growing attack surface requires the development of efficient anti-malware solutions with improved generalization to detect novel types of malware and resolve these occurrences with as little burden on human experts as possible. In this paper, we survey malicious stealth technologies as well as existing solutions for detecting and categorizing these countermeasures autonomously. While machine learning offers promising potential for increasingly autonomous solutions with improved generalization to new malware types, both at the network level and at the host level, our findings suggest that several flawed assumptions inherent to most recognition algorithms prevent a direct mapping between the stealth malware recognition problem and a machine learning solution. The most notable of these flawed assumptions is the closed world assumption: that no sample belonging to a class outside of a static training set will appear at query time. We present a formalized adaptive open world framework for stealth malware recognition and relate it mathematically to research from other machine learning domains.

随着我们的专业，社会和金融生存日益数字化，以及政府，医疗保健和军事基础设施更多地依赖计算机技术，它们为恶意软件提供了更大更有利可图的目标。特别是隐形恶意软件会带来越来越大的威胁，因为它专门设计用于逃避检测机制，长时间散布休眠状态，收集敏感信息或将自身定位为高影响零日攻击。警惕不断增长的攻击面需要开发高效的反恶意软件解决方案，通过改进泛化来检测新型恶意软件，并尽可能减轻人为专家的负担，从而解决这些问题。在本文中，我们调查了恶意隐形技术以及现有的自主检测和分类对策的解决方案。虽然机器学习为日益自治的解决方案提供了有希望的潜力，并且在网络级别和主机级别上对新型恶意软件类型进行了改进，但我们的研究结果表明，大多数识别算法固有的一些有缺陷的假设阻止了隐形恶意软件识别问题和机器学习解决方案。这些有缺陷的假设中最值得注意的是封闭的世界假设：在查询时间内不会出现属于静态训练集以外的类的样本。我们提出了一个隐形恶意软件识别的正式自适应开放世界框架，并将其与其他机器学习领域的研究数学化地联系起来。
