##### Abstract
This paper addresses the task allocation problem for multi-robot systems. The main issue with the task allocation problem is inherent complexity that makes finding an optimal solution within a reasonable time almost impossible. To hand the issue, this paper develops a task allocation algorithm that can be decentralised by leveraging the submodularity concepts and sampling process. The theoretical analysis reveals that the proposed algorithm can provide approximation guarantee of $1/2$ for the monotone submodular case and $1/4$ for the non-monotone submodular case in average sense with polynomial time complexity. To examine the performance of the proposed algorithm and validate the theoretical analysis results, we design a task allocation problem and perform numerical simulations. The simulation results confirm that the proposed algorithm achieves solution quality, which is comparable to a state-of-the-art algorithm in the monotone case, and much better quality in the non-monotone case with significantly less computational complexity.
