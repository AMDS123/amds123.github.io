##### Abstract
The digital retina in smart cities is to select what the City Eye tells the City Brain, and convert the acquired visual data from front-end visual sensors to features in an intelligent sensing manner. By deploying deep learning and/or handcrafted models in front-end devices, the compact features can be extracted and subsequently delivered to back-end cloud for search and advanced analytics. In this context, we propose a model generation, utilization, and communication paradigm, aiming to address a set of unique challenges for better artificial intelligence services in smart cities. In particular, we present an integrated multiple deep learning models reuse and prediction strategy, which greatly increases the feasibility of the digital retina in processing and analyzing the large-scale visual data in smart cities. The promise of the proposed paradigm is demonstrated through a set of experiments.
