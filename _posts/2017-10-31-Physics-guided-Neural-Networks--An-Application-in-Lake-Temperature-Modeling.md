##### Abstract
This paper introduces a novel framework for learning data science models by using the scientific knowledge encoded in physics-based models. This framework, termed as physics-guided neural network (PGNN), leverages the output of physics-based model simulations along with observational features to generate predictions using a neural network architecture. Further, we present a novel class of learning objective for training neural networks, which ensures that the model predictions not only show lower errors on the training data but are also \emph{consistent} with the known physics. We illustrate the effectiveness of PGNN for the problem of lake temperature modeling, where physical relationships between the temperature, density, and depth of water are used in the learning of neural network model parameters. By using scientific knowledge to guide the construction and learning of neural networks, we are able to show that the proposed framework ensures better generalizability as well as physical consistency of results.

本文介绍了一种利用基于物理模型编码的科学知识来学习数据科学模型的新框架。这个被称为物理引导神经网络（PGNN）的框架利用基于物理的模型模拟的输出以及观测特征来产生使用神经网络结构的预测。进一步，我们提出了一种新的训练神经网络的学习目标类别，它确保了模型预测不仅在训练数据上表现出较低的误差，而且与已知的物理学也是一致的。我们说明了PGNN对于湖泊温度建模问题的有效性，在神经网络模型参数的学习中使用温度，密度和水深之间的物理关系。通过利用科学知识来指导神经网络的构建和学习，我们能够证明所提出的框架确保了更好的泛化能力以及结果的物理一致性。
