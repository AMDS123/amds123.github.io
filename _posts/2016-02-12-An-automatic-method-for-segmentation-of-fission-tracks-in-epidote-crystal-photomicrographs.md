##### Abstract
Manual identification of fission tracks has practical problems, such as variation due to observer-observation efficiency. An automatic processing method that could identify fission tracks in a photomicrograph could solve this problem and improve the speed of track counting. However, separation of non-trivial images is one of the most difficult tasks in image processing. Several commercial and free softwares are available, but these softwares are meant to be used in specific images. In this paper, an automatic method based on starlet wavelets is presented in order to separate fission tracks in mineral photomicrographs. Automatization is obtained by Matthews correlation coefficient, and results are evaluated by precision, recall and accuracy. This technique is an improvement of a method aimed at segmentation of scanning electron microscopy images. This method is applied in photomicrographs of epidote phenocrystals, in which accuracy higher than 89% was obtained in fission track segmentation, even for difficult images. Algorithms corresponding to the proposed method are available for download. Using the method presented here, an user could easily determine fission tracks in photomicrographs of mineral samples.

##### Abstract (translated by Google)
手工识别裂变径迹存在实际问题，如由观察者观察效率引起的变化。一种可以识别显微照片中的裂变迹线的自动处理方法可以解决这个问题并且提高计数的速度。然而，非平凡图像的分离是图像处理中最困难的任务之一。一些商业软件和免费软件是可用的，但这些软件是用于特定的图像。在本文中，为了分离矿物显微照片中的裂变径迹，提出了一种基于新星小波的自动方法。自动化是通过Matthews相关系数获得的，并且通过精确度，召回率和准确度来评估结果。该技术是针对扫描电子显微镜图像分割的方法的改进。这种方法应用于绿帘石晶体的显微照片中，即使对于困难的图像，在裂变径迹分割中获得高达89％的准确度。对应于所提出的方法的算法可以下载。使用这里介绍的方法，用户可以很容易地确定矿物样品的显微照片中的裂变轨迹。
