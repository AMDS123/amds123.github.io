##### Abstract
Road extraction from aerial images has been a hot research topic in the field of remote sensing image analysis. In this letter, a semantic segmentation neural network which combines the strengths of residual learning and U-Net is proposed for road area extraction. The network is built with residual units and has similar architecture to that of U-Net. The benefits of this model is two-fold: first, residual units ease training of deep networks. Second, the rich skip connections within the network could facilitate information propagation, allowing us to design networks with fewer parameters however better performance. We test our network on a public road dataset and compare it with U-Net and other two state of the art deep learning based road extraction methods. The proposed approach outperforms all the comparing methods, which demonstrates its superiority over recently developed state of the arts.

航空影像道路提取一直是遥感影像分析领域的研究热点。本文提出了一种结合剩余学习和U-Net强度的语义分割神经网络进行道路区域提取。该网络是用剩余单位构建的，具有与U-Net相似的架构。这种模式的好处是双重的：首先，剩余单位减轻深度网络的训练。其次，网络中丰富的跳过连接可以促进信息传播，使我们能够设计出更少参数的网络，但性能更好。我们在公共道路数据集上测试我们的网络，并将其与U-Net和其他两种最先进的基于深度学习的道路提取方法进行比较。所提出的方法优于所有的比较方法，这表明它比最近发展的艺术状态的优越性。
