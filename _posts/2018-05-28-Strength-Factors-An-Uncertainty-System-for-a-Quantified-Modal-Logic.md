##### Abstract
We present a new system S for handling uncertainty in a quantified modal logic (first-order modal logic). The system is based on both probability theory and proof theory. The system is derived from Chisholm's epistemology. We concretize Chisholm's system by grounding his undefined and primitive (i.e. foundational) concept of reasonablenes in probability and proof theory. S can be useful in systems that have to interact with humans and provide justifications for their uncertainty. As a demonstration of the system, we apply the system to provide a solution to the lottery paradox. Another advantage of the system is that it can be used to provide uncertainty values for counterfactual statements. Counterfactuals are statements that an agent knows for sure are false. Among other cases, counterfactuals are useful when systems have to explain their actions to users. Uncertainties for counterfactuals fall out naturally from our system. 
 Efficient reasoning in just simple first-order logic is a hard problem. Resolution-based first-order reasoning systems have made significant progress over the last several decades in building systems that have solved non-trivial tasks (even unsolved conjectures in mathematics). We present a sketch of a novel algorithm for reasoning that extends first-order resolution. 
 Finally, while there have been many systems of uncertainty for propositional logics, first-order logics and propositional modal logics, there has been very little work in building systems of uncertainty for first-order modal logics. The work described below is in progress; and once finished will address this lack.

我们提出了一个新的系统S来处理量化模态逻辑（一阶模态逻辑）中的不确定性。该系统基于概率论和证明理论。该体系源于奇泽姆的认识论。我们通过在概率和证明理论中奠定他未定义的和原始的（即基础性的）合理性概念，来具体化奇泽姆的系统。 S可以用于必须与人交互并为其不确定性提供正当理由的系统。作为该系统的演示，我们应用该系统为彩票悖论提供解决方案。该系统的另一个优点是它可以用来为反事实陈述提供不确定性值。反事实是代理人确实知道的陈述是错误的。在其他情况下，当系统必须向用户解释他们的行为时，反事实是有用的。反事实的不确定性自然来自我们的系统。
 在简单的一阶逻辑中进行有效的推理是一个难题。在过去的几十年里，基于分辨率的一阶推理系统在解决非平凡任务（甚至未解决的数学猜想）的系统中取得了重大进展。我们提出了一种新颖的用于推理一阶分辨率的推理算法的草图。
 最后，尽管命题逻辑，一阶逻辑和命题模态逻辑存在许多不确定性系统，但在构建一阶模态逻辑的不确定性系统方面几乎没有工作。下述工作正在进行中;一旦完成就会解决这个问题。
