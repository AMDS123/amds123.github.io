##### Abstract
Human pose estimation - the process of recognizing a human's limb positions and orientations in a video - has many important applications including surveillance, diagnosis of movement disorders, and computer animation. While deep learning has lead to great advances in 2D and 3D pose estimation from single video sources, the problem of estimating 3D human pose from multiple video sensors with overlapping fields of view has received less attention. When the application allows use of multiple cameras, 3D human pose estimates may be greatly improved through fusion of multi-view pose estimates and observation of limbs that are fully or partially occluded in some views. Past approaches to multi-view 3D pose estimation have used probabilistic graphical models to reason over constraints, including per-image pose estimates, temporal smoothness, and limb length. In this paper, we present a pipeline for multi-view 3D pose estimation of multiple individuals which combines a state-of-art 2D pose detector with a factor graph of 3D limb constraints optimized with belief propagation. We evaluate our results on the TUM-Campus and Shelf datasets for multi-person 3D pose estimation and show that our system significantly out-performs the previous state-of-the-art with a simpler model of limb dependency.
