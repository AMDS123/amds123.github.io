##### Abstract
Word Embeddings have recently imposed themselves as a standard for representing word meaning in NLP. Semantic similarity between word pairs has become the most common evaluation benchmark for these representations, with vector cosine being typically used as the only similarity metric. In this paper, we report experiments with a rank-based metric for WE, which performs comparably to vector cosine in similarity estimation and outperforms it in the recently-introduced and challenging task of outlier detection, thus suggesting that rank-based measures can improve clustering quality.

词嵌入最近强加自己作为表示NLP中的词义的标准。词对之间的语义相似性已经成为这些表示中最常见的评估基准，向量余弦通常被用作唯一的相似性度量。在本文中，我们报告了基于秩的度量指标的WE实验，它在相似性估计中的向量余弦性能可比，并且在最近引入的异常值检测任务中胜过它，因此表明基于等级的度量可以提高聚类质量。
