##### Abstract
Surgical workflow analysis is of importance for understanding onset and persistence of surgical phases and individual tool usage across surgery and in each phase. It is beneficial for clinical quality control and to hospital administrators for understanding surgery planning. Video acquired during surgery typically can be leveraged for this task. Currently, a combination of convolutional neural network (CNN) and recurrent neural networks (RNN) are popularly used for video analysis in general, not only being restricted to surgical videos. In this paper, we propose a multi-task learning framework using CNN followed by a bi-directional long short term memory (Bi-LSTM) to learn to encapsulate both forward and backward temporal dependencies. Further, the joint distribution indicating set of tools associated with a phase is used as an additional loss during learning to correct for their co-occurrence in any predictions. Experimental evaluation is performed using the Cholec80 dataset. We report a mean average precision (mAP) score of 0.99 and 0.86 for tool and phase identification respectively which are higher compared to prior-art in the field.
