##### Abstract
Determining whether a pair of garments are compatible with each other is a challenging matching problem. Past works explored various embedding methods for learning such a relationship. This paper introduces using discriminative methods to learn compatibility, by formulating the task as a simple binary classification problem. We evaluate our approach using an established dataset of outfits created by non-experts and demonstrated an improvement of ~2.5% on established metrics over the state-of-the-art method. We introduce three new datasets of professionally curated outfits and show the consistent performance of our approach on expert-curated datasets. To facilitate comparing across outfit datasets, we propose a new metric which, unlike previously used metrics, is not biased by the average size of outfits. We also demonstrate that compatibility between two types of items can be query indirectly, and such query strategy yield improvements.
