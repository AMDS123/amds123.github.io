##### Abstract
Motivation: Protein secondary structure prediction can provide important information for protein 3D structure prediction and protein functions. Deep learning, which has been successfully applied to various research fields such as image classification and voice recognition, provides a new opportunity to significantly improve the secondary structure prediction accuracy. Although several deep-learning methods have been developed for secondary structure prediction, there is room for improvement. MUFold-SS was developed to address these issues. Results: Here, a very deep neural network, the deep inception-inside-inception networks (Deep3I), is proposed for protein secondary structure prediction and a software tool was implemented using this network. This network takes two inputs: a protein sequence and a profile generated by PSI-BLAST. The output is the predicted eight states (Q8) or three states (Q3) of secondary structures. The proposed Deep3I not only achieves the state-of-the-art performance but also runs faster than other tools. Deep3I achieves Q3 82.8% and Q8 71.1% accuracies on the CB513 benchmark.

动机：蛋白质二级结构预测可以为蛋白质三维结构预测和蛋白质功能提供重要信息。深度学习已经成功应用于图像分类，语音识别等各个研究领域，为二次结构预测准确性的提高提供了新的契机。尽管已经开发了用于二级结构预测的几种深度学习方法，但仍有改进的空间。开发MUFold-SS来解决这些问题。结果：在此基础上，提出了一个深度的神经网络 - 深度初始网络（Deep3I），用于蛋白质二级结构预测，并利用该网络实现了一个软件工具。该网络需要两个输入：蛋白质序列和由PSI-BLAST产生的图谱。输出是二级结构的预测的八个状态（Q8）或三个状态（Q3）。所提出的Deep3I不仅达到了最先进的性能，而且比其他工具运行得更快。在CB513基准测试中，Deep3I的准确率达到82.8％和81.8％。
