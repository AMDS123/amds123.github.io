##### Abstract
During the last decade, the applications of signal processing have drastically improved with deep learning. However areas of affecting computing such as emotional speech synthesis or emotion recognition from spoken language remains challenging. In this paper, we investigate the use of a neural Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) as a feature extractor for emotion recognition. We show that these features outperform the eGeMAPS feature set to predict the valence and arousal emotional dimensions, which means that the audio-to-text mapping learning by the ASR system contain information related to the emotional dimensions in spontaneous speech. We also examine the relationship between first layers (closer to speech) and last layers (closer to text) of the ASR and valence/arousal.

在过去的十年中，信号处理的应用随着深度学习而急剧提高。然而，影响计算的领域，如情感语音合成或口头语言的情绪识别仍然具有挑战性。在本文中，我们研究了使用神经自动语音识别（ASR）作为情感识别的特征提取器。我们表明，这些功能优于eGeMAPS功能集来预测效价和觉醒情绪维度，这意味着ASR系统的音频 - 文本映射学习包含与自发言语中情绪维度相关的信息。我们还研究了ASR的第一层（接近言语）和最后一层（接近文本）与价/觉醒之间的关系。
