##### Abstract
Automating the extraction and quantification of features from three-dimensional (3-D) image stacks is a critical task for advancing computer vision research. The union of 3-D image acquisition and analysis enables the quantification of biological resistance of a plant tissue to fungal infection through the analysis of attributes such as fungal penetration depth, fungal mass, and branching of the fungal network of connected cells. From an image processing perspective, these tasks reduce to segmentation of vessel-like structures and the extraction of features from their skeletonization. In order to sample multiple infection events for analysis, we have developed an approach we refer to as macroscopic microscopy. However, macroscopic microscopy produces high-resolution image stacks that pose challenges to routine approaches and are difficult for a human to annotate to obtain ground truth data. We present a synthetic hyphal network generator, a comparison of several vessel segmentation methods, and a minimum spanning tree method for connecting small gaps resulting from imperfections in imaging or incomplete skeletonization of hyphal networks. Qualitative results are shown for real microscopic data. We believe the comparison of vessel detectors on macroscopic microscopy data, the synthetic vessel generator, and the gap closing technique are beneficial to the image processing community.

从三维（3-D）图像堆栈中自动提取和量化特征是推进计算机视觉研究的关键任务。三维图像采集和分析的结合通过分析真菌渗透深度，真菌质量和连接细胞的真菌网络的分支等属性，能够定量植物组织对真菌感染的生物学抗性。从图像处理的角度来看，这些任务减少到船只状结构的分割以及从其骨架化中提取特征。为了采样多个感染事件进行分析，我们开发了一种我们称之为宏观显微镜的方法。然而，宏观显微镜产生的高分辨率图像堆栈对常规方法提出了挑战，并且人类难以注释以获得地面真实数据。我们提出了一个合成的菌丝网络生成器，比较几种血管分割方法，以及一个最小生成树方法，用于连接由于成像不完善或菌丝网络不完整的骨架化造成的小间隙。定性结果显示为真实的微观数据。我们认为，宏观显微镜数据，合成血管发生器和闭合缝隙技术的血管检测器的比较对图像处理界是有利的。
