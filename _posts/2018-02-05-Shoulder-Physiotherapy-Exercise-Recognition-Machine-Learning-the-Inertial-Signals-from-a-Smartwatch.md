##### Abstract
Objective: Participation in a physical therapy program is considered one of the greatest predictors of successful conservative management of common shoulder disorders. However, adherence to these protocols is often poor and typically worse for unsupervised home exercise programs. Currently, there are limited tools available for objective measurement of adherence in the home setting. The goal of this study was to develop and evaluate the potential for performing home shoulder physiotherapy monitoring using a commercial smartwatch. 
 Approach: Ten healthy adult subjects with no prior shoulder disorders performed seven exercises from an evidence-based rotator cuff physiotherapy protocol, while 6-axis inertial sensor data was collected from the active extremity. Within an activitation recognition chain (ARC) framework, four supervised learning algorithms were trained and optimized to classify the exercises: k-nearest neighbor (k-NN), random forest (RF), support vector machine classifier (SVC), and a convolutional recurrent neural network (CRNN). Algorithm performance was evaluated using 5-fold cross-validation stratified first temporally and then by subject. 
 Main Results: Categorical classification accuracy was above 98% for all algorithms on the temporally stratified cross validation, with the best performance achieved by the CRNN algorithm (99.6%). The subject stratified cross validation, which evaluated classifier performance on unseen subjects, yielded lower accuracies scores with RF performing best (87.3%). 
 Significance: This proof of concept study demonstrates the technical feasibility of a smartwatch device and supervised machine learning approach to more easily monitor and assess the at-home adherence of shoulder physiotherapy exercise protocols.

目的：参与物理治疗计划被认为是保守治疗常见肩关节疾病的最佳预测指标之一。然而，遵守这些协议往往是不好的，通常情况下，无监督的家庭锻炼计划更糟糕。目前，只有有限的工具可以在家庭环境中客观衡量遵守情况。这项研究的目标是开发和评估使用商业智能手表进行家庭肩部理疗监测的潜力。
 方法：10名健康成人未曾发生肩部疾病的成年受试者从基于证据的肩袖物理治疗方案中进行了7次练习，而从活动的肢体收集到6轴惯性传感器的数据。在激活识别链（ARC）框架内，训练和优化了四个监督学习算法，以对训练进行分类：k-最近邻（k-NN），随机森林（RF），支持向量机分类器（SVC）和卷积递归神经网络（CRNN）。算法的性能评估使用5倍交叉验证分层首先暂时，然后按主题。
 主要结果：对于时间分层交叉验证的所有算法，分类分类准确率均在98％以上，CRNN算法（99.6％）达到最佳性能。主题分层交叉验证，评估分类器表现在看不见的科目，产生较低的准确性分数射频表现最好（87.3％）。
 意义：这个概念证明研究证明了智能手表设备和监督机器学习方法的技术可行性，以更容易地监测和评估肩部理疗锻炼协议的家庭坚持。
