##### Abstract
Representing a word by its co-occurrences with other words in context is an effective way to capture the meaning of the word. However, the theory behind remains a challenge. In this work, taking the example of a word classification task, we give a theoretical analysis of the approaches that represent a word X by a function f(P(C|X)), where C is a context feature, P(C|X) is the conditional probability estimated from a text corpus, and the function f maps the co-occurrence measure to a prediction score. We investigate the impact of context feature C and the function f. We also explain the reasons why using the co-occurrences with multiple context features may be better than just using a single one. In addition, some of the results shed light on the theory of feature learning and machine learning in general.

通过与上下文中的其他单词的共现来表示单词是捕捉单词含义的有效方式。然而，背后的理论仍然是一个挑战。本文以单词分类任务为例，通过函数f（P（C | X））对表示单词X的方法进行理论分析，其中C为上下文特征，P（C | X）是从文本语料库估计的条件概率，并且函数f将共现度量映射到预测分数。我们调查上下文特征C和函数f的影响。我们还解释了为什么使用具有多个上下文特征的共现可能比仅使用单个特征更好。另外，一些结果总体上揭示了特征学习和机器学习的理论。
