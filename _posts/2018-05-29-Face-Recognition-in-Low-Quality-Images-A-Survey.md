##### Abstract
Low-resolution face recognition (LRFR) has received increasing attention over the past few years. Its applications lie widely in the real-world environment when high-resolution or high-quality images are hard to capture. One of the biggest demands for LRFR technologies is video surveillance. As the the number of surveillance cameras in the city increases, the videos that captured will need to be processed automatically. However, those videos or images are usually captured with large standoffs, arbitrary illumination condition, and diverse angles of view. Faces in these images are generally small in size. Several studies addressed this problem employed techniques like super resolution, deblurring, or learning a relationship between different resolution domains. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive review of approaches to low-resolution face recognition in the past five years. First, a general problem definition is given. Later, systematically analysis of the works on this topic is presented by catogory. In addition to describing the methods, we also focus on datasets and experiment settings. We further address the related works on unconstrained low-resolution face recognition and compare them with the result that use synthetic low-resolution data. Finally, we summarized the general limitations and speculate a priorities for the future effort.

低分辨率人脸识别（LRFR）在过去几年受到越来越多的关注。当高分辨率或高质量图像难以捕捉时，其应用广泛存在于真实世界的环境中。视频监控是LRFR技术最大的需求之一。随着城市监控摄像机数量的增加，捕获的视频将需要自动处理。但是，这些视频或图像通常会以较大的间距，任意照明条件和不同视角拍摄。这些图像中的脸部通常很小。一些研究针对这个问题采用了超分辨率，去模糊或学习不同分辨率域之间关系的技术。在本文中，我们对过去五年中低分辨率人脸识别的方法进行了全面回顾。首先给出一般的问题定义。后来，系统地分析了这个题目的作品是由catogory提出的。除了描述方法之外，我们还关注数据集和实验设置。我们进一步解决无约束低分辨率人脸识别的相关工作，并将其与使用合成低分辨率数据的结果进行比较。最后，我们总结了一般限制并推测了未来工作的优先顺序。
