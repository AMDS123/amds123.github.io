##### Abstract
Despite the evaluation systems of human movement that have been advancing in recent decades, their use are not feasible for clinical practice because it has a high cost and scarcity of trained operators to interpret their results. An ideal videogrammetry system should be easy to use, low cost, with minimal equipment, and fast realization. The CvMob is a free tool for dynamic evaluation of human movements that express measurements in figures, tables, and graphics. This paper aims to determine if CvMob is a reliable tool for the evaluation of two dimensional human gait. This is a validity and reliability study. The sample was composed of 56 healthy individuals who walked on a 9-meterlong walkway and were simultaneously filmed by CvMob and Vicon system cameras. Linear trajectories and angular measurements were compared to validate the CvMob system, and inter and intrarater findings of the same measurements were used to determine reliability. A strong correlation (rs mean = 0.988) of the linear trajectories between systems and inter and intrarater analysis were found. According to the Bland-Altman method, the angles that had good agreement between systems were maximum flexion and extension (stance and swing) of the knee and dorsiflexion range of motion and stride length. The CvMob is a reliable tool for analysis of linear motion and lengths in two-dimensional evaluations of human gait. The angular measurements demonstrate high agreement for the knee joint; however, the hip and ankle measurements were limited by differences between systems.

尽管近几十年来人体运动的评价系统一直在推进，但是它们的使用对于临床实践来说是不可行的，因为它具有高成本和经过培训的操作者对其结果的解释不足。一个理想的视频测量系统应该易于使用，成本低，设备少，实现快速。 CvMob是一个免费的动态评估人体运动的工具，用于表达图形，表格和图形中的测量数据。本文旨在确定CvMob是否是用于评估二维人类步态的可靠工具。这是一个有效性和可靠性研究。样本由56名健康人组成，他们走在9米长的走道上，同时由CvMob和Vicon系统摄像机拍摄。比较线性轨迹和角度测量结果来验证CvMob系统，并且使用相同测量的内部和内部结果来确定可靠性。发现系统之间的线性轨迹和内部和内部分析之间的强相关性（rs平均值= 0.988）。按照Bland-Altman方法，系统之间具有良好一致性的角度是膝关节的最大屈伸（伸展和摆动）以及背屈范围和步幅长度。 CvMob是用于分析人类步态的二维评估中的线性运动和长度的可靠工具。角度测量显示膝关节高度一致;然而，髋关节和踝关节测量受限于系统之间的差异。
