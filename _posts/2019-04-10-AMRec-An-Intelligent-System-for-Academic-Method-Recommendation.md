##### Abstract
Finding new academic Methods for research problems is the key task in a researcher's research career. It is usually very difficult for new researchers to find good Methods for their research problems since they lack of research experiences. In order to help researchers carry out their researches in a more convenient way, we describe a novel recommendation system called AMRec to recommend new academic Methods for research problems in this paper. Our proposed system first extracts academic concepts (Tasks and Methods) and their relations from academic literatures, and then leverages the regularized matrix factorization Method for academic Method recommendation. Preliminary evaluation results verify the effectiveness of our proposed system.
