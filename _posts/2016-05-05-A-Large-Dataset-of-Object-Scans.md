##### Abstract
We have created a dataset of more than ten thousand 3D scans of real objects. To create the dataset, we recruited 70 operators, equipped them with consumer-grade mobile 3D scanning setups, and paid them to scan objects in their environments. The operators scanned objects of their choosing, outside the laboratory and without direct supervision by computer vision professionals. The result is a large and diverse collection of object scans: from shoes, mugs, and toys to grand pianos, construction vehicles, and large outdoor sculptures. We worked with an attorney to ensure that data acquisition did not violate privacy constraints. The acquired data was irrevocably placed in the public domain and is available freely at this http URL .

我们创建了一万多个真实对象的3D扫描数据集。为了创建数据集，我们招募了70名操作员，为他们配备了消费级移动3D扫描装置，并支付他们扫描环境中的物体。操作人员在实验室外扫描他们选择的物体，而不受计算机视觉专业人员的直接监督。其结果是收集到大量的物体扫描图像：从鞋子，杯子，玩具到大钢琴，建筑车辆和大型户外雕塑。我们与律师合作确保数据采集不会违反隐私约束。获取的数据不可撤销地置于公共领域，并可通过此http URL自由获取。
