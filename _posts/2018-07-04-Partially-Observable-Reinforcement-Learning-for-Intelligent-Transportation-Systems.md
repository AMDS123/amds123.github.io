##### Abstract
Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) have attracted the attention of researchers and the general public alike as a means to alleviate traffic congestion. Recently, the maturity of wireless technology has enabled a cost-efficient way to achieve ITS by detecting vehicles using Vehicle to Infrastructure (V2I) communications. Traditional ITS algorithms, in most cases, assume that every vehicle is observed, such as by a camera or a loop detector, but a V2I implementation would detect only those vehicles with wireless communications capability. We examine a family of transportation systems, which we will refer to as `Partially Detected Intelligent Transportation Systems'. An algorithm that can act well under a small detection rate is highly desirable due to gradual penetration rates of the underlying wireless technologies such as Dedicated Short Range Communications (DSRC) technology. Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques for Reinforcement Learning (RL) are suitable tools for finding such an algorithm due to utilizing varied inputs and not requiring explicit analytic understanding or modeling of the underlying system dynamics. In this paper, we report a RL algorithm for partially observable ITS based on DSRC. The performance of this system is studied under different car flows, detection rates, and topologies of the road network. Our system is able to efficiently reduce the average waiting time of vehicles at an intersection, even with a low detection rate.

智能交通系统（ITS）已经引起研究人员和公众的注意，作为缓解交通拥堵的手段。最近，无线技术的成熟使得通过使用车辆到基础设施（V2I）通信检测车辆来实现ITS的成本有效方式。在大多数情况下，传统的ITS算法假设每个车辆都被观察到，例如通过摄像机或环路探测器，但V2I实现仅检测具有无线通信能力的车辆。我们研究了一系列交通系统，我们将其称为“部分检测智能交通系统”。由于诸如专用短程通信（DSRC）技术的基础无线技术的逐渐渗透率，非常期望能够在小检测率下良好地运行的算法。用于强化学习（RL）的人工智能（AI）技术是用于找到这样的算法的合适工具，因为利用了不同的输入并且不需要对基础系统动力学进行明确的分析理解或建模。在本文中，我们报告了基于DSRC的部分可观测ITS的RL算法。在不同的车流量，检测率和道路网络拓扑结构下研究该系统的性能。即使检测率低，我们的系统也能够有效地减少交叉路口车辆的平均等待时间。
