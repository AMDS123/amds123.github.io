##### Abstract
Networks represent relationships between entities in many complex systems, spanning from online social interactions to biological cell development and brain connectivity. In many cases, relationships between entities are unambiguously known: are two users 'friends' in a social network? Do two researchers collaborate on a published paper? Do two road segments in a transportation system intersect? These are directly observable in the system in question. In most cases, relationship between nodes are not directly observable and must be inferred: does one gene regulate the expression of another? Do two animals who physically co-locate have a social bond? Who infected whom in a disease outbreak in a population? 
 Existing approaches for inferring networks from data are found across many application domains and use specialized knowledge to infer and measure the quality of inferred network for a specific task or hypothesis. However, current research lacks a rigorous methodology which employs standard statistical validation on inferred models. In this survey, we examine (1) how network representations are constructed from underlying data, (2) the variety of questions and tasks on these representations over several domains, and (3) validation strategies for measuring the inferred network's capability of answering questions on the system of interest.

网络代表许多复杂系统中的实体之间的关系，从在线社交交互到生物细胞发展和大脑连接。在许多情况下，实体之间的关系是明确地知道的：在社交网络中是两个用户的“朋友”吗？两位研究人员在已发表的论文上合作吗？运输系统中的两个路段是否相交？这些在所讨论的系统中可以直接观察到。在大多数情况下，节点之间的关系不是直接可观的，必须推断：一个基因是否调控另一个基因的表达？两个身体共处的动物是否有社交联系？谁感染了一个人口中的疾病爆发？
 从数据中推断网络的现有方法在许多应用领域中找到，并且使用专业知识来推断和测量针对特定任务或假设的推断网络的质量。然而，目前的研究缺乏严格的方法，对推断模型采用标准统计验证。在本次调查中，我们考察了（1）如何从底层数据构建网络表示，（2）这些表示在多个领域的问题和任务的多样性，（3）测量推断网络回答问题的能力的验证策略感兴趣的系统。
