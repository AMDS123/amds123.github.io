##### Abstract
In the field of artificial intelligence, neuromorphic computing has been around for several decades. Deep learning has however made much recent progress such that it consistently outperforms neuromorphic learning algorithms in classification tasks in terms of accuracy. Specifically in the field of image classification, neuromorphic computing has been traditionally using either the temporal or rate code for encoding static images in datasets into spike trains. It is only till recently, that neuromorphic vision sensors are widely used by the neuromorphic research community, and provides an alternative to such encoding methods. Since then, several neuromorphic datasets as obtained by applying such sensors on image datasets (e.g. the neuromorphic CALTECH 101) have been introduced. These data are encoded in spike trains and hence seem ideal for benchmarking of neuromorphic learning algorithms. Specifically, we train a deep learning framework used for image classification on the CALTECH 101 and a collapsed version of the neuromorphic CALTECH 101 datasets. We obtained an accuracy of 91.66% and 78.01% for the CALTECH 101 and neuromorphic CALTECH 101 datasets respectively. For CALTECH 101, our accuracy is close to the best reported accuracy, while for neuromorphic CALTECH 101, it outperforms the last best reported accuracy by over 10%. This raises the question of the suitability of such datasets as benchmarks for neuromorphic learning algorithms.

在人工智能领域，神经形态计算已经存在了几十年。然而，深度学习取得了很多进展，使得它在准确性方面始终优于分类任务中的神经形态学习算法。具体地，在图像分类领域中，神经形态计算传统上使用时间或速率代码将数据集中的静态图像编码成尖峰序列。直到最近，神经形态视觉传感器才被神经形态研究界广泛使用，并提供了这种编码方法的替代方案。从那时起，已经引入了通过在图像数据集（例如，神经形态CALTECH 101）上应用这样的传感器而获得的几个神经形态数据集。这些数据在尖峰序列中编码，因此似乎是神经形态学习算法基准测试的理想选择。具体来说，我们在CALTECH 101上训练用于图像分类的深度学习框架，以及神经形态CALTECH 101数据集的折叠版本。我们分别获得了CALTECH 101和神经形态CALTECH 101数据集的准确度分别为91.66％和78.01％。对于CALTECH 101，我们的准确度接近于报告的最佳准确度，而对于神经形态CALTECH 101，它的性能优于最后报告的最佳准确度超过10％。这提出了这样的数据集作为神经形态学习算法的基准的适用性的问题。
