##### Abstract
Various sources have reported the WaveNet deep learning architecture being able to generate high-quality speech, but to our knowledge there haven't been studies on the interpretation or visualization of trained WaveNets. This study investigates the possibility that WaveNet understands speech by unsupervisedly learning an acoustically meaningful latent representation of the speech signals in its receptive field; we also attempt to interpret the mechanism by which the feature extraction is performed. Suggested by singular value decomposition and linear regression analysis on the activations and known acoustic features (e.g. F0), the key findings are (1) activations in the higher layers are highly correlated with spectral features; (2) WaveNet explicitly performs pitch extraction despite being trained to directly predict the next audio sample and (3) for the said feature analysis to take place, the latent signal representation is converted back and forth between baseband and wideband components.

有不同的消息来源报道WaveNet深度学习架构能够产生高质量的语音，但据我们所知，还没有关于训练的WaveNets的解释或可视化的研究。这项研究调查了WaveNet通过无监督地学习语言信号在其接受领域中具有声学意义的潜在表示来理解语音的可能性;我们也试图解释执行特征提取的机制。通过激活和已知声学特征（例如F0）的奇异值分解和线性回归分析提出，主要发现是（1）较高层中的激活与光谱特征高度相关; （2）尽管被训练直接预测下一个音频采样，并且（3）为了进行所述特征分析，但是WaveNet明确执行音调提取，潜在信号表示在基带和宽带分量之间来回转换。
