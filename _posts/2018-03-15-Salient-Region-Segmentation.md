##### Abstract
Saliency prediction is a well studied problem in computer vision. Early saliency models were based on low-level hand-crafted feature derived from insights gained in neuroscience and psychophysics. In the wake of deep learning breakthrough, a new cohort of models were proposed based on neural network architectures, allowing significantly higher gaze prediction than previous shallow models, on all metrics. However, most models treat the saliency prediction as a \textit{regression} problem, and accurate regression of high-dimensional data is known to be a hard problem. Furthermore, it is unclear that intermediate levels of saliency (ie, neither very high, nor very low) are meaningful: Something is either salient, or it is not. Drawing from those two observations, we reformulate the saliency prediction problem as a salient region \textit{segmentation} problem. We demonstrate that the reformulation allows for faster convergence than the classical regression problem, while performance is comparable to state-of-the-art. We also visualise the general features learned by the model, which are showed to be consistent with insights from psychophysics.

显着性预测在计算机视觉中是一个研究得很好的问题。早期显着性模型是基于从神经科学和心理物理学中获得的见解中获得的低级别手工特征。在深度学习突破之后，基于神经网络架构提出了一个新的模型队列，在所有度量标准上允许比先前的浅层模型有更高的注视预测。然而，大多数模型将显着性预测视为\ textit {regression}问题，并且高维数据的准确回归已知是一个难题。此外，还不清楚显着程度的中间水平（即既非常高也非非常低）是有意义的：某些事情要么是显着的，要么是显着的，或者不是显着的。从这两个观察得出，我们将显着性预测问题重新表述为显着区域\ textit {分割}问题。我们证明重构允许比经典回归问题更快的收敛性，而性能可以与最先进的技术相媲美。我们还可视化模型学到的一般特征，这些特征与心理物理学的见解一致。
