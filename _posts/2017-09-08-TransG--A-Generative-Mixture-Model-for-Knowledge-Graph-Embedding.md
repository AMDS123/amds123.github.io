##### Abstract
Recently, knowledge graph embedding, which projects symbolic entities and relations into continuous vector space, has become a new, hot topic in artificial intelligence. This paper addresses a new issue of multiple relation semantics that a relation may have multiple meanings revealed by the entity pairs associated with the corresponding triples, and proposes a novel Gaussian mixture model for embedding, TransG. The new model can discover latent semantics for a relation and leverage a mixture of relation component vectors for embedding a fact triple. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first generative model for knowledge graph embedding, which is able to deal with multiple relation semantics. Extensive experiments show that the proposed model achieves substantial improvements against the state-of-the-art baselines.

最近，将符号实体和关系投影到连续向量空间中的知识图嵌入已成为人工智能领域一个新的热点。本文针对多关系语义的一个新的问题，提出了一种新的高斯混合模型，即一个关系可能具有与相应三元组关联的实体对揭示的多重意义。新模型可以发现关系的潜在语义，并利用关系分量向量的混合来嵌入事实三元组。据我们所知，这是知识图嵌入的第一个生成模型，它能够处理多重关系语义。大量的实验表明，所提出的模型能够实现对现有基线的实质性改进。
