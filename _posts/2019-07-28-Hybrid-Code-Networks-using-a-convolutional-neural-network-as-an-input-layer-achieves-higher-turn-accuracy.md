##### Abstract
The dialogue management is a task of conversational artificial intelligence. The goal of the dialogue manager is to select the appropriate response to the conversational partner conditioned by the input message and recent dialogue state. Hybrid Code Networks is one of the models of dialogue managers, which uses an average of word embeddings and bag-of-words as input features. We perform experiments on Dialogue bAbI Task 6 and Alquist Conversational Dataset. The experiments show that the convolutional neural network used as an input layer of the Hybrid Code Network improves the model's turn accuracy.
