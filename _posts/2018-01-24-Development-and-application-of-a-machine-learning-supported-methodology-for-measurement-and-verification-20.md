##### Abstract
The foundations of all methodologies for the measurement and verification (M&amp;V) of energy savings are based on the same five key principles: accuracy, completeness, conservatism, consistency and transparency. The most widely accepted methodologies tend to generalise M&amp;V so as to ensure applicability across the spectrum of energy conservation measures (ECM's). These do not provide a rigid calculation procedure to follow. This paper aims to bridge the gap between high-level methodologies and the practical application of modelling algorithms, with a focus on the industrial buildings sector. This is achieved with the development of a novel, machine learning supported methodology for M&amp;V 2.0 which enables accurate quantification of savings. 
 A novel and computationally efficient feature selection algorithm and powerful machine learning regression algorithms are employed to maximise the effectiveness of available data. The baseline period energy consumption is modelled using artificial neural networks, support vector machines, k-nearest neighbours and multiple ordinary least squares regression. Improved knowledge discovery and an expanded boundary of analysis allow more complex energy systems be analysed, thus increasing the applicability of M&amp;V. A case study in a large biomedical manufacturing facility is used to demonstrate the methodology's ability to accurately quantify the savings under real-world conditions. The ECM was found to result in 604,527 kWh of energy savings with 57% uncertainty at a confidence interval of 68%. 20 baseline energy models are developed using an exhaustive approach with the optimal model being used to quantify savings. The range of savings estimated with each model are presented and the acceptability of uncertainty is reviewed. The case study demonstrates the ability of the methodology to perform M&amp;V to an acceptable standard in challenging circumstances.

所有节能测量和验证（M＆amp; V）方法的基础是基于相同的五个关键原则：准确性，完整性，保守性，一致性和透明度。最广泛接受的方法论倾向于概括M＆amp; V，以确保在节能措施（ECM）的范围内的适用性。这些没有提供严格的计算程序。本文旨在弥合高层次方法与建模算法实际应用之间的差距，重点放在工业建筑领域。这是通过为M＆amp; V 2.0开发新颖的，机器学习支持的方法来实现的，该方法能够对储蓄进行精确的量化。
 采用新颖且计算效率高的特征选择算法和强大的机器学习回归算法来最大化可用数据的有效性。使用人工神经网络，支持向量机，k-最近邻和多个普通最小二乘回归对基准期能耗进行建模。改进的知识发现和扩展的分析边界允许分析更复杂的能量系统，从而提高M＆amp; V的适用性。在大型生物医学制造设施中的案例研究被用来证明该方法能够准确量化现实条件下的储蓄。 ECM被发现导致604,527 kWh的节能，57％的不确定性，置信区间为68％。 20个基准能量模型是使用穷举方法开发的，最佳模型用于量化储蓄。介绍了每个模型估计的节约范围，并回顾了不确定性的可接受性。案例研究表明，在具有挑战性的情况下，该方法能够执行M＆amp; V达到可接受的标准。
