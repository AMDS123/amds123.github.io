##### Abstract
Group discussions are a way for individuals to exchange ideas and arguments in order to reach better decisions than they could on their own. One of the premises of productive discussions is that better solutions will prevail, and that the idea selection process is mediated by the (relative) competence of the individuals involved. However, since people may not know their actual competence on a new task, their behavior is influenced by their self-estimated competence --- that is, their confidence --- which can be misaligned with their actual competence. Our goal in this work is to understand the effects of confidence-competence misalignment on the dynamics and outcomes of discussions. To this end, we design a large-scale natural setting, in the form of an online team-based geography game, that allows us to disentangle confidence from competence and thus separate their effects. We find that in task-oriented discussions, the more-confident individuals have a larger impact on the group's decisions even when these individuals are at the same level of competence as their teammates. Furthermore, this unjustified role of confidence in the decision-making process often leads teams to under-perform. We explore this phenomenon by investigating the effects of confidence on conversational dynamics.

小组讨论是个人交流想法和争论以达到比自己更好的决策的一种方式。有意义的讨论的前提之一是更好的解决方案将占上风，而选择思路的过程是由相关个人的（相对）能力所调节的。但是，由于人们在新的任务中可能不知道自己的实际能力，所以他们的行为受到自我评估能力的影响---也就是他们的信心---可能与他们的实际能力不符。我们在这项工作中的目标是了解信心能力失调对讨论动态和结果的影响。为此，我们设计了一个以在线团队为基础的地理游戏形式的大规模自然环境，使我们能够把信心从能力中分离出来，从而分离它们的影响。我们发现，在面向任务的讨论中，即使这些人与其队友具有相同的能力水平，自信的人也会对团队的决策产生更大的影响。而且，在决策过程中这种无理的信任角色常常导致团队表现不佳。我们通过调查信心对会话动态的影响来探究这种现象。
