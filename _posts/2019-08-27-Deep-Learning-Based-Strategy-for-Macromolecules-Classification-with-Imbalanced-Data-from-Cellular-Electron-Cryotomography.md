##### Abstract
Deep learning model trained by imbalanced data may not work satisfactorily since it could be determined by major classes and thus may ignore the classes with small amount of data. In this paper, we apply deep learning based imbalanced data classification for the first time to cellular macromolecular complexes captured by Cryo-electron tomography (Cryo-ET). We adopt a range of strategies to cope with imbalanced data, including data sampling, bagging, boosting, Genetic Programming based method and. Particularly, inspired from Inception 3D network, we propose a multi-path CNN model combining focal loss and mixup on the Cryo-ET dataset to expand the dataset, where each path had its best performance corresponding to each type of data and let the network learn the combinations of the paths to improve the classification performance. In addition, extensive experiments have been conducted to show our proposed method is flexible enough to cope with different number of classes by adjusting the number of paths in our multi-path model. To our knowledge, this work is the first application of deep learning methods of dealing with imbalanced data to the internal tissue classification of cell macromolecular complexes, which opened up a new path for cell classification in the field of computational biology.
