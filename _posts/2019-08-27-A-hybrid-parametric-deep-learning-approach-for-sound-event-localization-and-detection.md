##### Abstract
This work describes and discusses an algorithm submitted to the Sound Event Localization and Detection Task of DCASE2019 Challenge. The proposed methodology relies on parametric spatial audio analysis for source localization and detection, combined with a deep learning-based monophonic event classifier. The evaluation of the proposed algorithm yields overall results comparable to the baseline system. The main highlight is a reduction of the localization error on the evaluation dataset by a factor of 2.6, compared with the baseline performance.
