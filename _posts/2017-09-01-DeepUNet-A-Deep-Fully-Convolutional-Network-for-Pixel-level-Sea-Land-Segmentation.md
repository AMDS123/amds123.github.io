##### Abstract
Semantic segmentation is a fundamental research in remote sensing image processing. Because of the complex maritime environment, the sea-land segmentation is a challenging task. Although the neural network has achieved excellent performance in semantic segmentation in the last years, there are a few of works using CNN for sea-land segmentation and the results could be further improved. This paper proposes a novel deep convolution neural network named DeepUNet. Like the U-Net, its structure has a contracting path and an expansive path to get high resolution output. But differently, the DeepUNet uses DownBlocks instead of convolution layers in the contracting path and uses UpBlock in the expansive path. The two novel blocks bring two new connections that are U-connection and Plus connection. They are promoted to get more precise segmentation results. To verify our network architecture, we made a new challenging sea-land dataset and compare the DeepUNet on it with the SegNet and the U-Net. Experimental results show that DeepUNet achieved good performance compared with other architectures, especially in high-resolution remote sensing imagery.

语义分割是遥感图像处理的基础研究。由于海洋环境复杂，海域划分是一项艰巨的任务。尽管近年来神经网络在语义分割方面取得了很好的效果，但有一些使用CNN进行海陆分割的工作，结果可以进一步改善。本文提出了一种新的深度卷积神经网络DeepUNet。像U-Net一样，它的结构有一个缩小的路径和一个扩展的路径来获得高分辨率的输出。但不同的是，DeepUNet使用DownBlocks而不是合同路径中的卷积层，并在膨胀路径中使用UpBlock。两个新颖的块带来两个新的连接，即U连接和Plus连接。他们被提升以获得更精确的分割结果。为了验证我们的网络架构，我们做了一个新的具有挑战性的海陆数据集，并将其与SegNet和U-Net进行比较。实验结果表明，DeepUNet与其他体系结构相比，取得了较好的性能，尤其是高分辨率遥感影像。
