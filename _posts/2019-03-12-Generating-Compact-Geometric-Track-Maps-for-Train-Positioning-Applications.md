##### Abstract
In this paper we present a method to generate compact geometric track-maps for train-borne localization applications. We first give a brief overview on the role of track maps and it becomes apparent that there are hardly any adequate methods to generate suitable geometric track-maps. Therefore, we present a novel map generation procedure that uses an optimization formulation to find the continuous sequence of track geometries that fits the available measurement data best. The optimization is initialized with the results from a localization filter developed in our previous work. The filter also provides the required information for shape identification and measurement association. The approach will be evaluated using simulated data in comparison to the typically used data-point based maps.
