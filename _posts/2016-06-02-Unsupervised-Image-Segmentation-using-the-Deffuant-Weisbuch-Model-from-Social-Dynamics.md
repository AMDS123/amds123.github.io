##### Abstract
Unsupervised image segmentation algorithms aim at identifying disjoint homogeneous regions in an image, and have been subject to considerable attention in the machine vision community. In this paper, a popular theoretical model with it's origins in statistical physics and social dynamics, known as the Deffuant-Weisbuch model, is applied to the image segmentation problem. The Deffuant-Weisbuch model has been found to be useful in modelling the evolution of a closed system of interacting agents characterised by their opinions or beliefs, leading to the formation of clusters of agents who share a similar opinion or belief at steady state. In the context of image segmentation, this paper considers a pixel as an agent and it's colour property as it's opinion, with opinion updates as per the Deffuant-Weisbuch model. Apart from applying the basic model to image segmentation, this paper incorporates adjacency and neighbourhood information in the model, which factors in the local similarity and smoothness properties of images. Convergence is reached when the number of unique pixel opinions, i.e., the number of colour centres, matches the pre-specified number of clusters. Experiments are performed on a set of images from the Berkeley Image Segmentation Dataset and the results are analysed both qualitatively and quantitatively, which indicate that this simple and intuitive method is promising for image segmentation. To the best of the knowledge of the author, this is the first work where a theoretical model from statistical physics and social dynamics has been successfully applied to image processing.

无监督的图像分割算法旨在识别图像中不相交的均匀区域，并在机器视觉领域受到相当多的关注。本文将统计物理和社会动力学的一个流行理论模型称为Deffuant-Weisbuch模型，应用于图像分割问题。 Deffuant-Weisbuch模型被发现可用于模拟以其观点或信念为特征的相互作用因素的封闭系统的演变，从而导致在稳定状态下共享相似观点或信念的代理群集的形成。在图像分割的背景下，本文考虑像素作为代理，它是意见的颜色属性，意见更新根据Deffuant-Weisbuch模型。除了将基本模型应用于图像分割之外，本文在模型中引入邻接关系和邻域信息，这些因素决定了图像的局部相似性和平滑性。当唯一像素观察的数量，即色心的数量与预定数量的簇匹配时，达到会聚。对Berkeley图像分割数据集的一组图像进行实验，并对结果进行定性和定量分析，表明这种简单直观的方法对于图像分割是有前途的。就作者所知，这是第一个将统计物理学和社会动力学理论模型成功应用于图像处理的工作。
