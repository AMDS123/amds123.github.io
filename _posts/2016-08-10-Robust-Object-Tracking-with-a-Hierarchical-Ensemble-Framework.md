##### Abstract
Autonomous robots enjoy a wide popularity nowadays and have been applied in many applications, such as home security, entertainment, delivery, navigation and guidance. It is vital to robots to track objects accurately in these applications, so it is necessary to focus on tracking algorithms to improve the robustness and accuracy. In this paper, we propose a robust object tracking algorithm based on a hierarchical ensemble framework which can incorporate information including individual pixel features, local patches and holistic target models. The framework combines multiple ensemble models simultaneously instead of using a single ensemble model individually. A discriminative model which accounts for the matching degree of local patches is adopted via a bottom ensemble layer, and a generative model which exploits holistic templates is used to search for the object through the middle ensemble layer as well as an adaptive Kalman filter. We test the proposed tracker on challenging benchmark image sequences. Both qualitative and quantitative evaluations demonstrate that the proposed tracker performs superiorly against several state-of-the-art algorithms, especially when the appearance changes dramatically and the occlusions occur.

自主机器人在当今享有广泛的知名度，已被广泛应用于家庭安防，娱乐，交付，导航，导航等领域。机器人在这些应用中准确地跟踪对象是至关重要的，因此有必要关注跟踪算法以提高鲁棒性和准确性。在本文中，我们提出了一种基于分层集成框架的鲁棒目标跟踪算法，该集成框架可以合并包括单个像素特征，局部块和整体目标模型的信息。该框架同时结合多个集合模型，而不是单独使用单个集合模型。通过底层集合层采用一个判别局部块匹配程度的判别模型，利用整体模板生成模型，通过中间集合层和自适应卡尔曼滤波器进行搜索。我们在具有挑战性的基准图像序列上测试提出的跟踪器定性和定量评估均表明，所提出的跟踪器能够在多种先进的算法上表现优异，特别是当外观发生显着变化并出现遮挡时。
