##### Abstract
Deep compositional models of meaning acting on distributional representations of words in order to produce vectors of larger text constituents are evolving to a popular area of NLP research. We detail a compositional distributional framework based on a rich form of word embeddings that aims at facilitating the interactions between words in the context of a sentence. Embeddings and composition layers are jointly learned against a generic objective that enhances the vectors with syntactic information from the surrounding context. Furthermore, each word is associated with a number of senses, the most plausible of which is selected dynamically during the composition process. We evaluate the produced vectors qualitatively and quantitatively with positive results. At the sentence level, the effectiveness of the framework is demonstrated on the MSRPar task, for which we report results within the state-of-the-art range.

为了产生更大文本成分的载体，作用于词语分布表示的深层意义组成模型正在发展成为NLP研究的热门领域。我们详细介绍了一个基于丰富形式的词嵌入的组成分布框架，旨在促进单词在句子环境中的相互作用。嵌入和合成层共同学习一个通用的目标，从周围的上下文增强语法信息向量。此外，每个单词与许多感官相关联，其中最有可能的是在合成过程中动态选择的。我们评估产生的载体定性和定量的积极成果。在句子层面上，框架的有效性在MSRPar任务中得到证明，为此我们在最先进的范围内报告结果。
