##### Abstract
Although General Game Playing (GGP) systems can facilitate useful research in Artificial Intelligence (AI) for game-playing, they are often computationally inefficient and somewhat specialised to a specific class of games. However, since the start of this year, two General Game Systems have emerged that provide efficient alternatives to the academic state of the art -- the Game Description Language (GDL). In order of publication, these are the Regular Boardgames language (RBG), and the Ludii system. This paper offers an experimental evaluation of Ludii. Here, we focus mainly on a comparison between the two new systems in terms of two key properties for any GGP system: simplicity/clarity (e.g. human-readability), and efficiency.
