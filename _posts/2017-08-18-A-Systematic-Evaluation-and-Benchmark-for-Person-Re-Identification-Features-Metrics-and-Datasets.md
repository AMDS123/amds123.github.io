##### Abstract
Person re-identification (re-id) is a critical problem in video analytics applications such as security and surveillance. The public release of several datasets and code for vision algorithms has facilitated rapid progress in this area over the last few years. However, directly comparing re-id algorithms reported in the literature has become difficult since a wide variety of features, experimental protocols, and evaluation metrics are employed. In order to address this need, we present an extensive review and performance evaluation of single- and multi-shot re-id algorithms. The experimental protocol incorporates the most recent advances in both feature extraction and metric learning. To ensure a fair comparison, all of the approaches were implemented using a unified code library that includes 11 feature extraction algorithms and 22 metric learning and ranking techniques. All approaches were evaluated using a new large-scale dataset that closely mimics a real-world problem setting, in addition to 16 other publicly available datasets: VIPeR, GRID, CAVIAR, DukeMTMC4ReID, 3DPeS, PRID, V47, WARD, SAIVT-SoftBio, CUHK01, CHUK02, CUHK03, RAiD, iLIDSVID, HDA+ and Market1501. The evaluation codebase and results will be made publicly available for community use.

人员重新识别（re-id）是视频分析应用（如安全和监控）中的一个关键问题。在过去的几年中，公开发布的几个数据集和视觉算法代码已经促进了这一领域的快速发展。然而，直接比较文献中报道的重复算法已经变得困难，因为使用了各种各样的特征，实验协议和评估指标。为了解决这个问题，我们提出了一个广泛的回顾和性能评估的单和多镜头反向代码算法。实验协议结合了特征提取和度量学习的最新进展。为了确保公平的比较，所有的方法都使用统一的代码库来实现，包括11个特征提取算法和22个度量学习和排序技术。 VIPeR，GRID，CAVIAR，DukeMTMC4ReID，3DPeS，PRID，V47，WARD，SAIVT-SoftBio等都使用了一个新的大规模数据集来评估所有方法，这些数据集可以模拟真实世界的问题设置。 CUHK01，CHUK02，CUHK03，RAiD，iLIDSVID，HDA +和Market1501。评估代码库和结果将公开提供给社区使用。
