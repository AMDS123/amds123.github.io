##### Abstract
About one-fourth of the universe is thought to consist of dark matter. Yet there is no clear understanding about the nature of these particles. Commonly discussed dark matter candidates includes the so called WIMPs or weakly interacting massive particles with masses from about 10GeV to 1TeV. These particles can gravitate to form a new class of objects in dark matter halos or around the galactic centre. We study in some detail many properties of these objects; which are dark matter dominated and bound by their self gravity; their formation and possibilities of their detection. Implications of the presence of such objects for star formation are also discussed. These objects could provide the possibility of forming primordial black holes distinct from the usual Hawking black holes and they could also provide a scenario for short duration gamma ray bursts, avoiding the baryon load problem.
