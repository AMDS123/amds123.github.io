##### Abstract
About one-fourth of the universe is thought to consist of dark matter. Yet there is no clear understanding about the nature of these particles. Commonly discussed dark matter candidates includes the so called WIMPs or weakly interacting massive particles with masses from about 10GeV to 1TeV. These particles can gravitate to form a new class of objects in dark matter halos or around the galactic centre. We study in some detail many properties of these objects; which are dark matter dominated and bound by their self gravity; their formation and possibilities of their detection. Implications of the presence of such objects for star formation are also discussed. These objects could provide the possibility of forming primordial black holes distinct from the usual Hawking black holes and they could also provide a scenario for short duration gamma ray bursts, avoiding the baryon load problem.

大约四分之一的宇宙被认为是由暗物质构成的。然而对这些粒子的性质没有清楚的认识。通常讨论的暗物质候选物包括所谓的WIMP或弱相互作用的质量约10GeV到1TeV的大质量粒子。这些粒子可以在暗物质晕处或星系中心附近吸引形成一类新的物体。我们详细研究这些对象的许多属性;暗物质为主，受自身重力束缚;它们的形成和检测的可能性。还讨论了这些物体对恒星形成的影响。这些物体可以提供形成与通常的霍金黑洞截然不同的原始黑洞的可能性，并且还可以提供短时间伽马射线爆发的场景，避免重子负载问题。
