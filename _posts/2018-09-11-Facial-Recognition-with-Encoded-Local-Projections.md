##### Abstract
Encoded Local Projections (ELP) is a recently introduced dense sampling image descriptor which uses projections in small neighbourhoods to construct a histogram/descriptor for the entire image. ELP has shown to be as accurate as other state-of-the-art features in searching medical images while being time and resource efficient. This paper attempts for the first time to utilize ELP descriptor as primary features for facial recognition and compare the results with LBP histogram on the Labeled Faces in the Wild dataset. We have evaluated descriptors by comparing the chi-squared distance of each image descriptor versus all others as well as training Support Vector Machines (SVM) with each feature vector. In both cases, the results of ELP were better than LBP in the same sub-image configuration.

编码局部投影（ELP）是最近引入的密集采样图像描述符，其使用小邻域中的投影来构造整个图像的直方图/描述符。 ELP在搜索医学图像方面与其他最先进的功能一样准确，同时节省时间和资源。本文首次尝试利用ELP描述符作为面部识别的主要特征，并将结果与​​野生数据集中Labeled Faces上的LBP直方图进行比较。我们通过比较每个图像描述符与所有其他图像描述符的卡方距离以及使用每个特征向量训练支持向量机（SVM）来评估描述符。在这两种情况下，ELP的结果在相同的子图像配置中优于LBP。
