##### Abstract
Chinese characters have a huge set of character categories, more than 20,000 and the number is still increasing as more and more novel characters continue being created. However, the enormous characters can be decomposed into a compact set of about 500 fundamental and structural radicals. This paper introduces a novel radical analysis network (RAN) to recognize printed Chinese characters by identifying radicals and analyzing two-dimensional spatial structures among them. The proposed RAN first extracts visual features from input by employing convolutional neural networks as an encoder. Then a decoder based on recurrent neural networks is employed, aiming at generating captions of Chinese characters by detecting radicals and two-dimensional structures through a spatial attention mechanism. The manner of treating a Chinese character as a composition of radicals rather than a single character class largely reduces the size of vocabulary and enables RAN to possess the ability of recognizing unseen Chinese character classes, namely zero-shot learning.

汉字有很多字符类别，超过20,000，随着越来越多的新奇字符的继续创作，这个数字仍在增加。然而，巨大的角色可以分解成约500个基本和结构基团的紧凑集合。本文介绍了一种新的激进分析网络（RAN），通过识别自由基并分析其中的二维空间结构来识别印刷汉字。所提出的RAN首先通过使用卷积神经网络作为编码器从输入中提取视觉特征。然后采用基于递归神经网络的解码器，旨在通过空间注意机制检测自由基和二维结构来生成汉字字幕。将汉字作为一个激进而不是一个字符类的组合处理的方式在很大程度上减少了词汇的大小，使RAN能够识别不可见的汉字类，即零射击学习。
