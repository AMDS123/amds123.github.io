##### Abstract
Despite the appeal of deep neural networks that largely replace the traditional handmade filters, they still suffer from isolated cases that cannot be properly handled only by the training of convolutional filters. Abnormal factors, including real-world noise, blur, or other quality degradations, ruin the output of a neural network. These unexpected problems can produce critical complications, and it is surprising that there has only been minimal research into the effects of noise in the deep neural network model. Therefore, we present an exhaustive investigation into the effect of noise in image classification and suggest a generalized architecture of a dual-channel model to treat quality degraded input images. We compare the proposed dual-channel model with a simple single model and show it improves the overall performance of neural networks on various types of quality degraded input datasets.

尽管深度神经网络很大程度上取代了传统的手工滤波器，但它们仍然遭受着孤立的情况，这种情况只能通过卷积滤波器的训练才能正确处理。包括现实世界的噪声，模糊或其他质量下降的异常因素破坏了神经网络的输出。这些意想不到的问题会产生严重的并发症，令人惊讶的是，对深度神经网络模型中的噪声影响的研究很少。因此，我们对噪声在图像分类中的作用进行了详尽的研究，并提出了一个双通道模型的广义架构来处理质量下降的输入图像。我们将所提出的双通道模型与一个简单的单一模型进行比较，显示它改善了神经网络在各种质量退化输入数据集上的整体性能。
