##### Abstract
Although face recognition systems have achieved impressive performance in recent years, the low-resolution face recognition (LRFR) task remains challenging, especially when the LR faces are captured under non-ideal conditions, as is common in surveillance-based applications. Faces captured in such conditions are often contaminated by blur, nonuniform lighting, and nonfrontal face pose. In this paper, we analyze face recognition techniques using data captured under low-quality conditions in the wild. We provide a comprehensive analysis of experimental results for two of the most important applications in real surveillance applications, and demonstrate practical approaches to handle both cases that show promising performance. The following three contributions are made: {\em (i)} we conduct experiments to evaluate super-resolution methods for low-resolution face recognition; {\em (ii)} we study face re-identification on various public face datasets including real surveillance and low-resolution subsets of large-scale datasets, present a baseline result for several deep learning based approaches, and improve them by introducing a GAN pre-training approach and fully convolutional architecture; and {\em (iii)} we explore low-resolution face identification by employing a state-of-the-art supervised discriminative learning approach. Evaluations are conducted on challenging portions of the SCFace and UCCSface datasets.

尽管近年来人脸识别系统取得了令人印象深刻的性能，但低分辨率人脸识别（LRFR）任务仍然具有挑战性，尤其是在非理想条件下捕获LR人脸时，这一点在基于监控的应用中很常见。在这种情况下拍摄的脸部通常会受到模糊，不均匀照明和非正面脸部姿势的污染。在本文中，我们使用在野外低质量条件下捕获的数据分析人脸识别技术。我们为实际监测应用中两个最重要的应用提供了实验结果的综合分析，并展示了处理这两种表现出前景的性能的实际方法。以下三个贡献：{\ em（i）}我们进行实验来评估超分辨率方法的低分辨率人脸识别;我们研究了包括真实监视和大规模数据集的低分辨率子集在内的各种公共面部数据集的面部重​​新识别，为几种基于深度学习的方法提供了基准结果，并通过引入GAN预训练方法和完全卷积体系结构;和{\ em（iii）}我们通过采用最先进的监督辨别学习方法来探索低分辨率的人脸识别。对SCFace和UCCSface数据集的挑战性部分进行评估。
