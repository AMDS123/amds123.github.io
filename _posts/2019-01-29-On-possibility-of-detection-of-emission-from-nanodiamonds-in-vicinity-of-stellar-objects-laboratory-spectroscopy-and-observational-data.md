##### Abstract
Based on extensive laboratory characterization of presolar nanodiamonds extracted from mete-orites, we have proposed a novel approach to detect nanodiamonds at astrophysical objects using the 7370 {\AA} emission band arising from lattice defects. Details of laboratory spectroscopic studies and preliminary results of observations are presented.
