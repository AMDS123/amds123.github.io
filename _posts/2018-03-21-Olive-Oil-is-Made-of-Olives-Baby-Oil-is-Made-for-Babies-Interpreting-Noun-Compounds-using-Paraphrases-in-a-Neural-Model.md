##### Abstract
Automatic interpretation of the relation between the constituents of a noun compound, e.g. olive oil (source) and baby oil (purpose) is an important task for many NLP applications. Recent approaches are typically based on either noun-compound representations or paraphrases. While the former has initially shown promising results, recent work suggests that the success stems from memorizing single prototypical words for each relation. We explore a neural paraphrasing approach that demonstrates superior performance when such memorization is not possible.

##### Abstract (translated by Google)
自动解释名词化合物成分之间的关​​系，例如橄榄油（来源）和婴儿油（目的）是许多NLP应用的重要任务。最近的方法通常基于名词复合表示或释义。虽然前者最初显示出有希望的结果，但最近的研究表明，成功源于记忆每个关系的单个原型单词。我们探索一种神经复述方法，当这种记忆不可能时，它表现出优越的表现。
