##### Abstract
As the world population increases and arable land decreases, it becomes vital to improve the productivity of the agricultural land available. Given the weather and soil properties, farmers need to take critical decisions such as which seed variety to plant and in what proportion, in order to maximize productivity. These decisions are irreversible and any unusual behavior of external factors, such as weather, can have catastrophic impact on the productivity of crop. A variety which is highly desirable to a farmer might be unavailable or in short supply, therefore, it is very critical to evaluate which variety or varieties are more likely to be chosen by farmers from a growing region in order to meet demand. In this paper, we present our visual analytics tool, ViSeed, showcased on the data given in Syngenta 2016 crop data challenge 1 . This tool helps to predict optimal soybean seed variety or mix of varieties in appropriate proportions which is more likely to be chosen by farmers from a growing region. It also allows to analyse solutions generated from our approach and helps in the decision making process by providing insightful visualizations

随着世界人口的增加和耕地面积的减少，提高农地生产力成为关键。考虑到天气和土壤特性，农民需要做出关键的决定，比如要种植哪种种子，以什么比例种植，以最大限度地提高生产力。这些决定是不可逆转的，任何异常的外部因素，如天气，都可能对作物生产力产生灾难性的影响。对农民来说，一个非常可取的品种可能是无法供应或供应不足的，因此，评估哪些品种更适合种植区域的农民选择，以满足需求，这一点非常关键。在本文中，我们展示了我们的视觉分析工具ViSeed，展示了先正达2016年作物数据挑战1中给出的数据。这个工具有助于预测适宜比例的大豆种子品种或品种组合，这些更适合种植区域的农民选择。它还允许分析我们的方法生成的解决方案，并通过提供有洞察力的可视化帮助决策过程
