##### Abstract
We investigate the recently developed Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) model for the hyperpartisan news detection task. Using a subset of hand-labeled articles from SemEval as a validation set, we test the performance of different parameters for BERT models. We find that accuracy from two different BERT models using different proportions of the articles is consistently high, with our best-performing model on the validation set achieving 85% accuracy and the best-performing model on the test set achieving 77%. We further determined that our model exhibits strong consistency, labeling independent slices of the same article identically. Finally, we find that randomizing the order of word pieces dramatically reduces validation accuracy (to approximately 60%), but that shuffling groups of four or more word pieces maintains an accuracy of about 80%, indicating the model mainly gains value from local context.
