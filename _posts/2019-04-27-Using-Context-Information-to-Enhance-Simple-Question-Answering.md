##### Abstract
With the rapid development of knowledge bases(KBs),question answering(QA)based on KBs has become a hot research issue. In this paper,we propose two frameworks(i.e.,pipeline framework,an end-to-end framework)to focus answering single-relation factoid question. In both of two frameworks,we study the effect of context information on the quality of QA,such as the entity's notable type,out-degree. In the end-to-end framework,we combine char-level encoding and self-attention mechanisms,using weight sharing and multi-task strategies to enhance the accuracy of QA. Experimental results show that context information can get better results of simple QA whether it is the pipeline framework or the end-to-end framework. In addition,we find that the end-to-end framework achieves results competitive with state-of-the-art approaches in terms of accuracy and take much shorter time than them.
