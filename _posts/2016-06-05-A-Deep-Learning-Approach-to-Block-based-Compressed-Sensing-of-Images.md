##### Abstract
Compressed sensing (CS) is a signal processing framework for efficiently reconstructing a signal from a small number of measurements, obtained by linear projections of the signal. Block-based CS is a lightweight CS approach that is mostly suitable for processing very high-dimensional images and videos: it operates on local patches, employs a low-complexity reconstruction operator and requires significantly less memory to store the sensing matrix. In this paper we present a deep learning approach for block-based CS, in which a fully-connected network performs both the block-based linear sensing and non-linear reconstruction stages. During the training phase, the sensing matrix and the non-linear reconstruction operator are \emph{jointly} optimized, and the proposed approach outperforms state-of-the-art both in terms of reconstruction quality and computation time. For example, at a 25% sensing rate the average PSNR advantage is 0.77dB and computation time is over 200-times faster.

压缩感知（CS）是一种信号处理框架，用于通过对信号进行线性投影，从少量测量中高效地重构信号。基于块的CS是一种轻量级的CS方法，它主要适用于处理非常高维的图像和视频：它在本地补丁上运行，采用低复杂度的重构算子，并且需要更少的内存来存储传感矩阵。在本文中，我们提出了一种基于块的CS的深度学习方法，其中全连接网络执行基于块的线性传感和非线性重构阶段。在训练阶段，感知矩阵和非线性重构算子是共同优化的，所提出的方法在重建质量和计算时间方面均优于现有技术。例如，在25％的感测速率下，平均PSNR优势为0.77dB，计算时间超过200倍。
