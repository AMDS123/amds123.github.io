##### Abstract
Political speeches and debates play an important role in shaping the images of politicians, and the public often relies on media outlets to select bits of political communication from a large pool of utterances. It is an important research question to understand what factors impact this selection process. 
 To quantitatively explore the selection process, we build a three- decade dataset of presidential debate transcripts and post-debate coverage. We first examine the effect of wording and propose a binary classification framework that controls for both the speaker and the debate situation. We find that crowdworkers can only achieve an accuracy of 60% in this task, indicating that media choices are not entirely obvious. Our classifiers outperform crowdworkers on average, mainly in primary debates. We also compare important factors from crowdworkers' free-form explanations with those from data-driven methods and find interesting differences. Few crowdworkers mentioned that "context matters", whereas our data show that well-quoted sentences are more distinct from the previous utterance by the same speaker than less-quoted sentences. Finally, we examine the aggregate effect of media preferences towards different wordings to understand the extent of fragmentation among media outlets. By analyzing a bipartite graph built from quoting behavior in our data, we observe a decreasing trend in bipartisan coverage.

##### Abstract (translated by Google)
政治演讲和辩论在塑造政治家形象方面起着重要作用，而公众通常依靠媒体从大量话语中选择一些政治信息。了解哪些因素会影响选择过程是一个重要的研究问题。
 为了定量探讨选拔过程，我们建立了一个三十年的总统辩论记录和辩论后报道数据集。我们首先检查措辞的效果，并提出一个二元分类框架，控制说话人和辩论情况。我们发现，在这项任务中，众包工作者只能达到60％的准确率，这表明媒体选择并不完全明显。我们的分类器平均胜过众包工，主要是在初级辩论中。我们还将众包工人自由形式解释中的重要因素与数据驱动方法中的重要因素进行比较，并找出有趣的差异。很少有听众提到“语境很重要”，而我们的数据表明，同一位发言者的引语句比先前的话更加不同于引用较少引号的句子。最后，我们研究媒体偏好对不同字眼的总体影响，以了解媒体分散的程度。通过分析根据我们的数据引用行为构建的二分图，我们观察到两党覆盖率呈下降趋势。
