##### Abstract
This paper introduces a device, algorithm and graphical user interface to obtain anthropometric measurements of foot. Presented device facilitates obtaining scale of image and image processing by taking one image from side foot and underfoot simultaneously. Introduced image processing algorithm minimizes a noise criterion, which is suitable for object detection in single object images and outperforms famous image thresholding methods when lighting condition is poor. Performance of image-based method is compared to manual method. Image-based measurements of underfoot in average was 4mm less than actual measures. Mean absolute error of underfoot length was 1.6mm, however length obtained from side foot had 4.4mm mean absolute error. Furthermore, based on t-test and f-test results, no significant difference between manual and image-based anthropometry observed. In order to maintain anthropometry process performance in different situations user interface designed for handling changes in light conditions and altering speed of the algorithm.

本文介绍了一种设备，算法和图形用户界面，以获得足部的人体测量。所提出的装置通过从侧脚和脚下同时取得一个图像来有助于获得图像和图像处理的规模。引入图像处理算法使噪声标准最小化，适用于单目标图像中的目标检测，在光照条件差的情况下优于着名的图像阈值处理方法。将基于图像的方法的性能与手动方法进行比较。平均而言，基于图像的脚下测量比实际测量少4mm。脚下长度的平均绝对误差为1.6mm，但从侧脚获得的长度具有4.4mm的平均绝对误差。此外，基于t检验和f检验结果，手动和基于图像的人体测量没有显着差异。为了在不同情况下保持人体测量过程的性能，用户界面设计用于处理光照条件的变化和改变算法的速度。
