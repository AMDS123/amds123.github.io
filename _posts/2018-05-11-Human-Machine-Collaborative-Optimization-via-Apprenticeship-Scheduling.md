##### Abstract
Coordinating agents to complete a set of tasks with intercoupled temporal and resource constraints is computationally challenging, yet human domain experts can solve these difficult scheduling problems using paradigms learned through years of apprenticeship. A process for manually codifying this domain knowledge within a computational framework is necessary to scale beyond the ``single-expert, single-trainee" apprenticeship model. However, human domain experts often have difficulty describing their decision-making processes, causing the codification of this knowledge to become laborious. We propose a new approach for capturing domain-expert heuristics through a pairwise ranking formulation. Our approach is model-free and does not require enumerating or iterating through a large state space. We empirically demonstrate that this approach accurately learns multifaceted heuristics on a synthetic data set incorporating job-shop scheduling and vehicle routing problems, as well as on two real-world data sets consisting of demonstrations of experts solving a weapon-to-target assignment problem and a hospital resource allocation problem. We also demonstrate that policies learned from human scheduling demonstration via apprenticeship learning can substantially improve the efficiency of a branch-and-bound search for an optimal schedule. We employ this human-machine collaborative optimization technique on a variant of the weapon-to-target assignment problem. We demonstrate that this technique generates solutions substantially superior to those produced by human domain experts at a rate up to 9.5 times faster than an optimization approach and can be applied to optimally solve problems twice as complex as those solved by a human demonstrator.

协调代理人完成一系列相互耦合的时间和资源约束的任务在计算上是具有挑战性的，然而人类领域专家可以使用通过多年的学徒学习获得的范例来解决这些困难的调度问题。在计算框架内手工编写这一领域知识的过程是超越“单一专家，单一实习生”学徒制模式的必要条件。然而，人力领域专家往往难以描述他们的决策过程，导致我们提出了一种通过成对排序公式来捕获领域专家启发式的新方法，我们的方法是无模型的，并且不需要枚举或迭代大型状态空间，我们凭经验证明，这种方法准确地学习包含作业车间调度和车辆路径问题的综合数据集的多方面启发式算法，以及由解决武器 - 目标分配问题和医院资源分配问题的专家演示组成的两个实际数据集。证明通过学徒学习从人类调度演示中学到的政策可以成为可能大大提高了分支定界搜索最佳时间表的效率。我们在武器对目标分配问题的变体上采用了这种人机协作优化技术。我们证明，这种技术产生的解决方案远优于人类领域专家产生的解决方案，速度比优化方法快9.5倍，并且可以应用于最优解决两倍于人类示威者解决问题的问题。
