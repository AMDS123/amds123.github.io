##### Abstract
Fuzzy Rule Interpolation (FRI) reasoning methods have been introduced to address sparse fuzzy rule bases and reduce complexity. The first FRI method was the Koczy and Hirota (KH) proposed "Linear Interpolation". Besides, several conditions and criteria have been suggested for unifying the common requirements FRI methods have to satisfy. One of the most conditions is restricted the fuzzy set of the conclusion must preserve a Piece-Wise Linearity (PWL) if all antecedents and consequents of the fuzzy rules are preserving on PWL sets at {\alpha}-cut levels. The KH FRI is one of FRI methods which cannot satisfy this condition. Therefore, the goal of this paper is to investigate equations and notations related to PWL property, which is aimed to highlight the problematic properties of the KH FRI method to prove its efficiency with PWL condition. In addition, this paper is focusing on constructing benchmark examples to be a baseline for testing other FRI methods against situations that are not satisfied with the linearity condition for KH FRI.
