##### Abstract
With a widespread use of digital imaging data in hospitals, the size of medical image repositories is increasing rapidly. This causes difficulty in managing and querying these large databases leading to the need of content based medical image retrieval (CBMIR) systems. A major challenge in CBMIR systems is the semantic gap that exists between the low level visual information captured by imaging devices and high level semantic information perceived by human. The efficacy of such systems is more crucial in terms of feature representations that can characterize the high-level information completely. In this paper, we propose a framework of deep learning for CBMIR system by using deep Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) that is trained for classification of medical images. An intermodal dataset that contains twenty four classes and five modalities is used to train the network. The learned features and the classification results are used to retrieve medical images. For retrieval, best results are achieved when class based predictions are used. An average classification accuracy of 99.77% and a mean average precision of 0.69 is achieved for retrieval task. The proposed method is best suited to retrieve multimodal medical images for different body organs.

随着医院数字图像数据的广泛使用，医学图像库的规模正在迅速增加。这导致难以管理和查询这些大型数据库，导致需要基于内容的医学图像检索（CBMIR）系统。 CBMIR系统面临的主要挑战是成像设备捕获的低级视觉信息与人类感知的高级语义信息之间存在的语义鸿沟。这些系统的功能对于可以完全表征高层信息的特征表示来说更为重要。在本文中，我们提出了深度学习CBMIR系统的框架，使用深度卷积神经网络（CNN），对医学图像进行分类训练。包含二十四个类和五个模态的联运数据集被用来训练网络。学习到的特征和分类结果被用来检索医学图像。对于检索，当使用基于类别的预测时，获得最好的结果。检索任务的平均分类精度为99.77％，平均精度为0.69。所提出的方法最适合于检索不同身体器官的多模式医学图像。
