##### Abstract
This survey paper presents a detailed overview of the applications for deep learning in ophthalmic diagnosis using retinal imaging techniques. The need of automated computer-aided deep learning models for medical diagnosis is discussed. Then a detailed review of the available retinal image datasets is provided. Applications of deep learning for segmentation of optic disk, blood vessels and retinal layer as well as detection of red lesions are reviewed.Recent deep learning models for classification of retinal disease including age-related macular degeneration, glaucoma, diabetic macular edema and diabetic retinopathy are also reported.
