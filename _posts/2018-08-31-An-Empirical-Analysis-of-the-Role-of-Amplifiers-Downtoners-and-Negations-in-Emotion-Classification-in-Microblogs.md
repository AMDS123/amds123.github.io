##### Abstract
The effect of amplifiers, downtoners, and negations has been studied in general and particularly in the context of sentiment analysis. However, there is only limited work which aims at transferring the results and methods to discrete classes of emotions, e. g., joy, anger, fear, sadness, surprise, and disgust. For instance, it is not straight-forward to interpret which emotion the phrase "not happy" expresses. With this paper, we aim at obtaining a better understanding of such modifiers in the context of emotion-bearing words and their impact on document-level emotion classification, namely, microposts on Twitter. We select an appropriate scope detection method for modifiers of emotion words, incorporate it in a document-level emotion classification model as additional bag of words and show that this approach improves the performance of emotion classification. In addition, we build a term weighting approach based on the different modifiers into a lexical model for the analysis of the semantics of modifiers and their impact on emotion meaning. We show that amplifiers separate emotions expressed with an emotion- bearing word more clearly from other secondary connotations. Downtoners have the opposite effect. In addition, we discuss the meaning of negations of emotion-bearing words. For instance we show empirically that "not happy" is closer to sadness than to anger and that fear-expressing words in the scope of downtoners often express surprise.

已经研究了放大器，降频器和否定的影响，特别是在情绪分析的背景下。然而，只有有限的工作旨在将结果和方法转移到离散的情绪类别，例如。 g。，快乐，愤怒，恐惧，悲伤，惊讶和厌恶。例如，解释“不快乐”这一短语所表达的情感并不是直截了当的。通过本文，我们的目标是在情感词汇及其对文档级情感分类的影响（即Twitter上的微博）中更好地理解这些修饰词。我们为情感词的修饰语选择合适的范围检测方法，将其作为附加词包加入文档级情感分类模型中，并表明该方法提高了情感分类的表现。此外，我们将基于不同修饰符的术语加权方法构建为词汇模型，用于分析修饰语的语义及其对情感意义的影响。我们展示了放大器将与带有情感的词汇表达的情感从其他次要内涵中更清楚地分开。 Downtoners产生相反的效果。此外，我们讨论了带情绪词的否定的含义。例如，我们凭经验证明，“不快乐”更接近于悲伤而不是愤怒，而且在经济衰退者范围内表达恐惧的言语往往表示惊讶。
