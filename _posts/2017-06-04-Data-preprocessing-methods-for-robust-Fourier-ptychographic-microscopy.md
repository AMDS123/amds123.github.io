##### Abstract
Fourier ptychographic microscopy (FPM) is a recently proposed computational imaging technique with both high resolution and wide field-of-view. In current FP experimental setup, the dark-field images with high-angle illuminations are easily submerged by stray light and background noise due to the low signal-to-noise ratio, thus significantly degrading the reconstruction quality and also imposing a major restriction on the synthetic numerical aperture (NA) of the FP approach. To this end, an overall and systematic data preprocessing scheme for noise removal from FP's raw dataset is provided, which involves sampling analysis as well as underexposed/overexposed treatments, then followed by the elimination of unknown stray light and suppression of inevitable background noise, especially Gaussian noise and CCD dark current in our experiments. The reported non-parametric scheme facilitates great enhancements of the FP's performance, which has been demonstrated experimentally that the benefits of noise removal by these methods far outweigh its defects of concomitant signal loss. In addition, it could be flexibly cooperated with the existing state-of-the-art algorithms, producing a stronger robustness of the FP approach in various applications.

傅里叶形态显微镜（FPM）是最近提出的具有高分辨率和宽视场的计算成像技术。在当前的FP实验装置中，由于低信噪比，高角度照明的暗视野图像容易被杂散光和背景噪声淹没，因此显着降低了重建质量，并且对FP方法的合成数值孔径（NA）。为此，本文提出了一套全面系统的FP原始数据集噪声去除方案，包括采样分析以及曝光过度/曝光过度的处理，其次是消除未知杂散光，抑制不可避免的背景噪声，特别是高斯噪声和CCD暗电流在我们的实验。所报告的非参数方案有助于大幅度提高FP的性能，实验已经证明这些方法消除噪声的好处远远超过其伴随信号损失的缺陷。此外，它可以灵活地配合现有的最先进的算法，使得FP方法在各种应用中具有更强的鲁棒性。
