##### Abstract
Segmentation is a key step in analyzing and processing medical images. Due to the low fault tolerance in medical imaging, manual segmentation remains the de facto standard in this domain. Besides, efforts to automate the segmentation process often rely on large amounts of manually labeled data. While existing software supporting manual segmentation is rich in features and delivers accurate results, the necessary time to set it up and get comfortable using it can pose a hurdle for the collection of large datasets. This work introduces a client/server based online environment, referred to as Studierfenster (studierfenster.at), that can be used to perform manual segmentations directly in a web browser. The aim of providing this functionality in the form of a web application is to ease the collection of ground truth segmentation datasets. Providing a tool that is quickly accessible and usable on a broad range of devices, offers the potential to accelerate this process. The manual segmentation workflow of Studierfenster consists of dragging and dropping the input file into the browser window and slice-by-slice outlining the object under consideration. The final segmentation can then be exported as a file storing its contours and as a binary segmentation mask. In order to evaluate the usability of Studierfenster, a user study was performed. The user study resulted in a mean of 6.3 out of 7.0 possible points given by users, when asked about their overall impression of the tool. The evaluation also provides insights into the results achievable with the tool in practice, by presenting two ground truth segmentations performed by physicians.
