##### Abstract
Maritime vessels equipped with visible and infrared cameras can complement other conventional sensors for object detection. However, application of computer vision techniques in maritime domain received attention only recently. Maritime environment offers its own unique requirements and challenges. Assessment of quality of detections is a fundamental need in computer vision. However, the conventional assessment metrics suitable for usual object detection are deficient in maritime setting. Thus, a large body of related work in computer vision appears inapplicable to maritime setting at the first sight. We discuss the problem of defining assessment metrics suitable for maritime computer vision. We consider new bottom edge proximity metrics as assessment metrics for maritime computer vision. These metrics indicate that existing computer vision approaches are indeed promising for maritime computer vision and can play a foundational role in the emerging field of maritime computer vision.
