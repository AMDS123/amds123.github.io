##### Abstract
In this paper, we propose a physically inspired graph-theoretical clustering method, which first makes the data points organized into an attractive graph, called In-Tree, via a physically inspired rule, called Nearest Descent (ND). In particular, the rule of ND works to select the nearest node in the descending direction of potential as the parent node of each node, which is in essence different from the classical Gradient Descent or Steepest Descent. The constructed In-Tree proves a very good candidate for clustering due to its particular features and properties. In the In-Tree, the original clustering problem is reduced to a problem of removing a very few of undesired edges from this graph. Pleasingly, the undesired edges in In-Tree are so distinguishable that they can be easily determined in either automatic or interactive way, which is in stark contrast to the cases in the widely used Minimal Spanning Tree and k-nearest-neighbor graph. The cluster number in the proposed method can be easily determined based on some intermediate plots, and the cluster assignment for each node is easily made by quickly searching its root node in each sub-graph (also an In-Tree). The proposed method is extensively evaluated on both synthetic and real-world datasets. Overall, the proposed clustering method is a density-based one, but shows significant differences and advantages in comparison to the traditional ones. The proposed method is simple yet efficient and reliable, and is applicable to various datasets with diverse shapes, attributes and any high dimensionality

在本文中，我们提出了一种物理启发的图论理论聚类方法，它首先通过一种被称为最近下降（ND）的物理启发规则，将数据点组织成一个有吸引力的图，称为In-Tree。具体来说，ND的规则是选择势能下降方向的最近节点作为每个节点的父节点，这与传统的梯度下降或最陡下降本质上是不同的。构建的In-Tree由于其特殊的特性和特性而被证明是非常好的聚类候选者。在In-Tree中，原始聚类问题被简化为从这个图中去除极少数不希望的边的问题。令人高兴的是，In-Tree中的不需要的边缘是如此的可区分以至于它们能够以自动或者交互的方式被容易地确定，这与广泛使用的最小生成树和k-最近邻图中的情况形成鲜明对比。该方法中的簇号可以根据一些中间图很容易地确定，并且通过在每个子图（也是In-Tree）中快速搜索其根节点来容易地对每个节点进行聚类分配。所提出的方法在综合和现实世界的数据集上进行了广泛的评估。总体而言，所提出的聚类方法是基于密度的聚类方法，但是与传统方法相比显示出显着的差异和优势。该方法简单而有效，可靠，适用于各种形状，属性和高维数据集
