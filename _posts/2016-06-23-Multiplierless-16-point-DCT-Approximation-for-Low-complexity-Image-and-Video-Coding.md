##### Abstract
An orthogonal 16-point approximate discrete cosine transform (DCT) is introduced. The proposed transform requires neither multiplications nor bit-shifting operations. A fast algorithm based on matrix factorization is introduced, requiring only 44 additions---the lowest arithmetic cost in literature. To assess the introduced transform, computational complexity, similarity with the exact DCT, and coding performance measures are computed. Classical and state-of-the-art 16-point low-complexity transforms were used in a comparative analysis. In the context of image compression, the proposed approximation was evaluated via PSNR and SSIM measurements, attaining the best cost-benefit ratio among the competitors. For video encoding, the proposed approximation was embedded into a HEVC reference software for direct comparison with the original HEVC standard. Physically realized and tested using FPGA hardware, the proposed transform showed 35% and 37% improvements of area-time and area-time-squared VLSI metrics when compared to the best competing transform in the literature.

引入正交16点近似离散余弦变换（DCT）。所提出的变换既不需要乘法也不需要位移操作。引入了基于矩阵分解的快速算法，只需要44次加法 - 文献中最低的算术代价。为了评估所引入的变换，计算复杂度，与精确DCT的相似度以及编码性能度量。经典和最先进的16点低复杂度转换被用于比较分析。在图像压缩的情况下，通过PSNR和SSIM测量评估所提出的近似值，获得了竞争者中最佳的成本效益比。对于视频编码，所提出的近似被嵌入到HEVC参考软件中以与原始HEVC标准直接比较。使用FPGA硬件进行物理实现和测试，与文献中最好的竞争变换相比，所提出的变换显示了面积 - 时间和面积 - 时间平方的VLSI指标的改善了35％和37％。
