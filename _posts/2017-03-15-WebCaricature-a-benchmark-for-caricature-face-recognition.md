##### Abstract
Caricatures are facial drawings by artists with exaggeration on certain facial parts. The exaggerations are often beyond realism and yet the caricatures are still recognizable by humans. With the advent of deep learning, recognition performances by computers on real-world faces has become comparable to human performance even under unconstrained situations. However, there is still a gap in caricature recognition performance between computer and human. This is mainly due to the lack of publicly available caricature datasets of large scale. To facilitate the research in caricature recognition, a new caricature dataset is built. All the caricature images and face images were collected from the web.Compared with two existing datasets, this dataset is of larger size and has various artistic styles. We also offer evaluation protocols and present baseline performances on the dataset. Specifically, four evaluation protocols are provided: restricted and unrestricted caricature verifications, caricature to photo and photo to caricature face identifications. Based on the evaluation protocols, three face alignment methods together with five kinds of features and nine subspace and metric learning algorithms have been applied to provide the baseline performances on this dataset. Main conclusion is that there is still a space for improvement in caricature face recognition.

##### Abstract (translated by Google)
漫画是艺术家在某些面部上夸张的面部绘画。夸张往往超越现实主义，但漫画仍然是人类可以识别的。随着深度学习的出现，计算机在现实世界中的表现与即使在不受限制的情况下也能与人类表现相媲美。但是，计算机与人的漫画识别性能仍然存在差距。这主要是由于缺乏大规模公开可用的漫画数据集。为了便于漫画识别的研究，构建了一个新的漫画数据集。所有的漫画图像和人脸图像都是从网上收集的。与现有的两个数据集相比，这个数据集体积较大，具有不同的艺术风格。我们还提供评估协议和数据集的当前基线性能。具体来说，提供了四个评估协议：漫画验证的限制和不受限制，漫画照片和漫画人脸识别照片。基于评估协议，已经应用了三种人脸对齐方法，五种特征和九种子空间和度量学习算法来提供该数据集的基线性能。主要结论是漫画人脸识别还有一定的改进空间。
