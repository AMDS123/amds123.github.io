##### Abstract
Residential location choice modeling is one of the substantial components of land use and transportation models. While numerous aggregated mathematical and statistical approaches have been developed to model the residence choice behavior of households, disaggregated approaches such as the agent-based modeling have shown interesting capabilities. In this article, a novel agent-based approach is developed to simulate the residential location choice of tenants in Tehran, the capital of Iran. Tenants are considered as agents who select their desired residential alternatives according to their characteristics and preferences for various criteria such as the rent, accessibility to different services and facilities, environmental pollution, and distance from their workplace and former residence. The choice set of agents is limited to their desired residential alternatives by applying a constrained NSGA-II algorithm. Then, agents compete with each other to select their final residence among their alternatives. Results of the proposed approach are validated by comparing simulated and actual residences of a sample of tenants. Results show that the proposed approach is able to accurately simulate the residence of 59.3% of tenants at the traffic analysis zone level.

住宅位置选择建模是土地使用和交通模型的重要组成部分之一。尽管已经开发了许多汇总的数学和统计方法来模拟住户的住宅选择行为，但基于代理的建模等分类方法已经显示出有趣的功能。在这篇文章中，开发了一种新的基于代理的方法来模拟伊朗首都德黑兰租户的住宅选址。租户被视为代理人，根据他们的特点和喜好选择他们想要的住宅替代方案，例如租金，不同服务和设施的可达性，环境污染以及与工作场所和故居的距离。通过应用受约束的NSGA-II算法，代理的选择集限于其期望的住宅选择。然后，代理商相互竞争，在他们的替代品中选择他们的最终居所。所提出的方法的结果通过比较租户样本的模拟住房和实际住宅来验证。结果表明，所提出的方法能够准确模拟59.3％的租户在交通分析区域的居住地。
