##### Abstract
With the recent renaissance of deep convolution neural networks, encouraging breakthroughs have been achieved on the supervised recognition tasks, where each class has sufficient training data and fully annotated training data. However, to scale the recognition to a large number of classes with few or now training samples for each class remains an unsolved problem. One approach to scaling up the recognition is to develop models capable of recognizing unseen categories without any training instances, or zero-shot recognition/ learning. This article provides a comprehensive review of existing zero-shot recognition techniques covering various aspects ranging from representations of models, and from datasets and evaluation settings. We also overview related recognition tasks including one-shot and open set recognition which can be used as natural extensions of zero-shot recognition when limited number of class samples become available or when zero-shot recognition is implemented in a real-world setting. Importantly, we highlight the limitations of existing approaches and point out future research directions in this existing new research area.

随着深度卷积神经网络的复兴，在监督识别任务方面取得了令人鼓舞的突破，每个类别都有充足的训练数据和充分注释的训练数据。然而，为了将每个类的很少或者现在的训练样本的识别扩展到大量的类别，仍然是一个未解决的问题。扩大认知的一种方法是开发能够在没有任何训练实例的情况下识别看不见的类别或零点识别/学习的模型。本文全面回顾了现有的零点识别技术，涵盖了从模型表示，数据集和评估设置等各个方面。我们还概述了相关的识别任务，包括一次性和开放式识别，当有限数量的类别样品可用时，或者在实际环境中执行零点识别时，可以用作自动扩展零点识别。重要的是，我们强调现有方法的局限性，并指出在这个现有的新研究领域的未来研究方向。
