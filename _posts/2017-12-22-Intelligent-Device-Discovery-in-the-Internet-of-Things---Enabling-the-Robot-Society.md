##### Abstract
The Internet of Things (IoT) is continuously growing to connect billions of smart devices anywhere and anytime in an Internet-like structure, which enables a variety of applications, services and interactions between human and objects. In the future, the smart devices are supposed to be able to autonomously discover a target device with desired features and generate a set of entirely new services and applications that are not supervised or even imagined by human beings. The pervasiveness of smart devices, as well as the heterogeneity of their design and functionalities, raise a major concern: How can a smart device efficiently discover a desired target device? In this paper, we propose a Social-Aware and Distributed (SAND) scheme that achieves a fast, scalable and efficient device discovery in the IoT. The proposed SAND scheme adopts a novel device ranking criteria that measures the device's degree, social relationship diversity, clustering coefficient and betweenness. Based on the device ranking criteria, the discovery request can be guided to travel through critical devices that stand at the major intersections of the network, and thus quickly reach the desired target device by contacting only a limited number of intermediate devices. With the help of such an intelligent device discovery as SAND, the IoT devices, as well as other computing facilities, software and data on the Internet, can autonomously establish new social connections with each other as human being do. They can formulate self-organized computing groups to perform required computing tasks, facilitate a fusion of a variety of computing service, network service and data to generate novel applications and services, evolve from the individual aritificial intelligence to the collaborative intelligence, and eventually enable the birth of a robot society.

##### Abstract (translated by Google)
物联网（IoT）不断发展，可以随时随地连接数十亿种类似于互联网的智能设备，从而实现人与物之间的各种应用，服务和交互。未来，智能设备应该能够自主发现具有所需特征的目标设备，并生成一套全新的服务和应用程序，这些服务和应用程序不受人类监督或者甚至是人类的想象。智能设备的普遍性以及设计和功能的异质性引起了一个主要的关注：智能设备如何有效地发现所需的目标设备？在本文中，我们提出了一种社交感知和分布式（SAND）方案，在IoT中实现了快速，可扩展和高效的设备发现。所提出的SAND方案采用了一种新颖的设备排名标准来衡量设备的程度，社会关系的多样性，聚类系数和介数。根据设备等级标准，可以引导发现请求通过站在网络主要交叉点的关键设备，因此只需联系有限数量的中间设备即可快速到达所需的目标设备。在SAND等智能设备发现的帮助下，物联网设备以及互联网上的其他计算设备，软件和数据可以自主地与人类建立起新的社交联系。他们可以制定自组织计算小组来执行所需的计算任务，促进各种计算服务，网络服务和数据的融合，以生成新颖的应用程序和服务，从个人智能发展到协同智能，最终实现机器人社会的诞生。
