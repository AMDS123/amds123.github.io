##### Abstract
We utilize machine learning models which are based on recurrent neural networks to optimize dynamical decoupling (DD) sequences. DD is a relatively simple technique for suppressing the errors in quantum memory for certain noise models. In numerical simulations, we show that with minimum use of prior knowledge and starting from random sequences, the models are able to improve over time and eventually output DD-sequences with performance better than that of the well known DD-families. Furthermore, our algorithm is easy to implement in experiments to find solutions tailored to the specific hardware, as it treats the figure of merit as a black box.

我们利用基于递归神经网络的机器学习模型来优化动态解耦（DD）序列。对于某些噪声模型，DD是一种相对简单的抑制量子存储器误差的技术。在数值模拟中，我们表明，用最少的先验知识和从随机序列开始，模型能够随着时间的推移而改进，并最终输出性能比众所周知的DD系列更好的DD序列。此外，我们的算法很容易在实验中实现，以找到适合特定硬件的解决方案，因为它将品质因数视为黑盒子。
