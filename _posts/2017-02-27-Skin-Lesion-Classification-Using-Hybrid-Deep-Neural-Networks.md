##### Abstract
Skin cancer is one of the major types of cancers and its incidence has been increasing over the past decades. Skin lesions can arise from various dermatologic disorders and can be classified to various types according to their texture, structure, color and other morphological features. The accuracy of diagnosis of skin lesions, specifically the discrimination of benign and malignant lesions, is paramount to ensure appropriate patient treatment. Machine learning-based classification approaches are among popular automatic methods for skin lesion classification. While there are many existing methods, convolutional neural networks (CNN) have shown to be superior over other classical machine learning methods for object detection and classification tasks. In this work, a fully automatic computerized method is proposed, which employs well established pre-trained convolutional neural networks and ensembles learning to classify skin lesions. We trained the networks using 2000 skin lesion images available from the ISIC 2017 challenge, which has three main categories and includes 374 melanoma, 254 seborrheic keratosis and 1372 benign nevi images. The trained classifier was then tested on 150 unlabeled images. The results, evaluated by the challenge organizer and based on the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), were 84.8% and 93.6% for Melanoma and seborrheic keratosis binary classification problem, respectively. The proposed method achieved competitive results to experienced dermatologist. Further improvement and optimization of the proposed method with a larger training dataset could lead to a more precise, reliable and robust method for skin lesion classification.

皮肤癌是癌症的主要类型之一，其发病率在过去几十年中一直在增加。皮肤损伤可以由各种皮肤病引起，根据其质地，结构，颜色和其他形态特征可以分类为各种类型。皮损诊断的准确性，特别是良性和恶性病变的鉴别对于确保适当的患者治疗是极为重要的。基于机器学习的分类方法是流行的皮肤病变分类的自动方法之一。虽然有许多现有的方法，但是卷积神经网络（CNN）已经显示出优于其他经典的用于对象检测和分类任务的机器学习方法。在这项工作中，提出了一种全自动的计算机化方法，它采用完善的预训练卷积神经网络和集合学习来分类皮肤损伤。我们使用“ISIC 2017挑战”中提供的2000个皮肤病变图像训练网络，其中有三个主要类别，包括374黑色素瘤，254脂溢性角化病和1372良性痣图像。然后在150个未标记的图像上测试训练的分类器。由挑战组织者根据受试者工作特征曲线下面积（AUC）评估的结果分别为黑色素瘤和脂溢性角化病二元分类问题的84.8％和93.6％。所提出的方法取得了有经验的皮肤科医生的竞争结果。用更大的训练数据集进一步改进和优化所提出的方法可以导致更精确，可靠和鲁棒的皮肤病灶分类方法。
