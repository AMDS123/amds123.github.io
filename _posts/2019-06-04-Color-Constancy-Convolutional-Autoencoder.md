##### Abstract
In this paper, we study the importance of pre-training for the generalization capability in the color constancy problem. We propose two novel approaches based on convolutional autoencoders: an unsupervised pre-training algorithm using a fine-tuned encoder and a semi-supervised pre-training algorithm using a novel composite-loss function. This enables us to solve the data scarcity problem and achieve competitive, to the state-of-the-art, results while requiring much fewer parameters on ColorChecker RECommended dataset. We further study the over-fitting phenomenon on the recently introduced version of INTEL-TUT Dataset for Camera Invariant Color Constancy Research, which has both field and non-field scenes acquired by three different camera models.
