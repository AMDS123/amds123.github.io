##### Abstract
LTE in unlicensed spectrum using licensed assisted access LTE (LTE-LAA) is a promising approach to overcome the wireless spectrum scarcity. However, to reap the benefits of LTE-LAA, a fair coexistence mechanism with other incumbent WiFi deployments is required. In this paper, a novel deep learning approach is proposed for modeling the resource allocation problem of LTE-LAA small base stations (SBSs). The proposed approach enables multiple SBSs to proactively perform dynamic channel selection, carrier aggregation, and fractional spectrum access while guaranteeing fairness with existing WiFi networks and other LTE-LAA operators. Adopting a proactive coexistence mechanism enables future delay-tolerant LTE-LAA data demands to be served within a given prediction window ahead of their actual arrival time thus avoiding the underutilization of the unlicensed spectrum during off-peak hours while maximizing the total served LTE-LAA traffic load. To this end, a noncooperative game model is formulated in which SBSs are modeled as Homo Egualis agents that aim at predicting a sequence of future actions and thus achieving long-term equal weighted fairness with WLAN and other LTE-LAA operators over a given time horizon. The proposed deep learning algorithm is then shown to reach a mixed-strategy Nash equilibrium (NE), when it converges. Simulation results using real data traces show that the proposed scheme can yield up to 28% and 11% gains over a conventional reactive approach and a proportional fair coexistence mechanism, respectively. The results also show that the proposed framework prevents WiFi performance degradation for a densely deployed LTE-LAA network.
