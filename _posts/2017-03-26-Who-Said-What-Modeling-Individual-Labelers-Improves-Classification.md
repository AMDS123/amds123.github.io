##### Abstract
Data are often labeled by many different experts with each expert only labeling a small fraction of the data and each data point being labeled by several experts. This reduces the workload on individual experts and also gives a better estimate of the unobserved ground truth. When experts disagree, the standard approaches are to treat the majority opinion as the correct label or to model the correct label as a distribution. These approaches, however, do not make any use of potentially valuable information about which expert produced which label. To make use of this extra information, we propose modeling the experts individually and then learning averaging weights for combining them, possibly in sample-specific ways. This allows us to give more weight to more reliable experts and take advantage of the unique strengths of individual experts at classifying certain types of data. Here we show that our approach leads to improvements in computer-aided diagnosis of diabetic retinopathy. We also show that our method performs better than competing algorithms by Welinder and Perona, and by Mnih and Hinton. Our work offers an innovative approach for dealing with the myriad real-world settings that use expert opinions to define labels for training.

数据通常由许多不同的专家标记，每个专家只标记一小部分数据，每个数据点由几位专家标记。这减少了个别专家的工作量，也更好地估计了未被发现的事实。当专家不同意时，标准方法是将多数意见作为正确的标签或将正确的标签作为分布进行建模。但是，这些方法不会使用关于哪个专家生成哪个标签的潜在有价值的信息。为了利用这些额外的信息，我们建议单独建模专家，然后学习平均权重来合并它们，可能以样本特定的方式。这使我们能够更加重视更可靠的专家，并利用个别专家在分类某些类型数据时的独特优势。在这里我们表明，我们的方法导致糖尿病视网膜病变的计算机辅助诊断的改善。我们还表明，我们的方法比Welinder和Perona以及Mnih和Hinton的竞争算法更好。我们的工作提供了一种创新方法来处理使用专家意见来定义培训标签的无数现实环境设置。
