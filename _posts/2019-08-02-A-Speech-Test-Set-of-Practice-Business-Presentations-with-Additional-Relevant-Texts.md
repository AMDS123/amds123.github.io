##### Abstract
We present a test corpus of audio recordings and transcriptions of presentations of students' enterprises together with their slides and web-pages. The corpus is intended for evaluation of automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems, especially in conditions where the prior availability of in-domain vocabulary and named entities is benefitable. The corpus consists of 39 presentations in English, each up to 90 seconds long. The speakers are high school students from European countries with English as their second language. We benchmark three baseline ASR systems on the corpus and show their imperfection.
