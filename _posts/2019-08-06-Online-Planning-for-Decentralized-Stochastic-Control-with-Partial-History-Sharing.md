##### Abstract
In decentralized stochastic control, standard approaches for sequential decision-making, e.g. dynamic programming, quickly become intractable due to the need to maintain a complex information state. Computational challenges are further compounded if agents do not possess complete model knowledge. In this paper, we take advantage of the fact that in many problems agents share some common information, or history, termed partial history sharing. Under this information structure the policy search space is greatly reduced. We propose a provably convergent, online tree-search based algorithm that does not require a closed-form model or explicit communication among agents. Interestingly, our algorithm can be viewed as a generalization of several existing heuristic solvers for decentralized partially observable Markov decision processes. To demonstrate the applicability of the model, we propose a novel collaborative intrusion response model, where multiple agents (defenders) possessing asymmetric information aim to collaboratively defend a computer network. Numerical results demonstrate the performance of our algorithm.
