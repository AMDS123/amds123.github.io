##### Abstract
The worldwide growth of maritime traffic and the development of the Automatic Identification System (AIS) has led to advances in monitoring systems for preventing vessel accidents and detecting illegal activities. In this work, we describe research gaps and challenges in machine learning for vessel behavior change and event detection, considering several constraints imposed by real-time data streams and the maritime monitoring domain. As a starting point, we investigate how unsupervised and semi-supervised change detection methods may be employed for identifying shifts in vessel behavior, aiming to detect and label unusual events.
