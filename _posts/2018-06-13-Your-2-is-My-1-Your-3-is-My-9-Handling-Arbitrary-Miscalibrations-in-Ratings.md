##### Abstract
Cardinal scores (numeric ratings) collected from people are well known to suffer from miscalibrations. A popular approach to address this issue is to assume simplistic models of miscalibration (such as linear biases) to de-bias the scores. This approach, however, often fares poorly because people's miscalibrations are typically far more complex and not well understood. In the absence of simplifying assumptions on the miscalibration, it is widely believed that the only useful information in the cardinal scores is the induced ranking. In this paper, inspired by the framework of Stein's shrinkage and empirical Bayes, we contest this widespread belief. Specifically, we consider cardinal scores with arbitrary (or even adversarially chosen) miscalibrations that is only required to be consistent with the induced ranking. We design estimators that despite making no assumptions on the miscalibration, surprisingly, strictly and uniformly outperform all possible estimators that rely on only the ranking. Our estimators are flexible in that they can be used as a plug-in for a variety of applications. Our results thus provide novel insights in the eternal debate between cardinal and ordinal data.

##### Abstract (translated by Google)
众所周知，从人们收集到的主要分数（数字评分）会由于误差而受到影响。解决这个问题的一种流行方法是假设简单化的错误校准模型（如线性偏差）去偏差分数。然而，这种方法往往表现不佳，因为人们的误差通常要复杂得多，而且不易理解。在缺乏对错误校准的简化假设的情况下，人们普遍认为，基数得分中唯一有用的信息是诱导排名。在本文中，受斯坦因收缩和经验贝叶斯框架的启发，我们对这种普遍的观点进行了争辩。具体而言，我们认为主观分数与任意（甚至是对手选择的）误差只需要与诱导排名相一致。我们设计的估计器尽管没有对失衡进行假设，但令人惊讶的是，它严格而一致地胜过了仅依赖于排名的所有可能的估计量。我们的估算器非常灵活，因为它们可以用作各种应用程序的插件。因此，我们的研究结果为主要数据和有序数据之间的永恒争论提供了新的见解。
