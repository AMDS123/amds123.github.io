##### Abstract
One of the emerging trends for sports analytics is the growing use of player and ball tracking data. A parallel development is deep learning predictive approaches that use vast quantities of data with less reliance on feature engineering. This paper applies recurrent neural networks in the form of sequence modeling to predict whether a three-point shot is successful. The models are capable of learning the trajectory of a basketball without any knowledge of physics. For comparison, a baseline static machine learning model with a full set of features, such as angle and velocity, in addition to the positional data is also tested. Using a dataset of over 20,000 three pointers from NBA SportVu data, the models based simply on sequential positional data outperform a static feature rich machine learning model in predicting whether a three-point shot is successful. This suggests deep learning models may offer an improvement to traditional feature based machine learning methods for tracking data.

运动分析的新兴趋势之一是越来越多地使用球员和球跟踪数据。一个并行的发展是深度学习预测方法，使用大量的数据，对特征工程的依赖较少。本文以序列模型的形式应用递归神经网络来预测三点射击是否成功。这些模型能够在没有任何物理知识的情况下学习篮球的运动轨迹。为了比较，除了位置数据之外，还测试了具有全部特征（例如角度和速度）的基线静态机器学习模型。使用来自NBA SportVu数据的超过两万个三分球的数据集，仅基于顺序位置数据的模型在静态特征丰富的机器学习模型中胜过预测三分球是否成功。这表明深度学习模型可能会改进传统的基于特征的机器学习方法来跟踪数据。
