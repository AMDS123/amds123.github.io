##### Abstract
For speech research, ultrasound tongue imaging provides a non-invasive means for visualizing tongue position and movement during articulation. Extracting tongue contours from ultrasound images is a basic step in analyzing ultrasound data but this task often requires non-trivial manual annotation. This study presents an open source tool for fully automatic tracking of tongue contours in ultrasound frames using neural network based methods. We have implemented and systematically compared two convolutional neural networks, U-Net and DenseU-Net, under different conditions. Though both models can perform automatic contour tracking with comparable accuracy, Dense U-Net architecture seems more generalizable across test datasets while U-Net has faster extraction speed. Our comparison also shows that the choice of loss function and data augmentation have a greater effect on tracking performance in this task. This public available segmentation tool shows considerable promise for the automated tongue contour annotation of ultrasound images in speech research.
