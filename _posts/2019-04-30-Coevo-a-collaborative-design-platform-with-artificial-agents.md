##### Abstract
We present Coevo, an online platform that allows both humans and artificial agents to design shapes that solve different tasks. Our goal is to explore common shared design tools that can be used by humans and artificial agents in a context of creation. This approach can provide a better knowledge transfer and interaction with artificial agents since a common language of design is defined. In this paper, we outline the main components of this platform and discuss the definition of a human-centered language to enhance human-AI collaboration in co-creation scenarios.
