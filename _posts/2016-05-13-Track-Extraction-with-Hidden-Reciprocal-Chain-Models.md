##### Abstract
This paper develops Bayesian track extraction algorithms for targets modelled as hidden reciprocal chains (HRC). HRC are a class of finite-state random process models that generalise the familiar hidden Markov chains (HMC). HRC are able to model the "intention" of a target to proceed from a given origin to a destination, behaviour which cannot be properly captured by a HMC. While Bayesian estimation problems for HRC have previously been studied, this paper focusses principally on the problem of track extraction, of which the primary task is confirming target existence in a set of detections obtained from thresholding sensor measurements. Simulation examples are presented which show that the additional model information contained in a HRC improves detection performance when compared to HMC models.

##### Abstract (translated by Google)
本文开发了针对隐藏互惠链（HRC）的贝叶斯目标提取算法。 HRC是一类有限状态随机过程模型，它概括了熟悉的隐马尔可夫链（HMC）。 HRC能够模拟一个目标的“意图”，从一个给定的起点到一个目的地，一个HMC无法适当捕捉的行为。虽然之前已经研究了HRC的贝叶斯估计问题，但是本文主要集中在轨道提取问题上，其主要任务是确定从阈值传感器测量获得的一组检测中的目标存在。提出的仿真实例表明，与HMC模型相比，HRC中包含的附加模型信息提高了检测性能。
