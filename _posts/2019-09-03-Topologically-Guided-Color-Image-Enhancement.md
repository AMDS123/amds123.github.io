##### Abstract
Enhancement is an important step in post-processing digital images for personal use, in medical imaging, and for object recognition. Most existing manual techniques rely on region selection, similarity, and/or thresholding for editing, never really considering the topological structure of the image. In this paper, we leverage the contour tree to extract a hierarchical representation of the topology of an image. We propose 4 topology-aware transfer functions for editing features of the image using local topological properties, instead of global image properties. Finally, we evaluate our approach with grayscale and color images.
