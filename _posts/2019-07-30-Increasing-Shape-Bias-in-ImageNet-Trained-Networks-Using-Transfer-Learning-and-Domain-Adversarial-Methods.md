##### Abstract
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have become the state-of-the-art method to learn from image data. However, recent research shows that they may include a texture and colour bias in their representation, contrary to the intuition that they learn the shapes of the image content and to human biological learning. Thus, recent works have attempted to increase the shape bias in CNNs in order to train more robust and accurate networks on tasks. One such approach uses style-transfer in order to remove texture clues from the data. This work reproduces this methodology on four image classification datasets, as well as extends the method to use domain-adversarial training in order to further increase the shape bias in the learned representation. The results show the proposed method increases the robustness and shape bias of the CNNs, while it does not provide a gain in accuracy.
