##### Abstract
In this paper we present a new regularization term for variational image restoration which can be regarded as a space-variant anisotropic extension of the classical isotropic Total Variation (TV) regularizer. The proposed regularizer comes from the statistical assumption that the gradients of the target image distribute locally according to space-variant bivariate Laplacian distributions. The highly flexible variational structure of the corresponding regularizer encodes several free parameters which hold the potential for faithfully modelling the local geometry in the image and describing local orientation preferences. For an automatic estimation of such parameters, we design a robust maximum likelihood approach and report results on its reliability on synthetic data and natural images. A minimization algorithm based on the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) is presented for the efficient numerical solution of the proposed variational model. Some experimental results are reported which demonstrate the high-quality of restorations achievable by the proposed model, in particular with respect to classical Total Variation regularization.
