##### Abstract
One of the objectives of understanding pedestrian behavior is to predict the effect of proposed changes in the design or evaluation of pedestrian facilities. We want to know the impact to the user of the facilities, as the design of the facilities change. That impact was traditionally evaluated by level of service standards. Another design criterion to measure the impact of design change is measured by the pedestrian flow performance index. This paper describes the determination of pedestrian flow performance based video tracking or any microscopic pedestrian simulation models. Most of pedestrian researches have been done on a macroscopic level, which is an aggregation of all pedestrian movement in pedestrian areas into flow, average speed and area module. Macroscopic level, however, does not consider the interaction between pedestrians. It is also not well suited for prediction of pedestrian flow performance in pedestrian areas or in buildings with some obstruction, that reduces the effective width of the walkways. On the other hand, the microscopic level has a more general usage and considers detail in the design. More efficient pedestrian flow can even be reached with less space. Those results have rejected the linearity assumption of space and flow in the macroscopic level.

了解行人行为的目的之一是预测行人设施设计或评估中提出的变化的影响。我们想知道设施的设计变化对设施使用者的影响。传统上，这种影响是通过服务水平来评估的。衡量设计变更影响的另一个设计标准是通过行人流量性能指标来衡量的。本文描述了基于视频跟踪或任何微观行人模拟模型的人流性能的确定。大部分的行人研究都是在宏观层面上进行的，这是将行人区域内所有行人运动整合为流量，平均速度和面积的模块。而宏观层面则不考虑行人之间的相互作用。它也不适用于预测行人区域或有阻塞的建筑物的行人流量性能，从而减少人行道的有效宽度。另一方面，微观层面有更多的一般用法，并在设计中考虑细节。甚至可以用更少的空间达到更高效的人流。这些结果在宏观层面上拒绝了空间和流动的线性假设。
