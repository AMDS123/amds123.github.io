##### Abstract
The autonomous car technology promises to replace human drivers with safer driving systems. But although autonomous cars can become safer than human drivers this is a long process that is going to be refined over time. Before these vehicles are deployed on urban roads a minimum safety level must be assured. Since the autonomous car technology is still under development there is no standard methodology to evaluate such systems. It is important to completely understand the technology that is being developed to design efficient means to evaluate it. In this paper we assume safety-critical systems reliability as a safety measure. We model an autonomous road vehicle as an intelligent agent and we approach its evaluation from an artificial intelligence perspective. Our focus is the evaluation of perception and decision making systems and also to propose a systematic method to evaluate their integration in the vehicle. We identify critical aspects of the data dependency from the artificial intelligence state of the art models and we also propose procedures to reproduce them.

自动驾驶汽车技术有望用更安全的驾驶系统取代人的驾驶员。但是，尽管自动驾驶汽车可以比人类驾驶更安全，但这是一个漫长的过程，随着时间的推移将会不断完善。在这些车辆部署在城市道路上之前，必须确保最低的安全等级。由于自主汽车技术仍处于开发阶段，因此没有标准的方法来评估此类系统。完全理解正在开发的技术来设计评估它的有效手段非常重要。在本文中，我们假定安全关键系统的可靠性作为安全措施。我们将自主道路车辆建模为智能代理，并从人工智能角度对其进行评估。我们的重点是感知和决策制定系统的评估，并提出一个系统的方法来评估他们在车辆中的整合。我们从人工智能状态的艺术模型中确定数据依赖性的关键方面，并且我们还提出了重现它们的程序。
