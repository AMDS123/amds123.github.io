##### Abstract
We present a new algorithm for finding compact neural networks encoding reinforcement learning (RL) policies. To do it, we leverage in the novel RL setting the theory of pointer networks and ENAS-type algorithms for combinatorial optimization of RL policies as well as recent evolution strategies (ES) optimization methods, and propose to define the combinatorial search space to be the the set of different edge-partitionings (colorings) into same-weight classes. For several RL tasks, we manage to learn colorings translating to effective policies parameterized by as few as 17 weight parameters, providing 6x compression over state-of-the-art compact policies based on Toeplitz matrices. We believe that our work is one of the first attempts to propose a rigorous approach to training structured neural network architectures for RL problems that are of interest especially in mobile robotics with limited storage and computational resources.
