##### Abstract
Voice impersonation is not the same as voice transformation, although the latter is an essential element of it. In voice impersonation, the resultant voice must convincingly convey the impression of having been naturally produced by the target speaker, mimicking not only the pitch and other perceivable signal qualities, but also the style of the target speaker. In this paper, we propose a novel neural network based speech quality- and style- mimicry framework for the synthesis of impersonated voices. The framework is built upon a fast and accurate generative adversarial network model. Given spectrographic representations of source and target speakers' voices, the model learns to mimic the target speaker's voice quality and style, regardless of the linguistic content of either's voice, generating a synthetic spectrogram from which the time domain signal is reconstructed using the Griffin-Lim method. In effect, this model reframes the well-known problem of style-transfer for images as the problem of style-transfer for speech signals, while intrinsically addressing the problem of durational variability of speech sounds. Experiments demonstrate that the model can generate extremely convincing samples of impersonated speech. It is even able to impersonate voices across different genders effectively. Results are qualitatively evaluated using standard procedures for evaluating synthesized voices.

语音模仿不同于语音转换，尽管后者是它的基本要素。在声音模仿中，所产生的声音必须令人信服地传达目标讲话者自然产生的印象，不仅模仿音高和其他可感知的信号品质，还模仿目标讲话者的风格。在本文中，我们提出了一种新的基于神经网络的语音质量和风格模仿框架，用于合成模仿声音。该框架建立在快速，准确的生成对抗网络模型之上。给定声源和目标说话人语音的光谱表示，该模型学习模拟目标说话人的语音质量和风格，而不考虑语言的语言内容，生成合成语谱图，使用Griffin-Lim重构时域信号方法。实际上，这个模型重构了众所周知的图像风格转移问题，作为语音信号风格转移的问题，同时本质上解决了语音声音持续变化的问题。实验表明，该模型可以生成极具说服力的模仿语音样本。它甚至能够有效地模仿不同性别的声音。使用评估合成声音的标准程序对结果进行定性评估。
