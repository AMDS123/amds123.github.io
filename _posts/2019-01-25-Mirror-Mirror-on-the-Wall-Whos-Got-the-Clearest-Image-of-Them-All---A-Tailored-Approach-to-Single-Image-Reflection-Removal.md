##### Abstract
Removing reflection artefacts from a single image is a problem of both theoretical and practical interest, which still presents challenges because of the massively ill-posed nature of the problem. In this work, we propose a technique based on a novel optimisation problem. Firstly, we introduce a simple user interaction scheme, which helps minimise information loss in reflection-free regions. Secondly, we introduce an $H^2$ fidelity term, which preserves fine detail while enforcing global colour similarity. We show that this combination allows us to mitigate some major drawbacks of the existing methods for reflection removal. We demonstrate, through numerical and visual experiments, that our method is able to outperform the state-of-the-art methods and compete with recent deep-learning approaches.
