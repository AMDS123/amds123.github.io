##### Abstract
In the last several years, remote sensing technology has opened up the possibility of performing large scale building detection from satellite imagery. Our work is some of the first to create population density maps from building detection on a large scale. The scale of our work on population density estimation via high resolution satellite images raises many issues, that we will address in this paper. The first was data acquisition. Labeling buildings from satellite images is a hard problem, one where we found our labelers to only be about 85% accurate at. There is a tradeoff of quantity vs. quality of labels, so we designed two separate policies for labels meant for training sets and those meant for test sets, since our requirements of the two set types are quite different. We also trained weakly supervised footprint detection models with the classification labels, and semi-supervised approaches with a small number of pixel-level labels, which are very expensive to procure.

近几年来，遥感技术开辟了从卫星影像进行大规模建筑物检测的可能性。我们的工作是首先从大规模建筑物检测中创建人口密度地图。我们通过高分辨率卫星图像估算人口密度的工作规模引起了很多问题，我们将在本文中讨论。首先是数据采集。从卫星图像标注建筑物是一个难题，我们发现我们的贴标机只有85％的精确度。标签的质量和质量有一个权衡，所以我们设计了两套单独的策略，用于训练集和那些用于测试集的标签，因为我们对两套版本的要求是完全不同的。我们还用分类标签训练弱监督的足迹检测模型，用少量像素级标签进行半监督的方法，这些方法的采购非常昂贵。
