##### Abstract
Dynamic texture is a field of research that has gained considerable interest from computer vision community due to the explosive growth of multimedia databases. In addition, dynamic texture is present in a wide range of videos, which makes it very important in expert systems based on videos such as medical systems, traffic monitoring systems, forest fire detection system, among others. In this paper, a new method for dynamic texture characterization based on diffusion in directed networks is proposed. The dynamic texture is modeled as a directed network. The method consists in the analysis of the dynamic of this network after a series of graph cut transformations based on the edge weights. For each network transformation, the activity for each vertex is estimated. The activity is the relative frequency that one vertex is visited by random walks in balance. Then, texture descriptor is constructed by concatenating the activity histograms. The main contributions of this paper are the use of directed network modeling and diffusion in network to dynamic texture characterization. These tend to provide better performance in dynamic textures classification. Experiments with rotation and interference of the motion pattern were conducted in order to demonstrate the robustness of the method. The proposed approach is compared to other dynamic texture methods on two very well know dynamic texture database and on traffic condition classification, and outperform in most of the cases.

由于多媒体数据库的爆炸性增长，动态纹理是一个由计算机视觉领域引起广泛关注的研究领域。此外，动态纹理存在于各种视频中，这使得它在基于视频的专家系统（如医疗系统，交通监控系统，森林火灾探测系统等）中非常重要。本文提出了一种基于有向网络扩散的动态纹理特征表征方法。动态纹理被建模为定向网络。该方法包括在基于边权重的一系列图切换变换之后分析该网络的动态。对于每个网络转换，估计每个顶点的活动。活动是一个顶点被随机游走的相对频率。然后，通过连接活动直方图来构造纹理描述符。本文的主要贡献是使用有向网络建模和网络扩散来动态纹理表征。这些倾向于在动态纹理分类中提供更好的性能。为了证明该方法的鲁棒性，进行了运动模式的旋转和干涉实验。所提出的方法与其他动态纹理方法在两个非常熟悉的动态纹理数据库和交通状况分类上进行比较，并且在大多数情况下表现优于其他方法。
