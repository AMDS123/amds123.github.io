##### Abstract
Many current methods to interpret convolutional neural networks (CNNs) use visualization techniques and words to highlight concepts of the input seemingly relevant to a CNN's decision. The methods hypothesize that the recognition of these concepts are instrumental in the decision a CNN reaches, but the nature of this relationship has not been well explored. To address this gap, this paper examines the quality of a concept's recognition by a CNN and the degree to which the recognitions are associated with CNN decisions. The study considers a CNN trained for scene recognition over the ADE20k dataset. It uses a novel approach to find and score the strength of minimally distributed representations of input concepts (defined by objects in scene images) across late stage feature maps. Subsequent analysis finds evidence that concept recognition impacts decision making. Strong recognition of concepts frequently-occurring in few scenes are indicative of correct decisions, but recognizing concepts common to many scenes may mislead the network.

目前许多解释卷积神经网络（CNN）的方法都是使用可视化技术和单词来突出表达与CNN决策有关的输入概念。这些方法假设这些概念的承认是有助于CNN的决定，但这种关系的性质尚未得到很好的探索。为了弥补这一差距，本文考察了有线电视新闻网（CNN）对一个概念的认知质量，以及与CNN决策相关的认可程度。该研究考虑了在ADE20k数据集上进行场景识别训练的CNN。它使用一种新颖的方法来查找和评分晚期阶段特征地图中输入概念（由场景图像中的对象定义）的最小分布表示的强度。随后的分析发现证据表明概念识别影响决策。对少数场景中经常出现的概念的强烈认识表明了正确的决定，但是认识许多场景中常见的概念可能会误导网络。
