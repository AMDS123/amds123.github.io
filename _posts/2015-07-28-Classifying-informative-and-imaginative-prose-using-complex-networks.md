##### Abstract
Statistical methods have been widely employed in recent years to grasp many language properties. The application of such techniques have allowed an improvement of several linguistic applications, which encompasses machine translation, automatic summarization and document classification. In the latter, many approaches have emphasized the semantical content of texts, as it is the case of bag-of-word language models. This approach has certainly yielded reasonable performance. However, some potential features such as the structural organization of texts have been used only on a few studies. In this context, we probe how features derived from textual structure analysis can be effectively employed in a classification task. More specifically, we performed a supervised classification aiming at discriminating informative from imaginative documents. Using a networked model that describes the local topological/dynamical properties of function words, we achieved an accuracy rate of up to 95%, which is much higher than similar networked approaches. A systematic analysis of feature relevance revealed that symmetry and accessibility measurements are among the most prominent network measurements. Our results suggest that these measurements could be used in related language applications, as they play a complementary role in characterizing texts.

近年来，统计方法被广泛应用于掌握许多语言属性。这些技术的应用已经允许改进几种语言应用，包括机器翻译，自动汇总和文档分类。在后者中，许多方法都强调了文本的语义内容，因为它是包装盒语言模型的情况。这种做法当然取得了合理的成绩。然而，一些潜在的特征，如文本的结构组织已经被用于少数研究。在这个背景下，我们探讨如何在分类任务中有效地利用文本结构分析得出的特征。更具体地说，我们进行了监督分类，旨在从富有想象力的文件中识别信息。使用描述函数词的局部拓扑/动态特性的网络模型，我们实现了高达95％的准确率，这远远高于类似的网络方法。特征相关性的系统分析揭示了对称性和可达性测量是最显着的网络测量。我们的研究结果表明，这些测量可以用于相关的语言应用，因为它们在表征文本中起到补充作用。
