##### Abstract
Many effective supervised discriminative dictionary learning methods have been developed in the literature. However, when training these algorithms, precise ground-truth of the training data is required to provide very accurate point-wise labels. Yet, in many applications, accurate labels are not always feasible. This is especially true in the case of buried object detection in which the size of the objects are not consistent. In this paper, a new multiple instance dictionary learning algorithm for detecting buried objects using a handheld WEMI sensor is detailed. The new algorithm, Task Driven Extended Functions of Multiple Instances, can overcome data that does not have very precise point-wise labels and still learn a highly discriminative dictionary. Results are presented and discussed on measured WEMI data.

文献中已经开发了许多有效的监督鉴别字典学习方法。但是，在训练这些算法时，需要精确的训练数据的基础真实性来提供非常精确的点式标签。然而，在许多应用中，准确的标签并不总是可行的。对于物体尺寸不一致的埋地物体检测来说尤其如此。本文详细介绍了一种利用手持式WEMI传感器检测埋地物体的多实例字典学习算法。新的算法，任务驱动扩展多个实例的功能，可以克服没有非常精确的点明智标签的数据，仍然学习高判别力的字典。结果在测量的WEMI数据上呈现并讨论。
