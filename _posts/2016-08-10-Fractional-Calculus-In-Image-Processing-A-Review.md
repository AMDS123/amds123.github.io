##### Abstract
Over the last decade, it has been demonstrated that many systems in science and engineering can be modeled more accurately by fractional-order than integer-order derivatives, and many methods are developed to solve the problem of fractional systems. Due to the extra free parameter order, fractional-order based methods provide additional degree of freedom in optimization performance. Not surprisingly, many fractional-order based methods have been used in image processing field. Herein recent studies are reviewed in ten sub-fields, which include image enhancement, image denoising, image edge detection, image segmentation, image registration, image recognition, image fusion, image encryption, image compression and image restoration. In sum, it is well proved that as a fundamental mathematic tool, fractional-order derivative shows great success in image processing.

在过去的十年中，已经证明许多科学和工程系统可以通过分数阶比准整数阶导数更精确地建模，并且发展了很多方法来解决分数系统的问题。由于额外的自由参数顺序，基于分数阶的方法为优化性能提供了额外的自由度。毫不奇怪，许多基于分数阶的方法已被用于图像处理领域。本文对图像增强，图像去噪，图像边缘检测，图像分割，图像配准，图像识别，图像融合，图像加密，图像压缩和图像恢复等十个子领域进行了综述。综上所述，作为一个基本的数学工具，分数阶导数在图像处理方面取得了巨大的成功。
