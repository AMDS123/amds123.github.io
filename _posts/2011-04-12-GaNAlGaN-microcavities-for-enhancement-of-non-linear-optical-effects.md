##### Abstract
We present a study on the design, growth and optical characterization of a GaN/AlGaN microcavity for the enhancement of second order non linear effects. The proposed system exploits the high second order nonlinear optical response of GaN due to the non centrosymmetric crystalline structure of this material. It consists of a GaN cavity embedded between two GaN/AlGaN Distributed Bragg Reflectors designed for a reference mode coincident with a second harmonic field generated in the near UV region (~ 400 nm). Critical issues for this target are the crystalline quality of the material, together with sharp and abrupt interfaces among the multi-stacked layers. A detailed investigation on the growth evolution of GaN and AlGaN epilayers in such a configuration is reported, with the aim to obtain high quality factor in the desiderated spectral range. Non linear second harmonic generation experiments have been performed and the results were compared with bulk GaN sample, highlighting the effect of the microcavity on the non linear optical response of this material.
