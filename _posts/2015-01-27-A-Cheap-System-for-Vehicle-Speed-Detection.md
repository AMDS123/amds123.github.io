##### Abstract
The reliable detection of speed of moving vehicles is considered key to traffic law enforcement in most countries, and is seen by many as an important tool to reduce the number of traffic accidents and fatalities. Many automatic systems and different methods are employed in different countries, but as a rule they tend to be expensive and/or labor intensive, often employing outdated technology due to the long development time. Here we describe a speed detection system that relies on simple everyday equipment - a laptop and a consumer web camera. Our method is based on tracking the license plates of cars, which gives the relative movement of the cars in the image. This image displacement is translated to actual motion by using the method of projection to a reference plane, where the reference plane is the road itself. However, since license plates do not touch the road, we must compensate for the entailed distortion in speed measurement. We show how to compute the compensation factor using knowledge of the license plate standard dimensions. Consequently our system computes the true speed of moving vehicles fast and accurately. We show promising results on videos obtained in a number of scenes and with different car models.

运动车辆速度的可靠检测被认为是大多数国家交通执法的关键，被许多人视为减少交通事故和死亡人数的重要手段。许多自动化系统和不同的方法在不同的国家使用，但是通常它们往往是昂贵的和/或劳动密集型的，由于开发时间长，往往采用过时的技术。这里我们介绍一种依靠简单的日常设备（笔记本电脑和消费者网络摄像头）的速度检测系统。我们的方法是基于跟踪汽车的牌照，从而给出汽车在图像中的相对运动。通过使用投影到参考平面的方法将该图像位移转化为实际运动，其中参考平面是道路本身。但是，由于牌照不与路面接触，我们必须对速度测量中的失真进行补偿。我们展示如何使用牌照标准尺寸的知识来计算补偿因子。因此，我们的系统快速准确地计算出车辆的真实速度。我们展示了在许多场景和不同车型获得的视频有希望的结果。
