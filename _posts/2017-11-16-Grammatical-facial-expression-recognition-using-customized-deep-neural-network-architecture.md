##### Abstract
This paper proposes to expand the visual understanding capacity of computers by helping it recognize human sign language more efficiently. This is carried out through recognition of facial expressions, which accompany the hand signs used in this language. This paper specially focuses on the popular Brazilian sign language (LIBRAS). While classifying different hand signs into their respective word meanings has already seen much literature dedicated to it, the emotions or intention with which the words are expressed haven't primarily been taken into consideration. As from our normal human experience, words expressed with different emotions or mood can have completely different meanings attached to it. Lending computers the ability of classifying these facial expressions, can help add another level of deep understanding of what the deaf person exactly wants to communicate. The proposed idea is implemented through a deep neural network having a customized architecture. This helps learning specific patterns in individual expressions much better as compared to a generic approach. With an overall accuracy of 98.04%, the implemented deep network performs excellently well and thus is fit to be used in any given practical scenario.

本文提出了通过更有效地识别人类手语来扩展计算机的视觉理解能力。这是通过识别与这种语言中使用的手势相伴的面部表情来进行的。本文特别关注流行的巴西手语（LIBRAS）。虽然将不同的手势分类到各自的词义上已经看到许多文献，但表达的情感或意图主要没有被考虑。从我们正常的人类经验来看，用不同的情绪或情绪表达的话可以有完全不同的含义。借助计算机对这些面部表情进行分类的能力，可以帮助人们更深入地了解聋哑人想要沟通的内容。所提出的想法是通过具有定制架构的深度神经网络来实现的。与通用方法相比，这有助于更好地学习单个表达式中的特定模式。总体准确率为98.04％，所实现的深层网络性能良好，适用于任何实际情况。
