##### Abstract
Quantitative analysis of the dynamics of tiny cellular and sub-cellular structures, known as particles, in time-lapse cell microscopy sequences requires the development of a reliable multi-target tracking method capable of tracking numerous similar targets in the presence of high levels of noise, high target density, complex motion patterns and intricate interactions. In this paper, we propose a framework for tracking these structures based on the random finite set Bayesian filtering framework. We focus on challenging biological applications where image characteristics such as noise and background intensity change during the acquisition process. Under these conditions, detection methods usually fail to detect all particles and are often followed by missed detections and many spurious measurements with unknown and time-varying rates. To deal with this, we propose a bootstrap filter composed of an estimator and a tracker. The estimator adaptively estimates the required meta parameters for the tracker such as clutter rate and the detection probability of the targets, while the tracker estimates the state of the targets. Our results show that the proposed approach can outperform state-of-the-art particle trackers on both synthetic and real data in this regime.

定时分析细胞和亚细胞结构（称为颗粒）在时间推移细胞显微镜序列中的动力学需要开发可靠的多目标跟踪方法，能够在存在高水平噪声的情况下跟踪许多类似的目标，目标密度高，运动模式复杂，交互复杂。在本文中，我们提出了一个基于随机有限集贝叶斯过滤框架来跟踪这些结构的框架。我们专注于挑战在采集过程中噪声和背景强度等图像特征发生变化的生物学应用。在这些条件下，检测方法通常不能检测到所有的粒子，往往是错过检测和许多具有未知和随时间变化的虚假测量。为了解决这个问题，我们提出了一个由估计器和跟踪器组成的bootstrap滤波器。估计器自适应地估计跟踪器所需的元参数，例如杂波率和目标的检测概率，而跟踪器估计目标的状态。我们的研究结果表明，这种方法可以在综合数据和真实数据上超越最先进的粒子追踪器。
