##### Abstract
We report on the impact of growth conditions on surface hillock density of N-polar GaN grown on nominally on-axis (0001) sapphire substrate by metal organic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD). Large reduction in hillock density was achieved by implementation of an optimized high temperature AlN nucleation layer and use of indium surfactant in GaN overgrowth. A reduction by more than a factor of five in hillock density from 1000 to 170 hillocks/cm$^{-2}$ was achieved as a result. Crystal quality and surface morphology of the resultant GaN films were characterized by high resolution x-ray diffraction and atomic force microscopy and found to be relatively unaffected by the buffer conditions. It is also shown that the density of smaller surface features is unaffected by AlN buffer conditions.

##### Abstract (translated by Google)
我们通过金属有机化学气相沉积（MOCVD）报告了生长条件对名义上在轴（0001）蓝宝石衬底上生长的N极GaN的表面小丘密度的影响。通过实施优化的高温AlN成核层和在GaN过度生长中使用铟表面活性剂实现了小丘密度的大幅降低。因此，实现了从小到大的小丘密度从1000降至170小时的五倍以上。所得GaN膜的晶体质量和表面形态通过高分辨率X射线衍射和原子力显微镜表征，并发现相对不受缓冲条件的影响。还表明，较小的表面特征的密度不受AlN缓冲条件的影响。
