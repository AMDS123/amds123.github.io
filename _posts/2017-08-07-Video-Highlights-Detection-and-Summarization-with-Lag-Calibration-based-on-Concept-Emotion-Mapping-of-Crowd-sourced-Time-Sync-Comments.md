##### Abstract
With the prevalence of video sharing, there are increasing demands for automatic video digestion such as highlight detection. Recently, platforms with crowdsourced time-sync video comments have emerged worldwide, providing a good opportunity for highlight detection. However, this task is non-trivial: (1) time-sync comments often lag behind their corresponding shot; (2) time-sync comments are semantically sparse and noisy; (3) to determine which shots are highlights is highly subjective. The present paper aims to tackle these challenges by proposing a framework that (1) uses concept-mapped lexical-chains for lag calibration; (2) models video highlights based on comment intensity and combination of emotion and concept concentration of each shot; (3) summarize each detected highlight using improved SumBasic with emotion and concept mapping. Experiments on large real-world datasets show that our highlight detection method and summarization method both outperform other benchmarks with considerable margins.

随着视频共享的普及，对高亮度检测等自动视频消解的需求也在不断增加。最近，拥有众包的时间同步视频评论的平台已经出现在世界各地，为重点检测提供了一个很好的机会。然而，这个任务并不是微不足道的：（1）时间同步的评论往往滞后于他们相应的镜头; （2）时间同步评论在语义上是稀疏和嘈杂的; （3）确定哪些镜头是高度主观的高光。本文旨在通过提出一个框架来解决这些挑战：（1）使用概念映射词汇链进行滞后校准; （2）基于每个镜头的评论强度以及情感和概念集中度来模拟视频集锦; （3）使用具有情感和概念映射的改进的SumBasic来总结每个检测到的突出显示。在大型现实世界的数据集上进行的实验表明，我们的高亮检测方法和汇总方法在性价比方面均优于其他基准。
