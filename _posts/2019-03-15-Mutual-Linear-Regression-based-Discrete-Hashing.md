##### Abstract
Label information is widely used in hashing methods because of its effectiveness of improving the precision. The existing hashing methods always use two different projections to represent the mutual regression between hash codes and class labels. In contrast to the existing methods, we propose a novel learning-based hashing method termed stable supervised discrete hashing with mutual linear regression (S2DHMLR) in this study, where only one stable projection is used to describe the linear correlation between hash codes and corresponding labels. To the best of our knowledge, this strategy has not been used for hashing previously. In addition, we further use a boosting strategy to improve the final performance of the proposed method without adding extra constraints and with little extra expenditure in terms of time and space. Extensive experiments conducted on three image benchmarks demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed method.
