##### Abstract
In this demo paper, we present a text simplification approach that is directed at improving the performance of state-of-the-art Open Relation Extraction (RE) systems. As syntactically complex sentences often pose a challenge for current Open RE approaches, we have developed a simplification framework that performs a pre-processing step by taking a single sentence as input and using a set of syntactic-based transformation rules to create a textual input that is easier to process for subsequently applied Open RE systems.

在这个演示文稿中，我们提出了一个文本简化方法，旨在提高最先进的开放式关系抽取（RE）系统的性能。由于句法复杂的句子通常对当前的开放再循环方法提出了挑战，我们开发了一个简化框架，通过将单个句子作为输入并使用一组基于句法的转换规则来创建文本输入来执行预处理步骤对于随后应用的开放式可再用系统更容易处理。
