##### Abstract
The goal of our work is to discover dominant objects without using any annotations. We focus on performing unsupervised object discovery and localization in a strictly general setting where only a single image is given. This is far more challenge than typical co-localization or weakly-supervised localization tasks. To tackle this problem, we propose a simple but effective pattern mining-based method, called Object Mining (OM), which exploits the ad-vantages of data mining and feature representation of pre-trained convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Specifically,Object Mining first converts the feature maps from a pre-trained CNN model into a set of transactions, and then frequent patterns are discovered from transaction data base through pattern mining techniques. We observe that those discovered patterns, i.e., co-occurrence highlighted regions,typically hold appearance and spatial consistency. Motivated by this observation, we can easily discover and localize possible objects by merging relevant meaningful pat-terns in an unsupervised manner. Extensive experiments on a variety of benchmarks demonstrate that Object Mining achieves competitive performance compared with the state-of-the-art methods.
