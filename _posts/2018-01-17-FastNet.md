##### Abstract
Inception and the Resnet family of Convolutional Neural Network archi-tectures have broken records in the past few years, but recent state of the art models have also incurred very high computational cost in terms of training, inference and model size. Making the deployment of these models on Edge devices, impractical. In light of this, we present a new novel architecture that is designed for high computational efficiency on both GPUs and CPUs, and is highly suited for deployment on Mobile Applications, Smart Cameras, Iot devices and controllers as well as low cost drones. Our architecture boasts competitive accuracies on standard Datasets even out-performing the original Resnet. We present below the motivation for this research, the architecture of the network, single test accuracies on CIFAR 10 and CIFAR 100 , a detailed comparison with other well-known architectures and link to an implementation in Keras.

初始和卷积神经网络的Resnet族在过去几年中已经打破了记录，但是最近的先进模型在训练，推理和模型大小方面也招致了非常高的计算成本。在Edge设备上部署这些模型是不切实际的。鉴于此，我们提出了一种新的架构，旨在提高GPU和CPU的计算效率，非常适合在移动应用，智能相机，Iot设备和控制器以及低成本无人机上部署。我们的架构在标准数据集上具有竞争力，甚至胜过原始的Resnet。我们下面介绍了本研究的动机，网络架构，CIFAR 10和CIFAR 100上的单一测试精度，与其他着名架构的详细比较以及在Keras中实现的链接。
