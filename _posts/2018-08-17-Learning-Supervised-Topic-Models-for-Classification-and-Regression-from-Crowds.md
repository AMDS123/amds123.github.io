##### Abstract
The growing need to analyze large collections of documents has led to great developments in topic modeling. Since documents are frequently associated with other related variables, such as labels or ratings, much interest has been placed on supervised topic models. However, the nature of most annotation tasks, prone to ambiguity and noise, often with high volumes of documents, deem learning under a single-annotator assumption unrealistic or unpractical for most real-world applications. In this article, we propose two supervised topic models, one for classification and another for regression problems, which account for the heterogeneity and biases among different annotators that are encountered in practice when learning from crowds. We develop an efficient stochastic variational inference algorithm that is able to scale to very large datasets, and we empirically demonstrate the advantages of the proposed model over state-of-the-art approaches.

##### Abstract (translated by Google)
分析大量文档的不断增长的需求导致了主题建模的巨大发展。由于文档经常与其他相关变量（例如标签或评级）相关联，因此对受监督的主题模型非常感兴趣。然而，大多数注释任务的性质，容易出现模糊和噪声，往往是大量的文档，认为在单注释器假设下学习对于大多数现实世界的应用来说是不切实际或不实用的。在本文中，我们提出了两个有监督的主题模型，一个用于分类，另一个用于回归问题，它们解释了在从群体中学习时在实践中遇到的不同注释器之间的异质性和偏差。我们开发了一种有效的随机变分推理算法，能够扩展到非常大的数据集，并且我们凭经验证明了所提出的模型相对于最先进方法的优势。
