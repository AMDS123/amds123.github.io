##### Abstract
The paper describes a deep network based object detector specialized for ball detection in long shot videos. Due to its fully convolutional design, the method operates on images of any size and produces \emph{ball confidence map} encoding the position of detected ball. The network uses hypercolumn concept, where feature maps from different hierarchy levels of the deep convolutional network are combined and jointly fed to the convolutional classification layer. This allows boosting the detection accuracy as larger visual context around the object of interest is taken into account. The method achieves state-of-the-art results when tested on publicly available ISSIA-CNR Soccer Dataset.
