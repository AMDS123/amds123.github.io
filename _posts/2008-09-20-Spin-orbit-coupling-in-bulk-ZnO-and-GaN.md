##### Abstract
Using group theory and Kane-like $\mathbf{k\cdot p}$ model together with the LÃ¶wdining partition method, we derive the expressions of spin-orbit coupling of electrons and holes, including the linear-$k$ Rashba term due to the intrinsic structure inversion asymmetry and the cubic-$k$ Dresselhaus term due to the bulk inversion asymmetry in wurtzite semiconductors. The coefficients of the electron and hole Dresselhaus terms of ZnO and GaN in wurtzite structure and GaN in zinc-blende structure are calculated using the nearest-neighbor $sp^3$ and $sp^3s^\ast$ tight-binding models separately.
