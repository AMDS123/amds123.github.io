##### Abstract
Facebook uses Artificial Intelligence for targeting users with advertisements based on the events in which they engage like sharing, liking, making comments, posts by a friend, a group creation, etcetera. Each user interacts with these events in different ways, thus receiving different recommendations curated by Facebook's intelligent systems. Facebook segregates its users into chambers, fragmenting them into communities. The technology has completely changed the marketing domain. It is however caught in a race for our finite attention with a motive to make more and more money. Facebook is not a neutral product. It is programmed to get users addicted to it with a goal of gaining added information about the users and optimizing the recommendations provided to the users according to his or her preferences. This paper delineates how Facebook's recommendation system works and presents three methods to safeguard human vulnerabilities exploited by Facebook and other corporations.
