##### Abstract
While convolutional neural networks have gained impressive success recently in solving structured prediction problems such as semantic segmentation, it remains a challenge to differentiate individual object instances in the scene. Instance segmentation is very important in a variety of applications, such as autonomous driving, image captioning, and visual question answering. Techniques that combine large graphical models with low-level vision have been proposed to address this problem; however, we propose an end-to-end recurrent neural network (RNN) architecture with an attention mechanism to model a human-like counting process, and produce detailed instance segmentations. The network is jointly trained to sequentially produce regions of interest as well as a dominant object segmentation within each region. The proposed model achieves competitive results on the CVPPP, KITTI, and Cityscapes datasets.

虽然卷积神经网络最近在解决结构化预测问题（如语义分割）方面取得了令人瞩目的成就，但区分场景中的单个对象实例仍然是一个挑战。实例分割在各种应用中非常重要，如自动驾驶，图像字幕和视觉问题回答。已经提出将大型图形模型与低级视觉相结合的技术来解决这个问题;然而，我们提出了一种端到端递归神经网络（RNN）体系结构，其具有用于模拟类人计数过程的注意机制，并产生详细的实例分割。该网络被联合训练，以便在每个区域内顺序地产生感兴趣的区域以及主要的对象分割。所提出的模型在CVPPP，KITTI和Cityscapes数据集上获得了有竞争力的结果。
