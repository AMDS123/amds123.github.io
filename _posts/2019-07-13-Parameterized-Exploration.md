##### Abstract
We introduce Parameterized Exploration (PE), a simple family of methods for model-based tuning of the exploration schedule in sequential decision problems. Unlike common heuristics for exploration, our method accounts for the time horizon of the decision problem as well as the agent's current state of knowledge of the dynamics of the decision problem. We show our method as applied to several common exploration techniques has superior performance relative to un-tuned counterparts in Bernoulli and Gaussian multi-armed bandits, contextual bandits, and a Markov decision process based on a mobile health (mHealth) study. We also examine the effects of the accuracy of the estimated dynamics model on the performance of PE.
