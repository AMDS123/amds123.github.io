##### Abstract
Under dynamic conditions on bridges, we need a real-time management. To this end, this paper presents a rule-based decision support system in which the necessary rules are extracted from simulation results made by Aimsun traffic micro-simulation software. Then, these rules are generalized by the aid of fuzzy rule generation algorithms. Then, they are trained by a set of supervised and the unsupervised learning algorithms to get an ability to make decision in real cases. As a pilot case study, Nasr Bridge in Tehran is simulated in Aimsun and WEKA data mining software is used to execute the learning algorithms. Based on this experiment, the accuracy of the supervised algorithms to generalize the rules is greater than 80%. In addition, CART decision tree and sequential minimal optimization (SMO) provides 100% accuracy for normal data and these algorithms are so reliable for crisis management on bridge. This means that, it is possible to use such machine learning methods to manage bridges in the real-time conditions.

在桥梁的动态条件下，我们需要实时管理。为此，本文提出了一种基于规则的决策支持系统，其中从Aimsun交通微仿真软件的仿真结果中提取出必要的规则。然后，借助于模糊规则生成算法推广这些规则。然后，他们通过一组监督和无监督学习算法进行训练，以获得在实际案例中做出决策的能力。作为一个试点案例研究，德黑兰的Nasr Bridge在Aimsun进行了模拟，WEKA数据挖掘软件用于执行学习算法。基于该实验，监督算法推广规则的准确率大于80％。此外，CART决策树和顺序最小化优化（SMO）为普通数据提供100％的准确性，这些算法对于桥上的危机管理非常可靠。这意味着，可以使用这种机器学习方法来管理实时条件下的桥接。
