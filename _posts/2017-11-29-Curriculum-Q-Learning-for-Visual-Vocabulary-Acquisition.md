##### Abstract
The structure of curriculum plays a vital role in our learning process, both as children and adults. Presenting material in ascending order of difficulty that also exploits prior knowledge can have a significant impact on the rate of learning. However, the notion of difficulty and prior knowledge differs from person to person. Motivated by the need for a personalised curriculum, we present a novel method of curriculum learning for vocabulary words in the form of visual prompts. We employ a reinforcement learning model grounded in pedagogical theories that emulates the actions of a tutor. We simulate three students with different levels of vocabulary knowledge in order to evaluate the how well our model adapts to the environment. The results of the simulation reveal that through interaction, the model is able to identify the areas of weakness, as well as push students to the edge of their ZPD. We hypothesise that these methods can also be effective in training agents to learn language representations in a simulated environment where it has previously been shown that order of words and prior knowledge play an important role in the efficacy of language learning.

课程结构在我们的学习过程中起着至关重要的作用，无论是儿童还是成年人。按照难度升序呈现材料，也利用先验知识可以对学习速度产生重大影响。然而，困难和先验知识的概念因人而异。受到个性化课程需求的驱动，我们提出了一种以视觉提示形式的词汇课程学习新方法。我们采用以模仿教师行为的教学理论为基础的强化学习模式。我们模拟了三个不同水平的词汇知识的学生，以评估我们的模型如何适应环境。模拟结果表明，通过互动，模型能够识别弱点，并将学生推到他们的ZPD的边缘。我们假设这些方法也可以有效地训练代理人在模拟环境中学习语言表示，其中之前已经表明，词语顺序和先前知识在语言学习的功效中发挥重要作用。
