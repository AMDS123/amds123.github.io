##### Abstract
Pap smear testing has been widely used for detecting cervical cancers based on the morphology properties of cell nuclei in microscopic image. An accurate nuclei segmentation could thus improve the success rate of cervical cancer screening. In this work, a method of automated cervical nuclei segmentation using Deformable Multipath Ensemble Model (D-MEM) is proposed. The approach adopts a U-shaped convolutional network as a backbone network, in which dense blocks are used to transfer feature information more effectively. To increase the flexibility of the model, we then use deformable convolution to deal with different nuclei irregular shapes and sizes. To reduce the predictive bias, we further construct multiple networks with different settings, which form an ensemble model. The proposed segmentation framework has achieved state-of-the-art accuracy on Herlev dataset with Zijdenbos similarity index (ZSI) of 0.933, and has the potential to be extended for solving other medical image segmentation tasks.
