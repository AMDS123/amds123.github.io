##### Abstract
Recently, there have been several high-profile achievements of agents learning to play games against humans and beat them. We consider an alternative approach that instead addresses game design for a better player experience by training human-like game agents. Specifically, we study the problem of training game agents in service of the development processes of the game developers that design, build, and operate modern games. We highlight some of the ways in which we think intelligent agents can assist game developers to understand their games, and even to build them. Our early results using the proposed agent framework mark a few steps toward addressing the unique challenges that game developers face.
