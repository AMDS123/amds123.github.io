##### Abstract
Despite the advent of autonomous cars, it's likely - at least in the near future - that human attention will still maintain a central role as a guarantee in terms of legal responsibility during the driving task. In this paper we study the dynamics of the driver's gaze and use it as a proxy to understand related attentional mechanisms. First, we build our analysis upon two questions: where and what the driver is looking at? Second, we model the driver's gaze by training a coarse-to-fine convolutional network on short sequences extracted from the DR(eye)VE dataset. Experimental comparison against different baselines reveal that the driver's gaze can indeed be learnt to some extent, despite i) being highly subjective and ii) having only one driver's gaze available for each sequence due to the irreproducibility of the scene. Eventually, we advocate for a new assisted driving paradigm which suggests to the driver, with no intervention, where she should focus her attention.

尽管自动驾驶汽车的出现，至少在不久的将来，至少在不久的将来，驾驶任务中的人的注意力仍然可以作为法律责任保证的中心角色。在本文中，我们研究驾驶员注视的动态，并将其用作理解相关注意机制的代理。首先，我们分析两个问题：司机在哪里以及在看什么？其次，我们通过训练从DR（眼睛）VE数据集中提取的短序列的粗到细卷积网络来对驾驶员的注视进行建模。不同基线的实验比较表明，驾驶员的视线确实可以在一定程度上学习，尽管i）具有高度主观性，并且ii）由于场景的不可重现性，每个序列仅具有一个驾驶员的视线。最终，我们提倡一种新的辅助驾驶模式，向驾驶员暗示，她没有任何干预，应该集中注意力。
