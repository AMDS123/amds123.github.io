##### Abstract
Voice disguise, purposeful modification of one's speaker identity with the aim of avoiding being identified as oneself, is a low-effort way to fool speaker recognition, whether performed by a human or an automatic speaker verification (ASV) system. We present an evaluation of the effectiveness of age stereotypes as a voice disguise strategy, as a follow up to our recent work where 60 native Finnish speakers attempted to sound like an elderly and like a child. In that study, we presented evidence that both ASV and human observers could easily miss the target speaker but we did not address how believable the presented vocal age stereotypes were; this study serves to fill that gap. The interesting cases would be speakers who succeed in being missed by the ASV system, and which a typical listener cannot detect as being a disguise. We carry out a perceptual test to study the quality of the disguised speech samples. The listening test was carried out both locally and with the help of Amazon's Mechanical Turk (MT) crowd-workers. A total of 91 listeners participated in the test and were instructed to estimate both the speaker's chronological and intended age. The results indicate that age estimations for the intended old and child voices for female speakers were towards the target age groups, while for male speakers, the age estimations corresponded to the direction of the target voice only for elderly voices. In the case of intended child's voice, listeners estimated the age of male speakers to be older than their chronological age for most of the speakers and not the intended target age.

语音伪装，以避免被识别为自己的目的，有目的地修改自己的说话人身份，是一种欺骗说话人识别的低效方式，无论是由人类还是自动说话人验证（ASV）系统来执行。我们对年龄刻板印象作为语音伪装策略的有效性进行了评估，作为我们最近的工作的后续行动，芬兰60名土着讲话者试图听起来像老人，像孩子一样。在那项研究中，我们提出了证据表明ASV和人类观察者都可能很容易错过目标说话人，但我们没有提到声音陈旧定型的可信度如何;这项研究有助于填补这一空白。有趣的例子是成功被ASV系统遗漏的演讲者，以及典型的听众无法察觉的伪装。我们进行感知测试来研究伪装语音样本的质量。听力测试在当地进行，并在亚马逊的Mechanical Turk（MT）人群工作人员的帮助下进行。共有91名听众参加了这次测试，并被指示估计演讲者的年代和年龄。结果表明，针对女性演讲者的预期的老人和小孩声音的年龄估计朝向目标年龄组，而对于男性演讲者，年龄估计仅针对老年人声音的目标声音的方向。对于有意的孩子的声音，听众估计男性演讲者的年龄比大多数演讲者的年龄大，而不是预期的目标年龄。
