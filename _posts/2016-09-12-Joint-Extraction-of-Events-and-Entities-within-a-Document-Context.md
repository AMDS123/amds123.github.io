##### Abstract
Events and entities are closely related; entities are often actors or participants in events and events without entities are uncommon. The interpretation of events and entities is highly contextually dependent. Existing work in information extraction typically models events separately from entities, and performs inference at the sentence level, ignoring the rest of the document. In this paper, we propose a novel approach that models the dependencies among variables of events, entities, and their relations, and performs joint inference of these variables across a document. The goal is to enable access to document-level contextual information and facilitate context-aware predictions. We demonstrate that our approach substantially outperforms the state-of-the-art methods for event extraction as well as a strong baseline for entity extraction.

##### Abstract (translated by Google)
事件和实体密切相关;实体往往是演员或事件的参与者，没有实体的事件是不常见的。事件和实体的解释是高度依赖于内容的。现有的信息抽取工作通常将事件与实体分开建模，并在句子级别执行推理，忽略文档的其余部分。在本文中，我们提出了一种新的方法来模拟事件，实体及其关系变量之间的依赖关系，并对这些变量在文档中进行联合推断。目标是使访问文档级的上下文信息和促进上下文感知的预测。我们证明，我们的方法大大优于最先进的事件提取方法，以及强大的实体提取基线。
