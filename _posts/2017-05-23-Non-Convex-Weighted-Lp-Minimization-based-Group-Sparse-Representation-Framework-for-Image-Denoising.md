##### Abstract
Nonlocal image representation or group sparsity has attracted considerable interest in various low-level vision tasks and has led to several state-of-the-art image denoising techniques, such as BM3D, LSSC. In the past, convex optimization with sparsity-promoting convex regularization was usually regarded as a standard scheme for estimating sparse signals in noise. However, using convex regularization can not still obtain the correct sparsity solution under some practical problems including image inverse problems. In this paper we propose a non-convex weighted $\ell_p$ minimization based group sparse representation (GSR) framework for image denoising. To make the proposed scheme tractable and robust, the generalized soft-thresholding (GST) algorithm is adopted to solve the non-convex $\ell_p$ minimization problem. In addition, to improve the accuracy of the nonlocal similar patches selection, an adaptive patch search (APS) scheme is proposed. Experimental results have demonstrated that the proposed approach not only outperforms many state-of-the-art denoising methods such as BM3D and WNNM, but also results in a competitive speed.

非局部图像表示或群体稀疏性引起了各种低级视觉任务的极大兴趣，并导致了几种最先进的图像去噪技术，如BM3D，LSSC。过去，稀疏凸正则化的凸优化通常被认为是估计噪声中稀疏信号的标准方案。但是，在图像逆问题等实际问题中，使用凸正则化仍然无法获得正确的稀疏解。在本文中，我们提出了一个基于非凸加权$ \ ell_p $最小化的组稀疏表示（GSR）框架的图像去噪。为了使所提出的方案简单且鲁棒，采用广义软阈值（GST）算法求解非凸$ \ ell_p $最小化问题。另外，为了提高非局部类似斑块选择的准确性，提出了一种自适应斑块搜索（APS）方案。实验结果表明，所提出的方法不仅比BM3D和WNNM等先进的去噪方法优越，而且还具有竞争的速度。
