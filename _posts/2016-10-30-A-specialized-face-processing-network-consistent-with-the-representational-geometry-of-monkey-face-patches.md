##### Abstract
Ample evidence suggests that face processing in human and non-human primates is performed differently compared with other objects. Converging reports, both physiologically and psychophysically, indicate that faces are processed in specialized neural networks in the brain -i.e. face patches in monkeys and the fusiform face area (FFA) in humans. We are all expert face-processing agents, and able to identify very subtle differences within the category of faces, despite substantial visual and featural similarities. Identification is performed rapidly and accurately after viewing a whole face, while significantly drops if some of the face configurations (e.g. inversion, misalignment) are manipulated or if partial views of faces are shown due to occlusion. This refers to a hotly-debated, yet highly-supported concept, known as holistic face processing. We built a hierarchical computational model of face-processing based on evidence from recent neuronal and behavioural studies on faces processing in primates. Representational geometries of the last three layers of the model have characteristics similar to those observed in monkey face patches (posterior, middle and anterior patches). Furthermore, several face-processing-related phenomena reported in the literature automatically emerge as properties of this model. The representations are evolved through several computational layers, using biologically plausible learning rules. The model satisfies face inversion effect, composite face effect, other race effect, view and identity selectivity, and canonical face views. To our knowledge, no models have so far been proposed with this performance and agreement with biological data.

充足的证据表明，与其他物体相比，人类和非人类灵长类动物的面部处理的表现不同。融合生理和心理学的报告表明，脸部是在大脑中专门的神经网络中处理 - 即。猴子面部贴片和人类梭形面部面积（FFA）。我们都是专家的脸部处理代理，并能够识别面部类别中的细微差异，尽管有相当大的视觉和不自然的相似性。在观看整个脸部之后识别被快速而准确地执行，而如果操纵一些脸部构造（例如反转，未对准）或者由于遮挡而显示脸部的部分视图，则显着下降。这是一个热烈辩论，但高度支持的概念，被称为整体面部处理。我们基于近期关于灵长类动物面部处理的神经元和行为研究的证据，建立了一个面部处理的分层计算模型。模型的最后三层的代表性几何特征具有与在猴脸贴片（后面的，中间的和前面的贴片）中观察到的相似的特征。此外，文献中报道的几个与面部处理有关的现象自动地成为这个模型的特征。这些陈述是通过几个计算层进行的，使用生物学上合理的学习规则。该模型满足面孔反转效应，复合面孔效应，其他种族效应，视图和身份选择性以及典型面孔视图。据我们所知，到目前为止还没有提出用这种性能和生物学数据的协议来建立模型。
