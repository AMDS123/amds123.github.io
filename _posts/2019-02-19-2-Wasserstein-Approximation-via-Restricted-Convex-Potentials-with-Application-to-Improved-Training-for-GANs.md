##### Abstract
We provide a framework to approximate the 2-Wasserstein distance and the optimal transport map, amenable to efficient training as well as statistical and geometric analysis. With the quadratic cost and considering the Kantorovich dual form of the optimal transportation problem, the Brenier theorem states that the optimal potential function is convex and the optimal transport map is the gradient of the optimal potential function. Using this geometric structure, we restrict the optimization problem to different parametrized classes of convex functions and pay special attention to the class of input-convex neural networks. We analyze the statistical generalization and the discriminative power of the resulting approximate metric, and we prove a restricted moment-matching property for the approximate optimal map. Finally, we discuss a numerical algorithm to solve the restricted optimization problem and provide numerical experiments to illustrate and compare the proposed approach with the established regularization-based approaches. We further discuss practical implications of our proposal in a modular and interpretable design for GANs which connects the generator training with discriminator computations to allow for learning an overall composite generator.
