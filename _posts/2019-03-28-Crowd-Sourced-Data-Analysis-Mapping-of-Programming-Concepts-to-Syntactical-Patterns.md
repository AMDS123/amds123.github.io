##### Abstract
Since programming concepts do not match their syntactic representations, code search is a very tedious task. For instance in Java or C, array doesn't match [], so using "array" as a query, one cannot find what they are looking for. Often developers have to search code whether to understand any code, or to reuse some part of that code, or just to read it, without natural language searching, developers have to often scroll back and forth or use variable names as their queries. In our work, we have used Stackoverflow (SO) question and answers to make a mapping of programming concepts with their respective natural language keywords, and then tag these natural language terms to every line of code, which can further we used in searching using natural language keywords.
