##### Abstract
We are at an exciting time for machine lipreading. Traditional research stemmed from the adaptation of audio recognition systems. But now, the computer vision community is also participating. This joining of two previously disparate areas with different perspectives on computer lipreading is creating opportunities for collaborations, but in doing so the literature is experiencing challenges in knowledge sharing due to multiple uses of terms and phrases and the range of methods for scoring results. In particular we highlight three areas with the intention to improve communication between those researching lipreading; the effects of interchanging between speech reading and lipreading; speaker dependence across train, validation, and test splits; and the use of accuracy, correctness, errors, and varying units (phonemes, visemes, words, and sentences) to measure system performance. We make recommendations as to how we can be more consistent.

我们正处于一个激动人心的时刻。传统的研究源于音频识别系统的改编。但是现在，计算机视觉界也在参与其中。这两个以前不同的领域在计算机唇读的不同领域的加入正在创造合作的机会，但在这样做，由于多次使用的术语和短语和评分结果的方法范围，文献正在经历知识共享的挑战。我们特别强调了三个方面，旨在改善那些研究口译的沟通。语音阅读与唇读交流的影响;讲话者对列车的依赖，验证和测试分裂;以及使用准确性，正确性，错误和不同单位（音位，视位，词语和句子）来衡量系统性能。我们就如何更加一致地提出建议。
