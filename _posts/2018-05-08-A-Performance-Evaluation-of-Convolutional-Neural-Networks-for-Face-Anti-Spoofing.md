##### Abstract
In the current era, biometric based access control is becoming more popular due to its simplicity and ease to use by the users. It reduces the manual work of identity recognition and facilitates the automatic processing. Face is one of the most important biometric visual information that can be easily captured without user cooperation in uncontrolled environment. Precise detection of spoofed faces should be on the high priority to make face based identity recognition and access control robust against possible attacks. The recently evolved Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based deep learning technique has been proved as one of the excellent method to deal with the visual information very effectively. The CNN learns the hierarchical features at intermediate layers automatically from the data. Several CNN based methods such as Inception and ResNet have shown outstanding performance for image classification problem. This paper does a performance evaluation of CNNs for face anti-spoofing. The Inception and ResNet CNN architectures are used in this study. The results are computed over benchmark MSU Mobile Face Spoofing Database. The experiments are done by considering the different aspects such as depth of the model, random weight initialization vs weight transfer, fine tuning vs training from scratch and different learning rate. The favorable results are obtained using these CNN architectures for face anti-spoofing in different settings.

在当前时代，基于生物识别的访问控制由于其简单性和易用性而变得越来越流行。它减少了身份识别的手工工作，并且便于自动处理。脸部是最重要的生物特征视觉信息之一，无需用户在不受控制的环境中进行合作即可轻松捕捉。精确检测欺骗面孔应该是高度优先的，以使基于人脸的身份识别和访问控制对可能的攻击具有鲁棒性。最近发展的基于卷积神经网络（CNN）的深度学习技术已被证明是非常有效处理视觉信息的优秀方法之一。 CNN从数据中自动学习中间层的分层特征。几种基于CNN的方法，如Inception和ResNet在图像分类问题上表现出色。本文对CNNs进行面部反欺骗的性能评估。 Inception和ResNet CNN架构用于本研究。结果在基准MSU Mobile Face Spoofing数据库上进行计算。通过考虑模型深度，随机权重初始化与权重转移，从头开始的微调与训练以及不同的学习速率等不同方面来完成实验。使用这些CNN体系结构在不同环境中进行面部反欺骗可获得令人满意的结果。
