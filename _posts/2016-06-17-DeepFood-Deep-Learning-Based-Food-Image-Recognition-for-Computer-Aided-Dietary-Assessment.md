##### Abstract
Worldwide, in 2014, more than 1.9 billion adults, 18 years and older, were overweight. Of these, over 600 million were obese. Accurately documenting dietary caloric intake is crucial to manage weight loss, but also presents challenges because most of the current methods for dietary assessment must rely on memory to recall foods eaten. The ultimate goal of our research is to develop computer-aided technical solutions to enhance and improve the accuracy of current measurements of dietary intake. Our proposed system in this paper aims to improve the accuracy of dietary assessment by analyzing the food images captured by mobile devices (e.g., smartphone). The key technique innovation in this paper is the deep learning-based food image recognition algorithms. Substantial research has demonstrated that digital imaging accurately estimates dietary intake in many environments and it has many advantages over other methods. However, how to derive the food information (e.g., food type and portion size) from food image effectively and efficiently remains a challenging and open research problem. We propose a new Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-based food image recognition algorithm to address this problem. We applied our proposed approach to two real-world food image data sets (UEC-256 and Food-101) and achieved impressive results. To the best of our knowledge, these results outperformed all other reported work using these two data sets. Our experiments have demonstrated that the proposed approach is a promising solution for addressing the food image recognition problem. Our future work includes further improving the performance of the algorithms and integrating our system into a real-world mobile and cloud computing-based system to enhance the accuracy of current measurements of dietary intake.

在全球范围内，2014年，超过19亿十八岁及以上的成年人超重。其中6亿多人是肥胖的。准确记录饮食中的卡路里摄入量对于控制体重减轻至关重要，但也带来了挑战，因为目前大多数膳食评估方法都必须依靠记忆来回忆食物。我们研究的最终目标是开发计算机辅助技术解决方案，以提高和改善当前饮食摄入量的准确性。本文提出的系统旨在通过分析移动设备（如智能手机）捕获的食物图像来提高膳食评估的准确性。本文的关键技术创新是基于深度学习的食物图像识别算法。大量的研究已经证明，数字成像可以准确地估计许多环境中的饮食摄入量，并且与其他方法相比，它具有许多优点。然而，如何有效而高效地从食物图像中导出食物信息（例如，食物类型和份量大小）仍然是一个具有挑战性和开放性的研究问题。我们提出了一种新的基于卷积神经网络（CNN）的食物图像识别算法来解决这个问题。我们将我们提出的方法应用于两个真实世界的食物图像数据集（UEC-256和Food-101）并取得了令人印象深刻的结果。据我们所知，这些结果比使用这两个数据集的所有其他报告的工作都要好。我们的实验已经证明，所提出的方法是解决食物图像识别问题的有前景的解决方案。我们未来的工作包括进一步改进算法的性能，并将我们的系统集成到真实的移动和基于云计算的系统中，以提高当前饮食摄入量的准确性。
