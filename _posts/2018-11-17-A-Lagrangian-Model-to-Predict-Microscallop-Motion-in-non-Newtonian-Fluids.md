##### Abstract
The need to develop models to predict the motion of microrobots, or robots of a much smaller scale, moving in fluids in a low Reynolds number regime, and in particular, in non Newtonian fluids, cannot be understated. The article develops a Lagrangian based model for one such mechanism - a two-link mechanism termed a microscallop, moving in a low Reynolds number environment in a non Newtonian fluid. The modelling proceeds through the conventional Lagrangian construction for a two-link mechanism and then goes on to model the external fluid forces using empirically based models for viscosity to complete the dynamic model. The derived model is then simulated for different initial conditions and key parameters of the non Newtonian fluid, and the results are corroborated with a few existing experimental results on a similar mechanism under identical conditions.
