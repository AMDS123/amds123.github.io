##### Abstract
The syntactic structure of sentences exhibits a striking regularity: dependencies tend to not cross when drawn above the sentence. We investigate two competing explanations. The traditional hypothesis is that this trend arises from an independent principle of syntax that reduces crossings practically to zero. An alternative to this view is the hypothesis that crossings are a side effect of dependency lengths, i.e. sentences with shorter dependency lengths should tend to have fewer crossings. We are able to reject the traditional view in the majority of languages considered. The alternative hypothesis can lead to a more parsimonious theory of language.

##### Abstract (translated by Google)
句子的句法结构具有显着的规律性：当在句子上面绘制时，依赖关系往往不交叉。我们调查两个相互竞争的解释。传统的假设是，这种趋势是由一个独立的句法原则引起的，实际上将交叉点减少到了零。这种观点的另一种选择是假设交叉是依赖长度的副作用，即具有较短依赖长度的句子应该倾向于具有较少的交叉。我们能够以所考虑的大多数语言拒绝传统观点。另一种假设可以导致更简洁的语言理论。
