##### Abstract
Constraint answer set programming integrates answer set programming with constraint processing. System EZSMT+ is a constraint answer set programming tool that utilizes satisfiability modulo theory solvers for search. Its theoretical foundation lies on generalizations of Niemela's characterization of answer sets of a logic program via so called level rankings.
