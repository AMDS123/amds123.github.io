##### Abstract
A novel lattice coding framework is proposed for outage-limited cooperative channels. This framework provides practical implementations for the optimal cooperation protocols proposed by Azarian et al. In particular, for the relay channel we implement a variant of the dynamic decode and forward protocol, which uses orthogonal constellations to reduce the channel seen by the destination to a single-input single-output time-selective one, while inheriting the same diversity-multiplexing tradeoff. This simplification allows for building the receiver using traditional belief propagation or tree search architectures. Our framework also generalizes the coding scheme of Yang and Belfiore in the context of amplify and forward cooperation. For the cooperative multiple access channel, a tree coding approach, matched to the optimal linear cooperation protocol of Azarain et al, is developed. For this scenario, the MMSE-DFE Fano decoder is shown to enjoy an excellent tradeoff between performance and complexity. Finally, the utility of the proposed schemes is established via a comprehensive simulation study.
