##### Abstract
The effect of film morphology on its surface chemistry and band structure has been analyzed for gallium nitride epitaxial films grown by molecular beam epitaxy. The film morphology has been studied using scanning electron microscopy and atomic force microscopy, and the bandstructure, defect and emission properties have been studied by X ray photoelectron spectroscopy and cathodoluminescence spectroscopy. It was found that the highly porous GaN nanowall network shows the highest relative conductivity and does not have defect related luminescence. The flatter films were more resistive and showed yellow luminescence, due to Ga vacancies. GaN nanowall network exhibited a Fermi level pinning at (1.8 $\pm$ 0.2) eV above valence band maximum, suggesting the presence of a Ga adlayer on the surface of GaN nanowall network. Ar ion sputtering was found to preferentially sputter N atoms leading to surface metallization.

对分子束外延生长的氮化镓外延薄膜分析了薄膜形貌对其表面化学性质和能带结构的影响。用扫描电子显微镜和原子力显微镜研究了薄膜的形貌，用X射线光电子能谱和阴极发光光谱研究了薄膜的结构，缺陷和发射性能。发现高度多孔的GaN纳米壁网络显示出最高的相对电导率，并且没有缺陷相关的发光。由于Ga空位，平坦的薄膜更具电阻性并显示黄色发光。 GaN纳米墙网络在费米能级最大值（1.8 $ \ pm $ 0.2）eV处显示费米能级钉扎，表明在GaN纳米壁网络的表面上存在Ga附着层。发现Ar离子溅射优先溅射N原子，导致表面金属化。
