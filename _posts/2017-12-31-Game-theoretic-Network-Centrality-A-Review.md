##### Abstract
Game-theoretic centrality is a flexible and sophisticated approach to identify the most important nodes in a network. It builds upon the methods from cooperative game theory and network theory. The key idea is to treat nodes as players in a cooperative game, where the value of each coalition is determined by certain graph-theoretic properties. Using solution concepts from cooperative game theory, it is then possible to measure how responsible each node is for the worth of the network. 
 The literature on the topic is already quite large, and is scattered among game-theoretic and computer science venues. We review the main game-theoretic network centrality measures from both bodies of literature and organize them into two categories: those that are more focused on the connectivity of nodes, and those that are more focused on the synergies achieved by nodes in groups. We present and explain each centrality, with a focus on algorithms and complexity.

##### Abstract (translated by Google)
博弈论中心性是识别网络中最重要节点的灵活和复杂的方法。它建立在合作博弈论和网络理论的基础上。关键的思想是把节点当作合作博弈中的参与者，其中每个联盟的价值是由一定的图论性质决定的。使用合作博弈理论的解决方案概念，就可以测量每个节点对于网络价值的责任。
 关于这个话题的文献已经相当多，分散在博弈论和计算机科学的场合。我们从两个文献主体回顾了主要的博弈论网络中心性测度，并将它们分为两类：更加关注节点连通性的类型，以及更注重节点之间协同效应的类别。我们介绍和解释每个中心性，重点放在算法和复杂性上。
