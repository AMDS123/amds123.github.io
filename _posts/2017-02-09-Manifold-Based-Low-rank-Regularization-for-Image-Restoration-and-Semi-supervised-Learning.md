##### Abstract
Low-rank structures play important role in recent advances of many problems in image science and data science. As a natural extension of low-rank structures for data with nonlinear structures, the concept of the low-dimensional manifold structure has been considered in many data processing problems. Inspired by this concept, we consider a manifold based low-rank regularization as a linear approximation of manifold dimension. This regularization is less restricted than the global low-rank regularization, and thus enjoy more flexibility to handle data with nonlinear structures. As applications, we demonstrate the proposed regularization to classical inverse problems in image sciences and data sciences including image inpainting, image super-resolution, X-ray computer tomography (CT) image reconstruction and semi-supervised learning. We conduct intensive numerical experiments in several image restoration problems and a semi-supervised learning problem of classifying handwritten digits using the MINST data. Our numerical tests demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods and illustrate that the new regularization methods produce outstanding results by comparing with many existing methods.

低级结构在图像科学和数据科学中的许多问题的近期进展中起着重要的作用。作为具有非线性结构的数据的低阶结构的自然延伸，在许多数据处理问题中已经考虑了低维流形结构的概念。受这个概念的启发，我们考虑一个基于流形的低阶正则化作为流形维数的线性逼近。这种正则化不如全球低秩正规化那样受到限制，因此可以更灵活地处理具有非线性结构的数据。作为应用，我们证明了图像科学和数据科学中经典的逆问题的正则化方法，包括图像修复，图像超分辨率，X射线计算机断层扫描（CT）图像重建和半监督学习。我们对几个图像恢复问题进行了深入的数值实验，并使用MINST数据对手写数字进行分类的半监督学习问题。我们的数值试验证明了所提出的方法的有效性，并且说明新的正则化方法通过与许多现有的方法进行比较而产生出色的结果。
