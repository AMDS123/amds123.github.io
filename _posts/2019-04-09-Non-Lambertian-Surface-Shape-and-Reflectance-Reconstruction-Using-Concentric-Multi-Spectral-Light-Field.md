##### Abstract
Recovering the shape and reflectance of non-Lambertian surfaces remains a challenging problem in computer vision since the view-dependent appearance invalidates traditional photo-consistency constraint. In this paper, we introduce a novel concentric multi-spectral light field (CMSLF) design that is able to recover the shape and reflectance of surfaces with arbitrary material in one shot. Our CMSLF system consists of an array of cameras arranged on concentric circles where each ring captures a specific spectrum. Coupled with a multi-spectral ring light, we are able to sample viewpoint and lighting variations in a single shot via spectral multiplexing. We further show that such concentric camera/light setting results in a unique pattern of specular changes across views that enables robust depth estimation. We formulate a physical-based reflectance model on CMSLF to estimate depth and multi-spectral reflectance map without imposing any surface prior. Extensive synthetic and real experiments show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art light field-based techniques, especially in non-Lambertian scenes.
