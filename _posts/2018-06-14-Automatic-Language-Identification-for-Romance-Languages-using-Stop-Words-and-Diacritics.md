##### Abstract
Automatic language identification is a natural language processing problem that tries to determine the natural language of a given content. In this paper we present a statistical method for automatic language identification of written text using dictionaries containing stop words and diacritics. We propose different approaches that combine the two dictionaries to accurately determine the language of textual corpora. This method was chosen because stop words and diacritics are very specific to a language, although some languages have some similar words and special characters they are not all common. The languages taken into account were romance languages because they are very similar and usually it is hard to distinguish between them from a computational point of view. We have tested our method using a Twitter corpus and a news article corpus. Both corpora consists of UTF-8 encoded text, so the diacritics could be taken into account, in the case that the text has no diacritics only the stop words are used to determine the language of the text. The experimental results show that the proposed method has an accuracy of over 90% for small texts and over 99.8% for

自动语言识别是一种自然语言处理问题，它试图确定给定内容的自然语言。在本文中，我们提出了一种使用包含停用词和变音符的词典来自动识别书面文本的统计方法。我们提出不同的方法，结合这两种字典来准确地确定文本语料库的语言。选择此方法是因为停用词和变音符号对于某种语言非常具体，尽管某些语言具有一些类似的词和特殊字符，但它们并不常见。所考虑的语言是浪漫语言，因为它们非常相似，通常很难从计算的角度区分它们。我们使用Twitter语料库和新闻文章语料库测试了我们的方法。两个语料库都由UTF-8编码的文本组成，因此可以考虑变音符号，在文本没有变音符的情况下，只有停用词用于确定文本的语言。实验结果表明，该方法对小文本的准确率在90％以上，对于小文本的准确率在99.8％以上
