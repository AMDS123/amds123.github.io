##### Abstract
Instrument playing is among the most common scenes in music-related videos, which represent nowadays one of the largest sources of online videos. In order to understand the instrument-playing scenes in the videos, it is important to know what instruments are played, when they are played, and where the playing actions occur in the scene. While audio-based recognition of instruments has been widely studied, the visual aspect of the music instrument playing remains largely unaddressed in the literature. One of the main obstacles is the difficulty in collecting annotated data of the action locations for training-based methods. To address this issue, we propose a weakly-supervised framework to find when and where the instruments are played in the videos. We propose to use two auxiliary models, a sound model and an object model, to provide supervisions for training the instrument-playing action model. The sound model provides temporal supervisions, while the object model provides spatial supervisions. They together can simultaneously provide temporal and spatial supervisions. The resulted model only needs to analyze the visual part of a music video to deduce which, when and where instruments are played. We found that the proposed method significantly improves the localization accuracy. We evaluate the result of the proposed method temporally and spatially on a small dataset (totally 5,400 frames) that we manually annotated.

乐器演奏是音乐相关视频中最常见的场景之一，它代表了当今最大的在线视频来源之一。为了理解视频中的乐器演奏场景，了解演奏什么乐器，何时演奏以及演奏场景中的演奏动作很重要。尽管已经广泛研究了基于音频的乐器识别，但音乐乐器演奏的视觉方面在文献中仍大部分未得到解决。其中一个主要障碍是难以收集基于训练方法的行动地点的注释数据。为了解决这个问题，我们提出了一个弱监督框架，以查找视频中演奏乐器的时间和地点。我们建议使用两个辅助模型，一个声音模型和一个对象模型，为训练乐器演奏模型提供监督。声音模型提供时间监视，而对象模型提供空间监视。它们可以同时提供时间和空间的监督。结果模型只需分析音乐视频的视觉部分即可推断乐器演奏的时间和地点。我们发现所提出的方法显着提高了定位精度。我们在时间上和空间上评估所提出的方法的结果，在小数据集上（总共5,400帧）我们手动注释。
