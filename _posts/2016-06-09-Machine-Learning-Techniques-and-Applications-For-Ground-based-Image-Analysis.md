##### Abstract
Ground-based whole sky cameras have opened up new opportunities for monitoring the earth's atmosphere. These cameras are an important complement to satellite images by providing geoscientists with cheaper, faster, and more localized data. The images captured by whole sky imagers can have high spatial and temporal resolution, which is an important pre-requisite for applications such as solar energy modeling, cloud attenuation analysis, local weather prediction, etc. Extracting valuable information from the huge amount of image data by detecting and analyzing the various entities in these images is challenging. However, powerful machine learning techniques have become available to aid with the image analysis. This article provides a detailed walk-through of recent developments in these techniques and their applications in ground-based imaging. We aim to bridge the gap between computer vision and remote sensing with the help of illustrative examples. We demonstrate the advantages of using machine learning techniques in ground-based image analysis via three primary applications -- segmentation, classification, and denoising.

##### Abstract (translated by Google)
地基全天空相机为监测地球大气开辟了新的机遇。这些相机通过为地球科学家提供更便宜，更快速，更本地化的数据而成为卫星图像的重要补充。全天空成像仪拍摄的图像具有较高的空间和时间分辨率，是太阳能建模，云层衰减分析，局部天气预报等应用的重要前提条件。从海量图像数据中提取有价值的信息通过检测和分析这些图像中的各种实体是具有挑战性的。然而，功能强大的机器学习技术已经可以帮助进行图像分析。本文详细介绍了这些技术的最新发展及其在地面成像中的应用。我们的目标是通过说明性的例子来弥补计算机视觉和遥感之间的差距。我们展示了使用机器学习技术通过三个主要应用 - 分割，分类和去噪的基于地面的图像分析的优势。
