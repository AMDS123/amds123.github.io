##### Abstract
We present a supervised learning to rank algorithm that effectively orders images by exploiting the structure in image sequences. Most often in the supervised learning to rank literature, ranking is approached either by analyzing pairs of images or by optimizing a list-wise surrogate loss function on full sequences. In this work we propose MidRank, which learns from moderately sized sub-sequences instead. These sub-sequences contain useful structural ranking information that leads to better learnability during training and better generalization during testing. By exploiting sub-sequences, the proposed MidRank improves ranking accuracy considerably on an extensive array of image ranking applications and datasets.

我们提出了一种监督学习排序算法，通过利用图像序列中的结构有效地排序图像。大多数情况下，在有监督的学习排序文学，排名是通过分析图像对或通过优化序列全序列的清单上的替代损失函数来处理。在这项工作中，我们提出MidRank，它从中等大小的子序列中学习。这些子序列包含有用的结构排名信息，从而在训练期间导致更好的可学习性，并且在测试期间更好地泛化。通过利用子序列，所提出的MidRank在广泛的图像排名应用程序和数据集上显着提高了排序精度。
