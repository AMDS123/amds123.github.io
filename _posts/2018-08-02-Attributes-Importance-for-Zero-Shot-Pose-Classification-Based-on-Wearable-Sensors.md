##### Abstract
This paper presents a simple yet effective method for improving the performance of zero-shot learning (ZSL). ZSL classifies instances of unseen classes, from which no training data is available, by utilizing the attributes of the classes. Conventional ZSL methods have equally dealt with all the available attributes, but this sometimes causes misclassification. This is because an attribute that is effective for classifying instances of one class is not always effective for another class. In this case, a metric of classifying the latter class can be undesirably influenced by the irrelevant attribute. This paper solves this problem by taking the importance of each attribute for each class into account when calculating the metric. In addition to the proposal of this new method, this paper also contributes by providing a dataset for pose classification based on wearable sensors, named HDPoseDS. It contains 22 classes of poses performed by 10 subjects with 31 IMU sensors across full body. To the best of our knowledge, it is the richest wearable-sensor dataset especially in terms of sensor density, and thus it is suitable for studying zero-shot pose/action recognition. The presented method was evaluated on HDPoseDS and outperformed relative improvement of 5.9% in comparison to the best baseline method.

##### Abstract (translated by Google)
本文提出了一种简单而有效的方法来提高零射击学习（ZSL）的性能。 ZSL利用类的属性对未见过的类的实例进行分类，从中没有可用的训练数据。传统的ZSL方法同样处理所有可用属性，但这有时会导致错误分类。这是因为对一个类的实例进行分类有效的属性对另一个类并不总是有效。在这种情况下，对后一类进行分类的度量可能会受到不相关属性的不利影响。本文通过在计算度量时考虑每个类的每个属性的重要性来解决此问题。除了这种新方法的提议之外，本文还提供了一种基于可穿戴传感器的姿势分类数据集，名为HDPoseDS。它包含由10个受试者执行的22类姿势，其中31个IMU传感器穿过全身。据我们所知，它是最丰富的可穿戴传感器数据集，特别是在传感器密度方面，因此它适用于研究零射击姿势/动作识别。所提出的方法在HDPoseDS上进行评估，与最佳基线方法相比，优于5.9％的相对改善。
