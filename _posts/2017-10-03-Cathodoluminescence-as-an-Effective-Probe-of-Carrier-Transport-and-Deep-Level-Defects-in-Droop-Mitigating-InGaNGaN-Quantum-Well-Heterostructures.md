##### Abstract
Commercial InGaN/GaN light emitting diode heterostructures continue to suffer from efficiency droop at high current densities. Droop mitigation strategies target Auger recombination and typically require structural and/or compositional changes within the multi-quantum well active region. However, these modifications are often accompanied by a corresponding degradation in material quality that decreases the expected gains in high-current external quantum efficiency. We study origins of these efficiency losses by correlating chip-level quantum efficiency measurements with structural and optical properties obtained using a combination of electron microscopy tools. The drop in quantum efficiency is not found to be correlated with quantum well (QW) width fluctuations. Rather, we show direct correlation between active region design, deep level defects, and delayed electron beam induced cathodoluminescence (CL) with characteristic rise time constants on the order of tens of seconds. We propose a model in which the electron beam fills deep level defect states and simultaneously drives reduction of the built-in field within the multi-quantum well active region, resulting in a delay in accumulation of carrier populations within the QWs. The CL measurements yield fundamental insights into carrier transport phenomena, efficiency-reducing defects, and quantum well band structure that are important in guiding future heterostructure process development.

商业InGaN / GaN发光二极管异质结构在高电流密度下继续受到效率下垂的影响。下垂缓解策略针对俄歇重组，并且通常需要多量子阱活性区域内的结构和/或组成变化。然而，这些修改往往伴随着材料质量的相应降低，这降低了高电流外部量子效率的预期收益。我们通过将芯片级量子效率测量与使用电子显微镜工具组合获得的结构和光学性质相关联来研究这些效率损失的起源。量子效率的下降没有被发现与量子阱（QW）宽度波动相关。相反，我们显示活性区域设计，深层次缺陷和延迟电子束感应阴极发光（CL）之间的直接相关性，其上升时间常数约为几十秒。我们提出了一个模型，在这个模型中，电子束填充深能级缺陷态，同时驱动多量子阱激活区内的内建场的减少，导致QWs内载流子数量的累积延迟。 CL测量结果对载流子传输现象，降低效率的缺陷以及对于指导未来异质结构工艺开发非常重要的量子阱结构产生了基本的见解。
