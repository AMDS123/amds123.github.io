##### Abstract
In this paper, a method to detect environmental hazards related to a fall risk using a mobile vision system is proposed. First-person perspective videos are proposed to provide objective evidence on cause and circumstances of perturbed balance during activities of daily living, targeted to seniors. A classification problem was defined with 12 total classes of potential fall risks, including slope changes (e.g., stairs, curbs, ramps) and surfaces (e.g., gravel, grass, concrete). Data was collected using a chest-mounted GoPro camera. We developed a convolutional neural network for automatic feature extraction, reduction, and classification of frames. Initial results, with a mean square error of 8%, are promising.

本文提出了一种利用移动视觉系统检测与跌倒风险有关的环境危害的方法。提出第一人称视角视频，以针对老年人为对象，提供日常生活活动中平衡紊乱的原因和情况的客观证据。分类问题被定义为包括坡度变化（例如，楼梯，路缘，坡道）和表面（例如，砾石，草地，混凝土）在内的12类潜在下降风险。数据使用胸部安装的GoPro相机收集。我们开发了卷积神经网络，用于帧的自动特征提取，缩减和分类。初始结果的均方误差为8％，是有希望的。
