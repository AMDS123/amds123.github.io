##### Abstract
The recent phenomenal interest in convolutional neural networks (CNNs) must have made it inevitable for the super-resolution (SR) community to explore its potential. The response has been immense and in the last three years, since the advent of the pioneering work, there appeared too many works not to warrant a comprehensive survey. This paper surveys the SR literature in the context of deep learning. We focus on the three important aspects of multimedia - namely image, video and multi-dimensions, especially depth maps. In each case, first relevant benchmarks are introduced in the form of datasets and state of the art SR methods, excluding deep learning. Next is a detailed analysis of the individual works, each including a short description of the method and a critique of the results with special reference to the benchmarking done. This is followed by minimum overall benchmarking in the form of comparison on some common dataset, while relying on the results reported in various works.

##### Abstract (translated by Google)
卷积神经网络（CNN）最近的显着兴趣必定使超分辨率（SR）社区不可避免地探索其潜力。反应巨大，近三​​年来，从开创性的工作出现以来，出现了太多的作品，不值得进行全面的调查。本文在深度学习的背景下对SR文献进行了调查。我们关注多媒体的三个重要方面 - 即图像，视频和多维度，尤其是深度图。在每种情况下，首先相关的基准以数据集和先​​进的SR方法的形式引入，不包括深度学习。接下来是对个别作品的详细分析，每个作品都包含对方法的简短描述，并对结果进行批评，并特别参考所做的基准。其次是对一些常用数据集进行比较的最低总体基准，同时依靠各种作品中报告的结果。
