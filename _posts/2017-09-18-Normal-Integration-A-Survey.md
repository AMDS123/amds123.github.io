##### Abstract
The need for efficient normal integration methods is driven by several computer vision tasks such as shape-from-shading, photometric stereo, deflectometry, etc. In the first part of this survey, we select the most important properties that one may expect from a normal integration method, based on a thorough study of two pioneering works by Horn and Brooks [28] and by Frankot and Chellappa [19]. Apart from accuracy, an integration method should at least be fast and robust to a noisy normal field. In addition, it should be able to handle several types of boundary condition, including the case of a free boundary, and a reconstruction domain of any shape i.e., which is not necessarily rectangular. It is also much appreciated that a minimum number of parameters have to be tuned, or even no parameter at all. Finally, it should preserve the depth discontinuities. In the second part of this survey, we review most of the existing methods in view of this analysis, and conclude that none of them satisfies all of the required properties. This work is complemented by a companion paper entitled Variational Methods for Normal Integration, in which we focus on the problem of normal integration in the presence of depth discontinuities, a problem which occurs as soon as there are occlusions.

对于高效的法线积分方法的需求是由几个计算机视觉任务驱动的，比如阴影形状，光度立体，偏转法等等。在本次调查的第一部分，我们选择了一个可能期望的正常整合方法的基础上，对霍恩和布鲁克斯[28]和Frankot和Chellappa [19]的两项开拓性工作进行了深入的研究。除了准确性之外，积分方法应该至少对噪声正常的场快速且稳健。此外，它应该能够处理几种类型的边界条件，包括自由边界的情况和任何形状的重建区域，即不一定是矩形的。同样值得赞赏的是，必须调整最少数量的参数，甚至根本没有参数。最后，它应该保留深度不连续性。在本次调查的第二部分，我们回顾了现有的大多数方法，并认为这些方法都不能满足所有的要求。这项工作是由一个题为正态积分的变分方法，其中我们把重点放在存在深度不连续性的正常积分问题，伴随着一个闭塞出现的问题的伴随文件的补充。
