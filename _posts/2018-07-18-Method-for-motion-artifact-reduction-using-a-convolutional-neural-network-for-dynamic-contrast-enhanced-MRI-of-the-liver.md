##### Abstract
Purpose: To improve the quality of images obtained via dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI (DCE-MRI) that include motion artifacts and blurring using a deep learning approach. Methods: A multi-channel convolutional neural network (MARC) based method is proposed for reducing the motion artifacts and blurring caused by respiratory motion in images obtained via DCE-MRI of the liver. The training datasets for the neural network included images with and without respiration-induced motion artifacts or blurring, and the distortions were generated by simulating the phase error in k-space. Patient studies were conducted using a multi-phase T1-weighted spoiled gradient echo sequence for the liver containing breath-hold failures during data acquisition. The trained network was applied to the acquired images to analyze the filtering performance, and the intensities and contrast ratios before and after denoising were compared via Bland-Altman plots. Results: The proposed network was found to significantly reduce the magnitude of the artifacts and blurring induced by respiratory motion, and the contrast ratios of the images after processing via the network were consistent with those of the unprocessed images. Conclusion: A deep learning based method for removing motion artifacts in images obtained via DCE-MRI in the liver was demonstrated and validated.

目的：通过动态对比度增强MRI（DCE-MRI）提高图像质量，包括运动伪影和使用深度学习方法模糊。方法：提出一种基于多通道卷积神经网络（MARC）的方法，用于减少肝脏DCE-MRI获得的图像中由呼吸运动引起的运动伪影和模糊。用于神经网络的训练数据集包括具有和不具有呼吸引起的运动伪影或模糊的图像，并且通过模拟k空间中的相位误差来生成失真。在数据采集期间，使用多相T1加权损坏梯度回波序列对肝脏进行患者研究，其中包含屏气故障。将训练好的网络应用于获取的图像以分析过滤性能，并且通过Bland-Altman图比较去噪前后的强度和对比度。结果：发现所提出的网络显着降低了由呼吸运动引起的伪影和模糊的幅度，并且通过网络处理后的图像的对比度与未处理的图像的对比度一致。结论：通过基于深度学习的方法去除肝脏中通过DCE-MRI获得的图像中的运动伪影，并进行了验证和验证。
