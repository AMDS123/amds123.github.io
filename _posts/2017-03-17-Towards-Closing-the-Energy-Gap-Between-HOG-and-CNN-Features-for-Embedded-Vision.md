##### Abstract
Computer vision enables a wide range of applications in robotics/drones, self-driving cars, smart Internet of Things, and portable/wearable electronics. For many of these applications, local embedded processing is preferred due to privacy and/or latency concerns. Accordingly, energy-efficient embedded vision hardware delivering real-time and robust performance is crucial. While deep learning is gaining popularity in several computer vision algorithms, a significant energy consumption difference exists compared to traditional hand-crafted approaches. In this paper, we provide an in-depth analysis of the computation, energy and accuracy trade-offs between learned features such as deep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and hand-crafted features such as Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG). This analysis is supported by measurements from two chips that implement these algorithms. Our goal is to understand the source of the energy discrepancy between the two approaches and to provide insight about the potential areas where CNNs can be improved and eventually approach the energy-efficiency of HOG while maintaining its outstanding performance accuracy.

计算机视觉使机器人/无人机，自动驾驶汽车，智能物联网和便携式/可穿戴电子设备等应用广泛。对于这些应用中的许多应用，由于隐私和/或延迟问题，本地嵌入式处理是优选的。因此，提供实时和稳健性能的高能效嵌入式视觉硬件至关重要。深度学习在几种计算机视觉算法中越来越受欢迎，但与传统的手工方法相比，存在显着的能耗差异。在本文中，我们深入分析了深度卷积神经网络（CNN）等学习特征与面向方向梯度直方图（HOG）等手工特征之间的计算，能量和精度折衷。这个分析得到了两个芯片的测量结果的支持。我们的目标是了解两种方法之间能量差异的根源，并提供有关CNNs可以改进的潜在领域的见解，并最终接近HOG的能量效率，同时保持其卓越的性能准确性。
