##### Abstract
Sleep apnea is a syndrome that is characterized by sudden breathing halts while sleeping. One of the common treatments involves wearing a mask that delivers continuous air flow into the nostrils so as to maintain a steady air pressure. These masks are designed for an average facial model and are often difficult to adjust due to poor fit to the actual patient. The incompatibility is characterized by gaps between the mask and the face, which deteriorates the impermeability of the mask and leads to air leakage. We suggest a fully automatic approach for designing a personalized nasal mask interface using a facial depth scan. The interfaces generated by the proposed method accurately fit the geometry of the scanned face, and are easy to manufacture. The proposed method utilizes cheap commodity depth sensors and 3D printing technologies to efficiently design and manufacture customized masks for patients suffering from sleep apnea.

睡眠呼吸暂停是一种以睡眠时突然呼吸暂停为特征的综合征。常见的治疗方法之一就是佩戴一个能使气流持续进入鼻孔的面罩，以保持稳定的气压。这些面罩是专为平均面部模型而设计的，由于对实际患者的适应性差，往往难以调整。不相容性的特征是面罩和面部之间的间隙，这会使面罩的不透性变差，并导致漏气。我们建议使用面部深度扫描来设计个性化的鼻面罩界面的全自动方法。所提出的方法所产生的界面精确地符合扫描面的几何形状，并且易于制造。所提出的方法利用便宜的商品深度传感器和3D打印技术来为患有睡眠呼吸暂停的患者有效地设计和制造定制的面罩。
