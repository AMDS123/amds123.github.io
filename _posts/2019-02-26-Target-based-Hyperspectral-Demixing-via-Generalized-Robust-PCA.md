##### Abstract
Localizing targets of interest in a given hyperspectral (HS) image has applications ranging from remote sensing to surveillance. This task of target detection leverages the fact that each material/object possesses its own characteristic spectral response, depending upon its composition. As $\textit{signatures}$ of different materials are often correlated, matched filtering based approaches may not be appropriate in this case. In this work, we present a technique to localize targets of interest based on their spectral signatures. We also present the corresponding recovery guarantees, leveraging our recent theoretical results. To this end, we model a HS image as a superposition of a low-rank component and a dictionary sparse component, wherein the dictionary consists of the $\textit{a priori}$ known characteristic spectral responses of the target we wish to localize. Finally, we analyze the performance of the proposed approach via experimental validation on real HS data for a classification task, and compare it with related techniques.
