##### Abstract
Various forums and question answering (Q&amp;A) sites are available online that allow Ubuntu users to find results similar to their queries. However, searching for a result is often time consuming as it requires the user to find a specific problem instance relevant to his/her query from a large set of questions. In this paper, we present an automated question answering system for Ubuntu users called Dr. Tux that is designed to answer user's queries by selecting the most similar question from an online database. The prototype was implemented in Python and uses NLTK and CoreNLP tools for Natural Language Processing. The data for the prototype was taken from the AskUbuntu website which contains about 150k questions. The results obtained from the manual evaluation of the prototype were promising while also presenting some interesting opportunities for improvement.

在线提供各种论坛和问答（Q＆amp; A）站点，允许Ubuntu用户找到与他们的查询类似的结果。然而，搜索结果通常是耗时的，因为它要求用户从大量问题中找到与他/她的查询相关的特定问题实例。在本文中，我们为Ubuntu用户提供了一个名为Dr. Tux的自动问答系统，旨在通过从在线数据库中选择最相似的问题来回答用户的查询。原型是用Python实现的，并使用NLTK和CoreNLP工具进行自然语言处理。原型的数据来自AskUbuntu网站，其中包含大约150k的问题。从原型的人工评估中获得的结果是有希望的，同时也提出了一些有趣的改进机会。
