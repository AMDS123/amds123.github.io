##### Abstract
In a decentralised knowledge representation system such as the Web of Data, it is common and indeed desirable for different knowledge graphs to overlap. Whenever multiple names are used to denote the same thing, owl:sameAs statements are needed in order to link the data and foster reuse. Whilst the deductive value of such identity statements can be extremely useful in enhancing various knowledge-based systems, incorrect use of identity can have wide-ranging effects in a global knowledge space like the Web of Data. With several works already proven that identity in the Web is broken, this survey investigates the current state of this "sameAs problem". An open discussion highlights the main weaknesses suffered by solutions in the literature, and draws open challenges to be faced in the future.
