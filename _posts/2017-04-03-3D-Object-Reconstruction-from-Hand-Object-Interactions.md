##### Abstract
Recent advances have enabled 3d object reconstruction approaches using a single off-the-shelf RGB-D camera. Although these approaches are successful for a wide range of object classes, they rely on stable and distinctive geometric or texture features. Many objects like mechanical parts, toys, household or decorative articles, however, are textureless and characterized by minimalistic shapes that are simple and symmetric. Existing in-hand scanning systems and 3d reconstruction techniques fail for such symmetric objects in the absence of highly distinctive features. In this work, we show that extracting 3d hand motion for in-hand scanning effectively facilitates the reconstruction of even featureless and highly symmetric objects and we present an approach that fuses the rich additional information of hands into a 3d reconstruction pipeline, significantly contributing to the state-of-the-art of in-hand scanning.

最近的进步使得使用单个现成的RGB-D相机的3D对象重建方法成为可能。虽然这些方法对于广泛的对象类都是成功的，但它们依赖于稳定和独特的几何或纹理特征。然而，像机械零件，玩具，家用或装饰物品的许多物体是无纹理的，并且具有简单和对称的简约形状的特征。现有的手持式扫描系统和三维重建技术在这些对称物体缺乏高度显着特征的情况下失败了。在这项工作中，我们表明，提取3D手部运动的手中扫描有效地促进甚至无特征和高度对称的对象的重建，我们提出了一种方法，融合手的丰富的附加信息到一个三维重建管道，显着贡献最先进的手中扫描。
