##### Abstract
Learning on Grassmann manifold has become popular in many computer vision tasks, with the strong capability to extract discriminative information for imagesets and videos. However, such learning algorithms particularly on high-dimensional Grassmann manifold always involve with significantly high computational cost, which seriously limits the applicability of learning on Grassmann manifold in more wide areas. In this research, we propose an unsupervised dimensionality reduction algorithm on Grassmann manifold based on the Locality Preserving Projections (LPP) criterion. LPP is a commonly used dimensionality reduction algorithm for vector-valued data, aiming to preserve local structure of data in the dimension-reduced space. The strategy is to construct a mapping from higher dimensional Grassmann manifold into the one in a relative low-dimensional with more discriminative capability. The proposed method can be optimized as a basic eigenvalue problem. The performance of our proposed method is assessed on several classification and clustering tasks and the experimental results show its clear advantages over other Grassmann based algorithms.

在Grassmann流形上的学习已经在许多计算机视觉任务中变得流行起来，具有为图像集和视频提取有差别的信息的强大能力。然而，这种高维格拉斯曼流形学习算法总是涉及到很高的计算成本，严重限制了Grassmann流形学习在更广泛领域的适用性。在这项研究中，我们提出了基于局部保持投影（LPP）准则的Grassmann流形上的无监督降维算法。 LPP是矢量值数据的一种常用的降维算法，旨在保持降维空间中数据的局部结构。策略是构造一个从高维Grassmann流形映射到具有更多判别能力的相对低维映射。该方法可以作为一个基本的特征值问题进行优化。我们提出的方法的性能评估在几个分类和聚类任务和实验结果显示其明显优于其他基于Grassmann的算法。
