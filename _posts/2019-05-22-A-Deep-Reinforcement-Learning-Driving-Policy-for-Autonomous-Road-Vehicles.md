##### Abstract
This work regards our preliminary investigation on the problem of path planning for autonomous vehicles that move on a freeway. We approach this problem by proposing a driving policy based on Reinforcement Learning. The proposed policy makes minimal or no assumptions about the environment, since no a priori knowledge about the system dynamics is required. We compare the performance of the proposed policy against an optimal policy derived via Dynamic Programming and against manual driving simulated by SUMO traffic simulator.
