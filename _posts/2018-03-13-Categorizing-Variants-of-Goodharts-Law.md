##### Abstract
There are several distinct failure modes for overoptimization of systems on the basis of metrics. This occurs when a metric which can be used to improve a system is used to an extent that further optimization is ineffective or harmful, and is sometimes termed Goodhart's Law. This class of failure is often poorly understood, partly because terminology for discussing them is ambiguous, and partly because discussion using this ambiguous terminology ignores distinctions between different failure modes of this general type. This paper expands on an earlier discussion by Garrabrant, which notes there are "(at least) four different mechanisms" that relate to Goodhart's Law. This paper is intended to explore these mechanisms further, and specify more clearly how they occur. This discussion should be helpful in better understanding these types of failures in economic regulation, in public policy, in machine learning, and in Artificial Intelligence alignment. The importance of Goodhart effects depends on the amount of power directed towards optimizing the proxy, and so the increased optimization power offered by artificial intelligence makes it especially critical for that field.

##### Abstract (translated by Google)
基于度量标准的系统过度优化有几种不同的失效模式。这发生在可以用来改进系统的度量被用于进一步优化无效或有害的程度时，并且有时被称为Goodhart定律。这类失败往往知之甚少，部分原因是因为讨论它们的术语不明确，部分原因是因为使用这种模糊术语的讨论忽略了这种一般类型的不同失效模式之间的区别。本文扩展了Garrabrant先前的讨论，其中指出“至少有四种不同的机制”与古德哈特定律有关。本文旨在进一步探索这些机制，并更明确地指出它们如何发生。这个讨论应该有助于更好地理解经济调控，公共政策，机器学习和人工智能调整中的这些失败类型。 Goodhart效应的重要性取决于针对优化代理的功率数量，因此人工智能提供的增强的优化功能使其对于该领域尤其重要。
