##### Abstract
We investigate the non-identifiability issues associated with bidirectional adversarial training for joint distribution matching. Within a framework of conditional entropy, we propose both adversarial and non-adversarial approaches to learn desirable matched joint distributions for unsupervised and supervised tasks. We unify a broad family of adversarial models as joint distribution matching problems. Our approach stabilizes learning of unsupervised bidirectional adversarial learning methods. Further, we introduce an extension for semi-supervised learning tasks. Theoretical results are validated in synthetic data and real-world applications.

我们调查与联合分布匹配的双向对抗训练有关的不可识别性问题。在条件熵的框架下，我们提出了对抗和非对抗的方法来学习无监督和监督任务的理想匹配联合分布。我们将广泛的敌对模式族统一为联合分配匹配问题。我们的方法稳定学习无监督双向对抗学习方法。此外，我们引入了半监督学习任务的扩展。理论结果在合成数据和实际应用中得到验证。
