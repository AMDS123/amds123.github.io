##### Abstract
Objects within a category are often similar in their shape and usage. When we---as humans---want to grasp something, we transfer our knowledge from past experiences and adapt it to novel objects. In this paper, we propose a new approach for transferring grasping skills that accumulates grasping knowledge into a category-level canonical model. Grasping motions for novel instances of the category are inferred from geometric deformations between the observed instance and the canonical shape. Correspondences between the shapes are established by means of a non-rigid registration method that combines the Coherent Point Drift approach with subspace methods. By incorporating category-level information into the registration, we avoid unlikely shapes and focus on deformations actually observed within the category. Control poses for generating grasping motions are accumulated in the canonical model from grasping definitions of known objects. According to the estimated shape parameters of a novel instance, the control poses are transformed towards it. The category-level model makes our method particularly relevant for on-line grasping, where fully-observed objects are not easily available. This is demonstrated through experiments in which objects with occluded handles are successfully grasped.

类别中的对象的形状和用法通常相似。当我们 - 作为人类 - 想要掌握某些东西时，我们将我们的知识从过去的经验中转移出来并使其适应新的物体。在本文中，我们提出了一种新的方法，用于转移抓取技能，将掌握的知识积累到类别级别的规范模型中。从观察到的实例和规范形状之间的几何变形推断出该类别的新实例的抓取运动。通过将相干点漂移方法与子空间方法相结合的非刚性配准方法来建立形状之间的对应关系。通过将类别级信息合并到注册中，我们避免了不太可能的形状，并专注于在类别中实际观察到的变形。通过掌握已知对象的定义，在规范模型中累积用于产生抓取运动的控制姿势。根据新实例的估计形状参数，控制姿势向其转换。类别级模型使我们的方法与在线抓取特别相关，其中完全观察到的对象不容易获得。通过实验证明了这一点，其中成功地掌握了具有被遮挡手柄的物体。
