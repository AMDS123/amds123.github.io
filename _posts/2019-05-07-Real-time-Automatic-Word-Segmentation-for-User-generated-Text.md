##### Abstract
For readability and possibly for disambiguation, appropriate word segmentation is recommended for written text. In this paper, we propose a real-time assistive technology that utilizes an automatic segmentation. The language investigated is Korean, a head-final language with various morpho-syllabic blocks as characters. The training scheme is fully neural network-based and straightforward. Besides, we show how the proposed system can be utilized in a web-based real-time revision for a user-generated text. With qualitative and quantitative comparison with widely used text processing toolkits, we show the reliability of the proposed system and how it fits with conversation-style and non-canonical texts. The demonstration is available online.
