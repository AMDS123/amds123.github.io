##### Abstract
Invasive cardiac catheterisation is a common procedure that is carried out before surgical intervention. Yet, invasive cardiac diagnostics are full of risks, especially for young children. Decades of research has been conducted on the so called inverse problem of electrocardiography, which can be used to reconstruct Heart Surface Potentials (HSPs) from Body Surface Potentials (BSPs), for non-invasive diagnostics. State of the art solutions to the inverse problem are unsatisfactory, since the inverse problem is known to be ill-posed. In this paper we propose a novel approach to reconstructing HSPs from BSPs using a Time-Delay Artificial Neural Network (TDANN). We first design the TDANN architecture, and then develop an iterative search space algorithm to find the parameters of the TDANN, which results in the best overall HSP prediction. We use real-world recorded BSPs and HSPs from individuals suffering from serious cardiac conditions to validate our TDANN. The results are encouraging, in that coefficients obtained by correlating the predicted HSP with the recorded patient' HSP approach ideal values.

侵入性心脏导管插入术是手术干预前常见的手术。然而，侵入性心脏诊断充满风险，特别是对于年幼的儿童。数十年的研究已经在所谓的心电图反问题上进行，该问题可以用于从体表电位（BSPs）重建心脏表面电位（HSPs），用于非侵入性诊断。现有技术的解决逆问题的方法是不令人满意的，因为逆问题已知是不适当的。在本文中，我们提出了一种新的方法来重建HSPs使用时间延迟人工神经网络（TDANN）的BSPs。我们首先设计TDANN架构，然后开发一个迭代搜索空间算法来寻找TDANN的参数，从而得到最好的整体HSP预测。我们使用真实记录的BSP和患有严重心脏病的个体的HSP来验证我们的TDANN。结果令人鼓舞，因为通过将预测的HSP与记录的患者的HSP方法理想值相关联而获得系数。
