##### Abstract
As the number of scientific journals has multiplied, journal rankings have become increasingly important for scientific decisions. From submissions and subscriptions to grants and hirings, researchers, policy makers, and funding agencies make important decisions with influence from journal rankings such as the ISI journal impact factor. Typically, the rankings are derived from the citation network between a selection of journals and unavoidably depend on this selection. However, little is known about how robust rankings are to the selection of included journals. Here we compare the robustness of three journal rankings based on network flows induced on citation networks. They model pathways of researchers navigating scholarly literature, stepping between journals and remembering their previous steps to different degree: zero-step memory as impact factor, one-step memory as Eigenfactor, and two-step memory, corresponding to zero-, first-, and second-order Markov models of citation flow between journals. We conclude that higher-order Markov models perform better and are more robust to the selection of journals. Whereas our analysis indicates that higher-order models perform better, the performance gain for the second-order Markov model comes at the cost of requiring more citation data over a longer time period.

随着科学期刊数量的增加，期刊排名对科学决策的重要性日益凸显。研究人员，政策制定者和资助机构从提交和订阅到授予和指定，都会根据ISI期刊影响因子等期刊排名的影响做出重要决策。通常情况下，排名来源于期刊选择之间的引文网络，并且不可避免地依赖于这一选择。然而，人们对包括杂志的选择在内的排名是多么的不了解。在这里，我们比较了基于引用网络引发的网络流量的三个杂志排名的鲁棒性。他们模拟研究人员在学术文献中的路径，在期刊之间走来走去，不同程度地记住他们以前的步骤：作为影响因子的零步记忆，作为特征因子的一步记忆和两步记忆，分别对应于零，和期刊间引用流的二阶马尔科夫模型。我们得出这样的结论：高阶马尔可夫模型表现更好，对期刊的选择也更为强大。而我们的分析表明，高阶模型表现更好，二阶马尔科夫模型的性能增益的代价是需要更长的时间段更多的引用数据。
