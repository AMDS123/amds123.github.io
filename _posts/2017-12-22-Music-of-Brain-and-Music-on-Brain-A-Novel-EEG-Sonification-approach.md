##### Abstract
Can we hear the sound of our brain? Is there any technique which can enable us to hear the neuro-electrical impulses originating from the different lobes of brain? The answer to all these questions is YES. In this paper we present a novel method with which we can sonify the Electroencephalogram (EEG) data recorded in rest state as well as under the influence of a simplest acoustical stimuli - a tanpura drone. The tanpura drone has a very simple yet very complex acoustic features, which is generally used for creation of an ambiance during a musical performance. Hence, for this pilot project we chose to study the correlation between a simple acoustic stimuli (tanpura drone) and sonified EEG data. Till date, there have been no study which deals with the direct correlation between a bio-signal and its acoustic counterpart and how that correlation varies under the influence of different types of stimuli. This is the first of its kind study which bridges this gap and looks for a direct correlation between music signal and EEG data using a robust mathematical microscope called Multifractal Detrended Cross Correlation Analysis (MFDXA). For this, we took EEG data of 10 participants in 2 min 'rest state' (i.e. with white noise) and in 2 min 'tanpura drone' (musical stimulus) listening condition. Next, the EEG signals from different electrodes were sonified and MFDXA technique was used to assess the degree of correlation (or the cross correlation coefficient) between tanpura signal and EEG signals. The variation of {\gamma}x for different lobes during the course of the experiment also provides major interesting new information. Only music stimuli has the ability to engage several areas of the brain significantly unlike other stimuli (which engages specific domains only).

我们能听到我们大脑的声音吗？有什么技术可以使我们听到来自大脑不同部位的神经电脉冲吗？所有这些问题的答案是肯定的。在本文中，我们提出了一种新的方法，我们可以超声脑电图（EEG）的数据记录在休息状态以及在最简单的声学刺激 - 一个tanpura无人机的影响。 tanpura无人机具有非常简单但非常复杂的声学特征，这通常用于在演奏中创造氛围。因此，对于这个试点项目，我们选择研究一个简单的声学刺激（tanpura无人机）和超声EEG数据之间的相关性。到目前为止，还没有研究生物信号与其声学对应物之间的直接相关性，以及在不同类型的刺激的影响下该相关性如何变化。这是第一个类似的研究弥合了这个差距，并寻找一个强大的数学显微镜称为Multifractal去互相关分析（MFDXA）音乐信号和脑电图数据之间的直接相关性。为此，我们在2分钟'静息状态'（即白噪声）和2分钟'tanpura drone'（音乐刺激）监听条件下拍摄了10名参与者的脑电图数据。接下来，对来自不同电极的EEG信号进行超声处理，并使用MFDXA技术来评估tanpura信号与EEG信号之间的相关程度（或相关系数）。在实验过程中，不同叶片的{\ gamma} x的变化也提供了重要的有趣的新信息。只有音乐刺激能够与其他刺激（仅涉及特定领域）显着不同的大脑几个区域。
