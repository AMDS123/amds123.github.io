##### Abstract
In this article, we address the problem of computing adaptive sensorimotor models that can be used for guiding the motion of robotic systems with uncertain action-to-perception relations. The formulation of the uncalibrated sensor-based control problem is first presented, then, various computational methods for building adaptive sensorimotor models are derived and analysed. The proposed methodology is exemplified with two cases of study: (i) shape control of deformable objects with unknown properties, and (ii) soft manipulation of ultrasonic probes with uncalibrated sensors.
