##### Abstract
The concept of optical diffractive neural network (DNN) is proposed recently, which is implemented by a cascaded phase mask architecture. Like an optical computer, the system can perform machine learning tasks such as number digit recognition in an all-optical manner. However, the system can only work under coherent light illumination and the precision requirement in practical experiments is quite high. This paper proposes an optical machine learning framework based on single-pixel imaging (MLSPI). The MLSPI system can perform the same linear pattern recognition task as DNN. Furthermore, it can work under incoherent lighting conditions, has lower experimental complexity and being easily programmable.
