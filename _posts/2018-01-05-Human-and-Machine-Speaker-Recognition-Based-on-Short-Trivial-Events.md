##### Abstract
Trivial events are ubiquitous in human to human conversations, e.g., cough, laugh and sniff. Compared to regular speech, these trivial events are usually short and unclear, thus generally regarded as not speaker discriminative and so are largely ignored by present speaker recognition research. However, these trivial events are highly valuable in some particular circumstances such as forensic examination, as they are less subjected to intentional change, so can be used to discover the genuine speaker from disguised speech. In this paper, we collect a trivial event speech database that involves 75 speakers and 6 types of events, and report preliminary speaker recognition results on this database, by both human listeners and machines. Particularly, the deep feature learning technique recently proposed by our group is utilized to analyze and recognize the trivial events, which leads to acceptable equal error rates (EERs) despite the extremely short durations (0.2-0.5 seconds) of these events. Comparing different types of events, 'hmm' seems more speaker discriminative.

##### Abstract (translated by Google)
平凡的事件在人与人之间的交谈中无处不在，例如咳嗽，笑声和嗅探。与普通话语相比，这些琐碎的事件通常很短而且不清楚，因此一般认为不是说话人的区分，所以目前的说话人识别研究在很大程度上被忽略了。然而，这些琐碎事件在法医检验等特殊情况下是非常有价值的，因为它们较少受到故意改变，所以可以用来从伪装的言语中发现真正的说话者。在本文中，我们收集了一个涉及75个讲话者和6种事件的平凡事件语音数据库，并且通过听众和机器在这个数据库上报告说话者初步识别结果。特别是，我们最近提出的深度特征学习技术被用来分析和识别平凡的事件，尽管这些事件的持续时间极短（0.2-0.5秒），但导致可接受的等误差率（EER）。比较不同类型的事件，“嗯”似乎更多的说话者歧视。
