##### Abstract
Important gains have recently been obtained in object detection by using training objectives that focus on {\em hard negative} examples, i.e., negative examples that are currently rated as positive or ambiguous by the detector. These examples can strongly influence parameters when the network is trained to correct them. Unfortunately, they are often sparse in the training data, and are expensive to obtain. In this work, we show how large numbers of hard negatives can be obtained {\em automatically} by analyzing the output of a trained detector on video sequences. In particular, detections that are {\em isolated in time}, i.e., that have no associated preceding or following detections, are likely to be hard negatives. We describe simple procedures for mining large numbers of such hard negatives (and also hard {\em positives}) from unlabeled video data. Our experiments show that retraining detectors on these automatically obtained examples often significantly improves performance. We present experiments on multiple architectures and multiple data sets, including face detection, pedestrian detection and other object categories.

最近通过使用关注于{\ em hard negative}示例的训练目标在对象检测中获得了重要的增益，即，当前被检测器评定为正或模糊的负面示例。当网络经过训练以纠正它们时，这些示例可以强烈影响参数。不幸的是，它们在训练数据中通常很少，并且获得的成本很高。在这项工作中，我们通过分析视频序列上训练有素的探测器的输出，展示了如何获得大量的硬阴影{\ em em}。特别地，在时间上被隔离的检测，即没有相关联的先前或后续检测的检测，可能是硬性否定。我们描述了从未标记的视频数据中挖掘大量此类硬阴性（以及硬{\ em阳性}）的简单过程。我们的实验表明，这些自动获得的示例上的再训练检测器通常可以显着提高性我们提出了多种架构和多种数据集的实验，包括人脸检测，行人检测和其他对象类别。
