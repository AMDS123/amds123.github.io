##### Abstract
Surveillance system (SS) development requires hi-tech support to prevail over the shortcomings related to the massive quantity of visual information from SSs. Anything but reduced human monitoring became impossible by means of its physical and economic implications, and an advance towards an automated surveillance becomes the only way out. When it comes to a computer vision system, automatic video event comprehension is a challenging task due to motion clutter, event understanding under complex scenes, multilevel semantic event inference, contextualization of events and views obtained from multiple cameras, unevenness of motion scales, shape changes, occlusions and object interactions among lots of other impairments. In recent years, state-of-the-art models for video event classification and recognition include modeling events to discern context, detecting incidents with only one camera, low-level feature extraction and description, high-level semantic event classification, and recognition. Even so, it is still very burdensome to recuperate or label a specific video part relying solely on its content. Principal component analysis (PCA) has been widely known and used, but when combined with other techniques such as the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm its computation becomes more efficient. This chapter introduces advances associated with the concept of Probabilistic PCA (PPCA) analysis of video event and it also aims at looking closely to ways and metrics to evaluate these less intensive EM implementations of PCA and KPCA.

监视系统（SS）的发展需要高科技的支持，以弥补与SS大量的视觉信息有关的缺点。除了减少人体监测之外，任何事情都不可能通过其物理和经济影响来实现，自动监测的进步成为唯一的出路。当涉及到计算机视觉系统时，自动视频事件理解由于运动混乱，复杂场景下的事件理解，多级语义事件推理，从多个摄像机获得的事件和视图的背景化，运动尺度的不均匀性，形状变化，大量其他障碍之间的遮挡和对象相互作用。近年来，视频事件分类和识别的最新模型包括建模事件以识别上下文，仅使用一个摄像机检测事件，低级特征提取和描述，高级语义事件分类和识别。即便如此，依靠其内容来恢复或标记特定的视频部分仍然是非常麻烦的。主成分分析（PCA）已经被广泛的使用，但是当与其他技术例如期望最大化（EM）算法结合时，其计算变得更有效率。本章介绍了与视频事件的概率PCA（PPCA）分析概念相关的进展，并且还旨在仔细研究评估PCA和KPCA的这些不太密集的EM实现的方法和指标。
