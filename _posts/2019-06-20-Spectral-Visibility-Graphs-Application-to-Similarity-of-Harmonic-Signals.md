##### Abstract
Graph theory is emerging as a new source of tools for time series analysis. One promising method is to transform a signal into its visibility graph, a representation which captures many interesting aspects of the signal. Here we introduce the visibility graph for audio spectra and propose a novel representation for audio analysis: the spectral visibility graph degree. Such representation inherently captures the harmonic content of the signal whilst being resilient to broadband noise. We present experiments demonstrating its utility to measure robust similarity between harmonic signals in real and synthesised audio data. The source code is available online.
