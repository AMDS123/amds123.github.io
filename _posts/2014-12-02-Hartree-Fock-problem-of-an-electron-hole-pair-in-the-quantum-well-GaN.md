##### Abstract
We present microscopic calculations of the absorption spectra for GaN/Al(x)Ga(1-x)N quantum well systems. Whereas the quantum well structures with the parabolic law of dispersion exhibit the usual bleaching of an exciton resonance without shifting a spectral position, the significant red-shift of an exciton peak is found with increasing the electron-hole gas density for a wurtzite quantum well. The energy of the exciton resonance for a wurtzite quantum well is found. The obtained results can be explained by the influence of the valence band structure on quantum confinement effects. The optical gain spectrum in the Hartree-Fock approximation and the Sommerfeld enhancement are calculated. A red shift of the gain spectrum in the Hartree-Fock approximation with respect to the Hartree gain spectrum is found.
