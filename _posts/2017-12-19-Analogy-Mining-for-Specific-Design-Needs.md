##### Abstract
Finding analogical inspirations in distant domains is a powerful way of solving problems. However, as the number of inspirations that could be matched and the dimensions on which that matching could occur grow, it becomes challenging for designers to find inspirations relevant to their needs. Furthermore, designers are often interested in exploring specific aspects of a product-- for example, one designer might be interested in improving the brewing capability of an outdoor coffee maker, while another might wish to optimize for portability. In this paper we introduce a novel system for targeting analogical search for specific needs. Specifically, we contribute a novel analogical search engine for expressing and abstracting specific design needs that returns more distant yet relevant inspirations than alternate approaches.

##### Abstract (translated by Google)
在遥远的领域找到类比的灵感是解决问题的有力途径。然而，随着可匹配的灵感数量和可能出现匹配的尺寸的增加，设计师找到与其需求相关的灵感变得具有挑战性。此外，设计师通常有兴趣探索产品的特定方面 - 例如，一个设计师可能有兴趣提高户外咖啡机的酝酿能力，而另一个设计师可能希望优化便携性。在本文中，我们介绍一种针对特定需求的类比搜索的新型系统。具体而言，我们提供了一种新颖的类比搜索引擎，用于表达和抽象具体的设计需求，这些需求将比替代方法返回更遥远但相关的灵感。
