##### Abstract
In recent years, road accidents have increased significantly. One of the major reasons for these accidents, as reported is driver fatigue. Due to continuous and longtime driving, the driver gets exhausted and drowsy which may lead to an accident. Therefore, there is a need for a system to measure the fatigue level of driver and alert him when he/she feels drowsy to avoid accidents. Thus, we propose a system which comprises of a camera installed on the car dashboard. The camera detect the driver's face and observe the alteration in its facial features and uses these features to observe the fatigue level. Facial features include eyes and mouth. Principle Component Analysis is thus implemented to reduce the features while minimizing the amount of information lost. The parameters thus obtained are processed through Support Vector Classifier for classifying the fatigue level. After that classifier output is sent to the alert unit.

近年来，道路交通事故显着增加。这些事故的主要原因之一，据报道是驾驶员疲劳。由于连续长时间的驾驶，驾驶员会感到疲倦和昏昏欲睡，从而导致事故发生。因此，需要一个系统来测量驾驶员的疲劳程度，并在他感到昏昏欲睡时提醒他，以免发生事故。因此，我们提出了一个由安装在汽车仪表盘上的摄像头组成的系统。照相机检测驾驶员的面部并观察其面部特征的改变，并使用这些特征来观察疲劳水平。面部特征包括眼睛和嘴巴。主要组件分析因此被实施以减少特征，同时最小化丢失的信息量。通过支持向量分类器处理由此获得的参数以分类疲劳水平。之后，分类器输出被发送到警报单元。
