##### Abstract
Purpose: Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common cardiac arrhythmia and is correlated with increased morbidity and mortality. It is associated with atrial fibrosis, which may be assessed non-invasively using late gadolinium-enhanced (LGE) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) where scar tissue is visualised as a region of signal enhancement. In this study, we proposed a novel fully automatic pipeline to achieve an accurate and objective atrial scarring segmentation and assessment of LGE MRI scans for the AF patients. Methods: Our fully automatic pipeline uniquely combined: (1) a multi-atlas based whole heart segmentation (MA-WHS) to determine the cardiac anatomy from an MRI Roadmap acquisition which is then mapped to LGE MRI, and (2) a super-pixel and supervised learning based approach to delineate the distribution and extent of atrial scarring in LGE MRI. Results: Both our MA-WHS and atrial scarring segmentation showed accurate delineations of cardiac anatomy (mean Dice = 89%) and atrial scarring (mean Dice =79%) respectively compared to the established ground truth from manual segmentation. Compared with previously studied methods with manual interventions, our innovative pipeline demonstrated comparable results, but was computed fully automatically. Conclusion: The proposed segmentation methods allow LGE MRI to be used as an objective assessment tool for localisation, visualisation and quantification of atrial scarring.

目的：心房颤动（AF）是最常见的心律失常，与发病率和死亡率增加有关。它与心房纤维化相关，可以使用晚期钆增强（LGE）磁共振成像（MRI）非侵入性地评估疤痕组织作为信号增强区域的可视化。在这项研究中，我们提出了一种新颖的全自动管道，实现准确客观的心房瘢痕形成分割和AF患者的LGE MRI扫描评估。方法：我们的全自动管道独特地结合：（1）基于多图谱的全心脏分割（MA-WHS），以从MRI路径图采集确定心脏解剖结构，然后将其映射到LGE MRI;以及（2）像素和监督学习为基础的方法来描绘LGE MRI中心房瘢痕形成的分布和范围。结果：与手工分割所确定的基础事实相比，我们的MA-WHS和心房瘢痕分割分别显示了心脏解剖学（平均骰子= 89％）和心房瘢痕形成（平均骰子= 79％）的精确描绘。与以前研究过的手动干预方法相比，我们的创新管道具有可比较的结果，但是完全自动计算。结论：所提出的分割方法允许LGE MRI被用作定位，可视化和量化房性疤痕的客观评估工具。
