##### Abstract
Collectiveness motions of crowd systems have attracted a great deal of attentions in recently years. In this paper, we try to measure the collectiveness of a crowd system by the proposed node clique learning method. The proposed method is a graph based method, and investigates the influence from one node to other nodes. A node is represented by a set of nodes which named a clique, which is obtained by spreading information from this node to other nodes in graph. Then only nodes with sufficient information are selected as the clique of this node. The motion coherence between two nodes is defined by node cliques comparing. The collectiveness of a node and the collectiveness of the crowd system are defined by the nodes coherence. Self-driven particle (SDP) model and the crowd motion database are used to test the ability of the proposed method in measuring collectiveness.

人群系统的集体运动近年来备受关注。在本文中，我们试图通过提出的节点集体学习方法来衡量人群系统的集体性。所提出的方法是一个基于图的方法，并调查从一个节点到其他节点的影响。一个节点由一组名为节点的节点表示，该节点通过将信息从该节点传播到图中的其他节点而获得。那么只有具有足够信息的节点被选为该节点的集团。两个节点之间的运动一致性由节点派系比较定义。节点的集体性和人群系统的集体性由节点的连贯性来定义。使用自驱动粒子（SDP）模型和人群运动数据库来测试所提出的方法在测量集体性方面的能力。
