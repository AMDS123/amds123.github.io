##### Abstract
Skin Segmentation is widely used in biometric applications such as face detection, face recognition, face tracking, and hand gesture recognition. However, several challenges such as nonlinear illumination, equipment effects, personal interferences, ethnicity variations, etc., are involved in detection process that result in the inefficiency of color based methods. Even though many ideas have already been proposed, the problem has not been satisfactorily solved yet. This paper introduces a technique that addresses some limitations of the previous works. The proposed algorithm consists of three main steps including initial seed generation of skin map, Otsu segmentation in color images, and finally a two-stage diffusion. The initial seed of skin pixels is provided based on the idea of ternary image as there are certain pixels in images which are associated to human complexion with very high probability. The Otsu segmentation is performed on several color channels in order to identify homogeneous regions. The result accompanying with the edge map of the image is utilized in two consecutive diffusion steps in order to annex initially unidentified skin pixels to the seed. Both quantitative and qualitative results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed system in compare with the state-of-the-art works.

##### Abstract (translated by Google)
皮肤分割被广泛应用于生物识别应用，例如人脸检测，人脸识别，人脸跟踪和手势识别。然而，非线性照明，设备效应，个人干扰，种族变异等诸多挑战都与检测过程有关，导致基于颜色的方法效率低下。尽管已经提出了很多想法，但问题还没有得到很好的解决。本文介绍了一种解决以前工作的一些限制的技术。该算法由三个主要步骤组成，包括皮肤图的初始种子生成，彩色图像中的Otsu分割以及两级扩散。基于三元图像的思想，提供了皮肤像素的初始种子，因为图像中的某些像素与人类肤色具有很高的概率相关联。在几个颜色通道上执行Otsu分割以识别均匀区域。在两个连续的扩散步骤中利用伴随图像的边缘图的结果，以便将最初未识别的皮肤像素附加到种子。定量和定性的结果都证明了所提出的系统与最先进的作品相比的有效性。
