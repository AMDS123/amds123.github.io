##### Abstract
Studies of the overall structure of vocabulary and its dynamics became possible due to creation of diachronic text corpora, especially Google Books Ngram. This article discusses the question of core change rate and the degree to which the core words cover the texts. Different periods of the last three centuries and six main European languages presented in Google Books Ngram are compared. The main result is high stability of core change rate, which is analogous to stability of the Swadesh list.

由于创造了历时性文本语料库，特别是Google Books Ngram，对词汇的整体结构及其动态的研究成为可能。本文讨论核心变化率的问题以及核心词汇覆盖文本的程度。最近三个世纪的不同时期以及Google Books Ngram中的六种主要欧洲语言进行了比较。主要结果是核心变化率的稳定性很高，类似于斯瓦迪沙列表的稳定性。
