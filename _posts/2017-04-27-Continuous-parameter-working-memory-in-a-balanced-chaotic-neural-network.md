##### Abstract
It has been proposed that neural noise in the cortex arises from chaotic dynamics in the balanced state: in this model of cortical dynamics, the excitatory and inhibitory inputs to each neuron approximately cancel, and activity is driven by fluctuations of the synaptic inputs around their mean. It remains unclear whether neural networks in the balanced state can perform tasks that are highly sensitive to noise, such as storage of continuous parameters in working memory, while also accounting for the irregular behavior of single neurons. Here we show that continuous parameter working memory can be maintained in the balanced state, in a neural circuit with a simple network architecture. We show analytically that in the limit of an infinite network, the dynamics generated by this architecture are characterized by a continuous set of steady balanced states, allowing for the indefinite storage of a continuous parameter. In finite networks, we show that the chaotic noise drives diffusive motion along the approximate attractor, which gradually degrades the stored memory. We analyze the dynamics and show that the slow diffusive motion induces slowly decaying temporal cross correlations in the activity, which differ substantially from those previously described in the balanced state. We calculate the diffusivity, and show that it is inversely proportional to the system size. For large enough (but realistic) neural population sizes, and with suitable tuning of the network connections, the proposed balanced network can sustain continuous parameter values in memory over time scales larger by several orders of magnitude than the single neuron time scale.

已经提出，皮层中的神经噪声来自平衡状态下的混沌动力学：在这种皮质动力学模型中，每个神经元的兴奋性和抑制性输入近似抵消，并且活动由突触输入在其平均值周围的波动驱动。目前尚不清楚平衡状态神经网络是否能够完成对噪声高度敏感的任务，如连续参数在工作记忆中的存储，同时也解释了单个神经元的不规则行为。在这里我们表明连续参数工作记忆可以维持在平衡状态，在一个简单的网络结构的神经回路中。我们通过分析显示，在无限网络的极限下，由这种结构产生的动力学特征是一组连续稳定的平衡状态，允许连续参数的无限存储。在有限的网络中，我们表明混沌噪声驱动沿着近似吸引子的扩散运动，逐渐降低存储的内存。我们分析动力学，并显示缓慢的扩散运动引起缓慢衰减的时间交叉相关的活动，这大大不同于以前描述的平衡状态。我们计算扩散系数，并显示它与系统大小成反比。对于足够大的（但是现实的）神经群体大小以及对网络连接的适当调整，所提出的平衡网络可以在比单个神经元时间尺度大几个数量级的时间尺度上维持存储器中的连续参数值。
