##### Abstract
This paper presents Mixed Formal Learning, a new architecture that learns models based on formal mathematical representations of the domain of interest and exposes latent variables. The second element in the architecture learns a particular skill, typically by using traditional prediction or classification mechanisms. Our key findings include that this architecture: (1) Facilitates transparency by exposing key latent variables based on a learned mathematical model; (2) Enables Low Shot and Zero Shot training of machine learning without sacrificing accuracy or recall.
