##### Abstract
While low-level image features have proven to be effective representations for visual recognition tasks such as object recognition and scene classification, they are inadequate to capture complex semantic meaning required to solve high-level visual tasks such as multimedia event detection and recognition. Recognition or retrieval of events and activities can be improved if specific discriminative objects are detected in a video sequence. In this paper, we propose an image representation, called Detection Bank, based on the detection images from a large number of windowed object detectors where an image is represented by different statistics derived from these detections. This representation is extended to video by aggregating the key frame level image representations through mean and max pooling. We empirically show that it captures complementary information to state-of-the-art representations such as Spatial Pyramid Matching and Object Bank. These descriptors combined with our Detection Bank representation significantly outperforms any of the representations alone on TRECVID MED 2011 data.

虽然低级别的图像特征被证明是视觉识别任务（如物体识别和场景分类）的有效表示，但是它们不足以捕捉解决高级视觉任务（如多媒体事件检测和识别）所需的复杂语义含义。如果在视频序列中检测到特定的区分对象，则可以改善事件和活动的识别或检索。在本文中，我们提出了一个图像表示，称为检测库，基于检测图像从大量的窗口对象检测器，其中图像是由这些检测得出不同的统计数据表示。这种表示通过聚合关键帧级图像表示通过平均值和最大值池来扩展到视频。我们凭经验表明，它捕获了补充信息，如空间金字塔匹配和对象银行等最先进的表示形式。这些描述符与我们的检测库表示法结合在一起，显着优于TRECVID MED 2011数据上的任何表示。
