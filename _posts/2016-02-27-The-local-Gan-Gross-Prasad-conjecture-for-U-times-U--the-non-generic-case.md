##### Abstract
In this paper, we investigate the local Gan-Gross-Prasad conjecture for some pair of representations of $U(3)\times U(2)$ involving a non-generic representation. For a pair of generic $L$-parameters of $(U(n),U(n-1))$, it is known that there is a unique pair of representations in their associateed Vogan $L$-packets which produces the unique Bessel model of these $L$-parameters. We showed that this is not ture for some pair of $L$-parameters involving a non-generic one. On the other hand, we give the precise local theta correspondence for $(U(1),U(3))$ not at the level of $L$-parameters but of individual representations in the framework of the local Langlands correspondence for unitary group. As an applicaiton of these results, we prove an analog of Ichino-Ikeda local conjecture for some non-tempered case.
