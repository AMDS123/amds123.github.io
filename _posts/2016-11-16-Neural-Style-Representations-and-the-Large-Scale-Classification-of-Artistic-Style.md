##### Abstract
The artistic style of a painting is a subtle aesthetic judgment used by art historians for grouping and classifying artwork. The recently introduced `neural-style' algorithm substantially succeeds in merging the perceived artistic style of one image or set of images with the perceived content of another. In light of this and other recent developments in image analysis via convolutional neural networks, we investigate the effectiveness of a `neural-style' representation for classifying the artistic style of paintings.

##### Abstract (translated by Google)
画的艺术风格是艺术史家用于艺术品分组和分类的微妙美学判断。最近推出的“神经风格”算法大大成功地将一个图像或一组图像的感知艺术风格与另一个图像的感知内容合并。鉴于这种以及其他最近在卷积神经网络图像分析方面的发展，我们研究了“神经风格”表征对绘画艺术风格进行分类的有效性。
