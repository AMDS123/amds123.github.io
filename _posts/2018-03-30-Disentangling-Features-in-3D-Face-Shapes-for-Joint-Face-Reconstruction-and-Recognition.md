##### Abstract
This paper proposes an encoder-decoder network to disentangle shape features during 3D face reconstruction from single 2D images, such that the tasks of reconstructing accurate 3D face shapes and learning discriminative shape features for face recognition can be accomplished simultaneously. Unlike existing 3D face reconstruction methods, our proposed method directly regresses dense 3D face shapes from single 2D images, and tackles identity and residual (i.e., non-identity) components in 3D face shapes explicitly and separately based on a composite 3D face shape model with latent representations. We devise a training process for the proposed network with a joint loss measuring both face identification error and 3D face shape reconstruction error. To construct training data we develop a method for fitting 3D morphable model (3DMM) to multiple 2D images of a subject. Comprehensive experiments have been done on MICC, BU3DFE, LFW and YTF databases. The results show that our method expands the capacity of 3DMM for capturing discriminative shape features and facial detail, and thus outperforms existing methods both in 3D face reconstruction accuracy and in face recognition accuracy.

本文提出了一种编码器 - 解码器网络，用于从单个二维图像中分离三维人脸重建过程中的形状特征，从而可以同时完成重建精确的三维人脸形状和学习识别形状特征的任务。与现有的三维人脸重建方法不同，我们提出的方法直接从单个二维图像中回归密集的三维人脸形状，并基于复合三维人脸形状模型明确地分别处理三维人脸形状中的身份和残差（即非同一性）潜在的表示。我们针对所提出的网络设计了训练过程，其具有测量脸部识别误差和3D脸部形状重建误差的联合损失。为了构建训练数据，我们开发了一种将3D形变模型（3DMM）拟合到对象的多个2D图像的方法。 MICC，BU3DFE，LFW和YTF数据库已经完成了全面的实验。结果表明，该方法扩展了3DMM在识别形状特征和面部细节方面的能力，因此在3D人脸重建精度和人脸识别精度方面优于现有方法。
