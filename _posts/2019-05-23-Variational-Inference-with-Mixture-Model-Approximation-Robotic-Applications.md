##### Abstract
We propose a method to approximate the distribution of robot configurations satisfying multiple objectives. Our approach uses Variational Inference, a popular method in Bayesian computation, which has several advantages over sampling-based techniques. To be able to represent the complex and multimodal distribution of configurations, we propose to use a mixture model as approximate distribution, an approach that has gained popularity recently. In this work, we show the interesting properties of this approach and how it can be applied to a range of problems.
