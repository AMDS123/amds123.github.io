##### Abstract
Accurate and reliable segmentation of catheters in MR-gui- ded interventions remains a challenge, and a step of critical importance in clinical workflows. In this work, under reasonable assumptions, me- chanical model based heuristics guide the segmentation process allows correct catheter identification rates greater than 98% (error 2.88 mm), and reduction in outliers to one-fourth compared to the state of the art. Given distal tips, searching towards the proximal ends of the catheters is guided by mechanical models that are estimated on a per-catheter basis. Their bending characteristics are used to constrain the image fea- ture based candidate points. The final catheter trajectories are hybrid sequences of individual points, each derived from model and image fea- tures. We evaluate the method on a database of 10 patient MRI scans including 101 manually segmented catheters. The mean errors were 1.40 mm and the median errors were 1.05 mm. The number of outliers devi- ating more than 2 mm from the gold standard is 7, and the number of outliers deviating more than 3 mm from the gold standard is just 2.

准确和可靠的MR导管介入分割仍然是一个挑战，也是临床工作流程中至关重要的一步。在这项工作中，在合理的假设下，基于机械模型的启发式指导分割过程允许正确的导管识别率大于98％（误差2.88mm），并且与现有技术相比将异常值减少到四分之一。在给定远端尖端的情况下，朝向导管的近端搜索由在每根导管的基础上估计的机械模型指导。它们的弯曲特性被用来约束基于图像特征的候选点。最后的导管轨迹是单个点的混合序列，每个点都来源于模型和图像特征。我们对包括101个手动分割导管的10个患者MRI扫描的数据库评估所述方法。平均误差为1.40mm，中位误差为1.05mm。与黄金标准相差超过2毫米的异常数量是7个，离黄金标准超过3毫米的异常数量仅为2个。
