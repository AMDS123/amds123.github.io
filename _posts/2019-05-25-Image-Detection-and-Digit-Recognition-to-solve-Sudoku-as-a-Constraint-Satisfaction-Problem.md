##### Abstract
Sudoku is a puzzle well-known to the scientific community with simple rules of completion, which may require a com-plex line of reasoning. This paper addresses the problem of partitioning the Sudoku image into a 1-D array, recognizing digits from the array and representing it as a Constraint Sat-isfaction Problem (CSP). In this paper, we introduce new fea-ture extraction techniques for recognizing digits, which are used with our benchmark classifiers in conjunction with the CSP algorithms to provide performance assessment. Experi-mental results show that application of CSP techniques can decrease the solution's search time by eliminating incon-sistent values from the search space.
