##### Abstract
Theories of rough mereology have originated from diverse semantic considerations from contexts relating to study of databases, to human reasoning. These ideas of origin, especially in the latter context, are intensely complex. In this research, concepts of rough contact relations are introduced and rough mereologies are situated in relation to general spatial mereology by the present author. These considerations are restricted to her rough mereologies that seek to avoid contamination.
