##### Abstract
The current mainstream approach to train natural language systems is to expose them to large amounts of text. This passive learning is problematic if we are interested in developing interactive machines, such as conversational agents. We propose a framework for language learning that relies on multi-agent communication. We study this learning in the context of referential games. In these games, a sender and a receiver see a pair of images. The sender is told one of them is the target and is allowed to send a message from a fixed, arbitrary vocabulary to the receiver. The receiver must rely on this message to identify the target. Thus, the agents develop their own language interactively out of the need to communicate. We show that two networks with simple configurations are able to learn to coordinate in the referential game. We further explore how to make changes to the game environment to cause the "word meanings" induced in the game to better reflect intuitive semantic properties of the images. In addition, we present a simple strategy for grounding the agents' code into natural language. Both of these are necessary steps towards developing machines that are able to communicate with humans productively.

目前培养自然语言系统的主流方法是将其暴露给大量的文本。如果我们有兴趣开发交互式机器，比如会话代理，这种被动学习是有问题的。我们提出了一个依赖于多智能体通信的语言学习框架。我们在参考游戏的背景下学习这个学习。在这些游戏中，发送者和接收者看到一对图像。发送者被告知其中一个是目标，并且被允许从固定的任意词汇表向接收者发送消息。接收者必须依靠这个消息来识别目标。因此，代理人以互动的方式开发自己的语言，从而不需要沟通。我们展示了两个简单配置的网络能够学习在参考游戏中进行协调。我们进一步探索如何改变游戏环境，使游戏中的“词义”更好地反映图像的直观语义属性。另外，我们提出了一个将代理人的代码编入自然语言的简单策略。这两者都是开发能够有效地与人沟通的机器的必要步骤。
