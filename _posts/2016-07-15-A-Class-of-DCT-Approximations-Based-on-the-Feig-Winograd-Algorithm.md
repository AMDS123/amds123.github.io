##### Abstract
A new class of matrices based on a parametrization of the Feig-Winograd factorization of 8-point DCT is proposed. Such parametrization induces a matrix subspace, which unifies a number of existing methods for DCT approximation. By solving a comprehensive multicriteria optimization problem, we identified several new DCT approximations. Obtained solutions were sought to possess the following properties: (i) low multiplierless computational complexity, (ii) orthogonality or near orthogonality, (iii) low complexity invertibility, and (iv) close proximity and performance to the exact DCT. Proposed approximations were submitted to assessment in terms of proximity to the DCT, coding performance, and suitability for image compression. Considering Pareto efficiency, particular new proposed approximations could outperform various existing methods archived in literature.

提出了基于8点DCT的Feig-Winograd因子分解参数化的一类新的矩阵。这种参数化导致了一个矩阵子空间，它统一了一些现有的DCT逼近方法。通过解决全面的多准则优化问题，我们确定了几个新的DCT近似值。所获得的解决方案被认为具有以下特性：（i）低乘法器计算复杂性，（ii）正交性或接近正交性，（iii）低复杂性可逆性，以及（iv）与精确DCT紧密接近和性能。拟议的近似值被提交到DCT的邻近性，编码性能和图像压缩的适用性评估。考虑到帕累托效率，特定的新提出的近似值可能胜过现有文献中存在的各种方法。
