##### Abstract
In Japan, inspection of irrigation water canals has been mostly conducted manually. However, the huge demand for more regular inspections as infrastructure ages, coupled with the limited time window available for inspection, has rendered manual inspection increasingly insufficient. With shortened inspection time and reduced labor cost, automated inspection using a combination of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and ground vehicles (cars) has emerged as an attractive alternative to manual inspection. In this paper, we propose a path planning framework that generates optimal plans for UAVs and cars to inspect water canals in a large agricultural area (tens of square kilometers). In addition to optimality, the paths need to satisfy several constraints, in order to guarantee UAV navigation safety and to abide by local traffic regulations. In the proposed framework, the canal and road networks are first modeled as two graphs, which are then partitioned into smaller subgraphs that can be covered by a given fleet of UAVs within one battery charge. The problem of finding optimal paths for both UAVs and cars on the graphs, subject to the constraints, is formulated as a mixed-integer quadratic program (MIQP). The proposed framework can also quickly generate new plans when a current plan is interrupted. The effectiveness of the proposed framework is validated by simulation results showing the successful generation of plans covering all given canal segments, and the ability to quickly revise the plan when conditions change.

在日本，灌溉水渠的检查大多是人工进行的。然而，随着基础设施年限的增加，对更多定期检查的巨大需求，加上可供检查的有限时间窗口，人工检查日益不足。随着检查时间的缩短和劳动力成本的降低，使用无人机（UAV）和地面车辆（汽车）组合的自动检查已成为人工检查的有吸引力的替代方案。在本文中，我们提出了一个路径规划框架，该框架为无人机和汽车在大型农业区域（几十平方公里）内检查水管提供了最佳计划。除了最优化之外，路径还需要满足几个约束条件，以保证无人机的导航安全并遵守当地的交通法规。在所提出的框架中，运河和道路网络首先被建模为两个图形，然后被划分成更小的子图，在一个电池充电的情况下可以被给定的无人机队覆盖。在约束条件下，为图上的无人机和汽车寻找最佳路径的问题被表述为混合整数二次程序（MIQP）。当目前的计划中断时，拟议的框架也可以迅速产生新的计划。拟议框架的有效性通过仿真结果进行验证，该结果显示成功生成涵盖所有给定运河细分市场的计划，以及在情况发生变化时快速修订计划的能力。
