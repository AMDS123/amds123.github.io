##### Abstract
Implementing color constancy as a pre-processing step in contemporary digital cameras is of significant importance as it removes the influence of scene illumination on object colors. Several benchmark color constancy datasets have been created for the purpose of developing and testing new color constancy methods. However, they all have numerous drawbacks including a small number of images, erroneously extracted ground-truth illuminations, long histories of misuses, violations of their stated assumptions, etc. To overcome such and similar problems, in this paper a color constancy benchmark dataset generator is proposed. For a given camera sensor it enables generation of any number of realistic raw images taken in a subset of the real world, namely images of printed photographs. Datasets with such images share many positive features with other existing real-world datasets, while some of the negative features are completely eliminated. The generated images can be successfully used to train methods that afterward achieve high accuracy on real-world datasets. This opens the way for creating large enough datasets for advanced deep learning techniques. Experimental results are presented and discussed.
