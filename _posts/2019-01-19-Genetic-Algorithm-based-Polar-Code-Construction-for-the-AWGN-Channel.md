##### Abstract
We propose a new polar code construction framework (i.e., selecting the frozen bit positions) for the additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channel, tailored to a given decoding algorithm, rather than based on the (not necessarily optimal) assumption of successive cancellation (SC) decoding. The proposed framework is based on the Genetic Algorithm (GenAlg), where populations (i.e., collections) of information sets evolve successively via evolutionary transformations based on their individual error-rate performance. These populations converge towards an information set that fits the decoding behavior. Using our proposed algorithm, we construct a polar code of length 2048 with code rate 0.5, without the CRC-aid, tailored to plain successive cancellation list (SCL) decoding, achieving the same error-rate performance as the CRC-aided SCL decoding, and leading to a coding gain of 1 dB at BER of $10^{-6}$. Further, a belief propagation (BP)-tailored polar code approaches the SCL error-rate performance without any modifications in the decoding algorithm itself.
