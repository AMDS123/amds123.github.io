##### Abstract
We computed linguistic information at the lexical, syntactic, and semantic levels for Recognizing Inference in Text (RITE) tasks for both traditional and simplified Chinese in NTCIR-9 and NTCIR-10. Techniques for syntactic parsing, named-entity recognition, and near synonym recognition were employed, and features like counts of common words, statement lengths, negation words, and antonyms were considered to judge the entailment relationships of two statements, while we explored both heuristics-based functions and machine-learning approaches. The reported systems showed robustness by simultaneously achieving second positions in the binary-classification subtasks for both simplified and traditional Chinese in NTCIR-10 RITE-2. We conducted more experiments with the test data of NTCIR-9 RITE, with good results. We also extended our work to search for better configurations of our classifiers and investigated contributions of individual features. This extended work showed interesting results and should encourage further discussion.

我们在NTCIR-9和NTCIR-10中为传统语言和简体中文的文本推理（RITE）任务计算了词汇，句法和语义层面的语言信息。采用句法分析，命名实体识别和近似同义词识别等技术，对常见词，语句长度，否定词，反义词等词语的特征进行判断，以判断两个语句的包含关系，同时探索启发式 - 基于功能的机器学习方法。所报告的系统在NTCIR-10 RITE-2中通过同时在简化和繁体中文的二分类子任务中获得第二位置显示出鲁棒性。我们对NTCIR-9 RITE的测试数据进行了更多的实验，效果很好。我们还扩展了我们的工作，以寻找更好的配置我们的分类器和调查个人功能的贡献。这个扩展的工作表现出有趣的结果，应该鼓励进一步讨
