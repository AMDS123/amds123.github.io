##### Abstract
Unsupervised learning permits the development of algorithms that are able to adapt to a variety of different data sets using the same underlying rules thanks to the autonomous discovery of discriminating features during training. Recently, a new class of Hebbian-like and local unsupervised learning rules for neural networks have been developed that minimise a similarity matching cost-function. These have been shown to perform sparse representation learning. This study tests the effectiveness of one such learning rule for learning features from images. The rule implemented is derived from a nonnegative classical multidimensional scaling cost-function, and is applied to both single and multi-layer architectures. The features learned by the algorithm are then used as input to an SVM to test their effectiveness in classification on the established CIFAR-10 image dataset. The algorithm performs well in comparison to other unsupervised learning algorithms and multi-layer networks, thus suggesting its validity in the design of a new class of compact, online learning networks.

无监督学习允许开发能够使用相同的基本规则适应各种不同数据集的算法，这要归功于在训练期间自主发现区分特征。最近，已经开发了一类新的类似于Hebbian和局部的神经网络无监督学习规则，使相似性匹配成本函数最小化。已经显示这些进行稀疏表示学习。这项研究测试了一个这样的学习规则从图像学习功能的有效性。所实现的规则是从非负的经典的多维缩放成本函数导出的，并且被应用于单层和多层体系结构。然后将算法学习的特征用作SVM的输入，以测试其在建立的CIFAR-10图像数据集上的分类效果。与其他无监督学习算法和多层网络相比，该算法性能良好，在一类新型紧凑型在线学习网络的设计中表现出了良好的效果。
