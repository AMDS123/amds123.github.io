##### Abstract
Learning meaningful representations using deep neural networks involves designing efficient training schemes and well-structured networks. Currently, the method of stochastic gradient descent that has a momentum with dropout is one of the most popular training protocols. Based on that, more advanced methods (i.e., Maxout and Batch Normalization) have been proposed in recent years, but most still suffer from performance degradation caused by small perturbations, also known as adversarial examples. To address this issue, we propose manifold regularized networks (MRnet) that utilize a novel training objective function that minimizes the difference between multi-layer embedding results of samples and those adversarial. Our experimental results demonstrated that MRnet is more resilient to adversarial examples and helps us to generalize representations on manifolds. Furthermore, combining MRnet and dropout allowed us to achieve competitive classification performances for three well-known benchmarks: MNIST, CIFAR-10, and SVHN.

使用深度神经网络学习有意义的表示包括设计有效的训练方案和结构良好的网络。目前，随机梯度下降方法具有辍学势头是最受欢迎的训练方案之一。基于此，近年来已经提出了更先进的方法（Maxout和Batch Normalization），但是大多数方法仍然遭受由小扰动引起的性能下降，也被称为敌对的例子。为了解决这个问题，我们提出了使用一种新的训练目标函数，使样本的多层嵌入结果和那些对抗性之间的差异最小化的流形正则化网络（MRnet）。我们的实验结果表明，MRnet对对抗性的例子更具有适应性，并且有助于我们在流形上推广表示。此外，结合MRnet和退出使我们能够为三个众所周知的基准：MNIST，CIFAR-10和SVHN实现有竞争力的分类性能。
