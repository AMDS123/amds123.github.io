##### Abstract
Vocal disorders have affected several patients all over the world. Due to the inherent difficulty of diagnosing vocal disorders without sophisticated equipment and trained personnel, a number of patients remain undiagnosed. To alleviate the monetary cost of diagnosis, there has been a recent growth in the use of data analysis to accurately detect and diagnose individuals for a fraction of the cost. We propose a cheap, efficient and accurate model to diagnose whether a patient suffers from one of three vocal disorders on the FEMH 2018 challenge.
