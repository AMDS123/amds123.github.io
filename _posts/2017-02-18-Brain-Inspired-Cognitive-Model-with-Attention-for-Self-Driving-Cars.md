##### Abstract
Perception-driven approach and end-to-end system are two major vision-based frameworks for self-driving cars. However, it is difficult to introduce attention and historical information of autonomous driving process, which are the essential factors for achieving human-like driving into these two methods. In this paper, we propose a novel model for self-driving cars named brain-inspired cognitive model with attention (CMA). This model consists of three parts: a convolutional neural network for simulating human visual cortex, a cognitive map built to describe relationships between objects in complex traffic scene and a recurrent neural network that combines with the real-time updated cognitive map to implement attention mechanism and long-short term memory. The benefit of our model is that can accurately solve three tasks simultaneously:1) detection of the free space and boundaries of the current and adjacent lanes. 2)estimation of obstacle distance and vehicle attitude, and 3) learning of driving behavior and decision making from human driver. More significantly, the proposed model could accept external navigating instructions during an end-to-end driving process. For evaluation, we build a large-scale road-vehicle dataset which contains more than forty thousand labeled road images captured by three cameras on our self-driving car. Moreover, human driving activities and vehicle states are recorded in the meanwhile.

感知驱动的方法和端到端的系统是两种主要的基于视觉的自驾车的框架。然而，将自动驾驶过程的注意和历史信息引入这两种方法是很难实现类人驾驶的关键因素。在本文中，我们提出了一种新颖的自驾式汽车模型，称为脑启发认知模型（CMA）。该模型由三部分组成：一个用于模拟人类视觉皮层的卷积神经网络，一个用于描述复杂交通场景中物体之间关系的认知图谱和一个与实时更新的认知图谱相结合的递归神经网络来实现注意机制和长期的短期记忆。我们的模型的好处是可以同时精确地解决三个任务：1）检测当前和相邻车道的自由空间和边界。 2）障碍物距离和车辆姿态的估计，3）驾驶行为和驾驶员决策的学习。更重要的是，所提出的模型可以在端对端驾驶过程中接受外部导航指令。为了进行评估，我们建立了一个大型道路车辆数据集，其中包含我们的自驾车上三台摄像机拍摄的四万多幅标记的道路图像。此外，还记录了人的驾驶活动和车辆状态。
