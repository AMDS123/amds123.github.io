##### Abstract
Optic disk segmentation is a prerequisite step in automatic retinal screening systems. In this paper, we propose an algorithm for optic disk segmentation based on a local adaptive thresholding method. Location of the optic disk is validated by intensity and average vessel width of retinal images. Then an adaptive thresholding is applied on the temporal and nasal part of the optic disc separately. Adaptive thresholding, makes our algorithm robust to illumination variations and various image acquisition conditions. Moreover, experimental results on the DRIVE and KHATAM databases show promising results compared to the recent literature. In the DRIVE database, the optic disk in all images is correctly located and the mean overlap reached to 43.21%. The optic disk is correctly detected in 98% of the images with the mean overlap of 36.32% in the KHATAM database.

视盘分割是自动视网膜筛查系统的先决条件。在本文中，我们提出了一种基于局部自适应阈值法的光盘分割算法。视盘的位置通过视网膜图像的强度和平均血管宽度来验证。然后自适应阈值分别应用于视盘的颞部和鼻部。自适应阈值处理使得我们的算法对光照变化和各种图像采集条件具有鲁棒性。此外，DRIVE和KHATAM数据库的实验结果显示，与最近的文献相比，前景看好。在DRIVE数据库中，所有图像中的视盘正确定位，平均重叠达到43.21％。 98％的图像在KHATAM数据库中的平均重叠率为36.32％，正确检测到视盘。
