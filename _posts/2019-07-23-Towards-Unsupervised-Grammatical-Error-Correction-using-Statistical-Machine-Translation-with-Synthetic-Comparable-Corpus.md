##### Abstract
We introduce unsupervised techniques based on phrase-based statistical machine translation for grammatical error correction (GEC) trained on a pseudo learner corpus created by Google Translation. We verified our GEC system through experiments on various GEC dataset, includi ng a low resource track of the shared task at Building Educational Applications 2019 (BEA 2019). As a result, we achieved an F_0.5 score of 28.31 points with the test data of the low resource track.
