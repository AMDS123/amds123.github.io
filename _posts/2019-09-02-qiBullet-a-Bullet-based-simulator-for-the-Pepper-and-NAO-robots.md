##### Abstract
The Pepper and NAO robots are widely used for in-store advertizing and education, but also as robotic platforms for research purposes. Their presence in the academic field is expressed through various publications, multiple collaborative projects, and by being the standard platforms of two different RoboCup leagues. Developing, gathering data and training humanoid robots can be tedious: iteratively repeating specific tasks can present risks for the robots, and some environments can be difficult to setup. Software tools allowing to simulate complex environments and the dynamics of robots can thus alleviate that problem, allowing to perform the aforementioned processes on virtual models. One current drawback of the Pepper and NAO platforms is the lack of a physically accurate simulation tool, allowing to test scenarios involving repetitive movements and contacts with the environment on a virtual robot. In this paper, we introduce the qiBullet simulation tool, using the Bullet physics engine to provide such a solution for the Pepper and NAO robots.
