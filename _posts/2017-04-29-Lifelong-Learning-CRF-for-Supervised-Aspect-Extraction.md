##### Abstract
This paper makes a focused contribution to supervised aspect extraction. It shows that if the system has performed aspect extraction from many past domains and retained their results as knowledge, Conditional Random Fields (CRF) can leverage this knowledge in a lifelong learning manner to extract in a new domain markedly better than the traditional CRF without using this prior knowledge. The key innovation is that even after CRF training, the model can still improve its extraction with experiences in its applications.

本文对监督方面提取做出了重点贡献。它表明，如果系统已经从许多过去的领域进行了方面提取，并保留了他们的结果作为知识，条件随机场（CRF）可以利用这种知识终身学习的方式提取一个新的领域明显好于传统的CRF没有使用这个先前的知识。关键的创新之处在于，即使在CRF培训之后，该模型仍然可以借助其应用中的经验来提高其提取。
