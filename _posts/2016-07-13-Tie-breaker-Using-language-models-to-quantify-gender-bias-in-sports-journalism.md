##### Abstract
Gender bias is an increasingly important issue in sports journalism. In this work, we propose a language-model-based approach to quantify differences in questions posed to female vs. male athletes, and apply it to tennis post-match interviews. We find that journalists ask male players questions that are generally more focused on the game when compared with the questions they ask their female counterparts. We also provide a fine-grained analysis of the extent to which the salience of this bias depends on various factors, such as question type, game outcome or player rank.

性别偏见在体育新闻中是一个越来越重要的问题。在这项工作中，我们提出了一种基于语言模型的方法来量化对女性和男性运动员提出的问题的差异，并将其应用于网球赛后面试。我们发现，记者们问男性玩家的问题与他们向女性玩家提出的问题相比，通常更关注游戏。我们还对这种偏见的显着程度取决于诸如问题类型，游戏结果或玩家等级等各种因素的程度进行了细致的分析。
