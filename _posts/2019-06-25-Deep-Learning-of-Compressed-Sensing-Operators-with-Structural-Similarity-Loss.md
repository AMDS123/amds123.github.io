##### Abstract
Compressed sensing (CS) is a signal processing framework for efficiently reconstructing a signal from a small number of measurements, obtained by linear projections of the signal. In this paper we present an end-to-end deep learning approach for CS, in which a fully-connected network performs both the linear sensing and non-linear reconstruction stages. During the training phase, the sensing matrix and the non-linear reconstruction operator are jointly optimized using Structural similarity index (SSIM) as loss rather than the standard Mean Squared Error (MSE) loss. We compare the proposed approach with state-of-the-art in terms of reconstruction quality under both losses, i.e. SSIM score and MSE score.
