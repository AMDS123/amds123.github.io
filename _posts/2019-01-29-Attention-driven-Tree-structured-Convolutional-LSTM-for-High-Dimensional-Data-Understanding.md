##### Abstract
Modeling the sequential information of image sequences has been a vital step of various vision tasks and convolutional long short-term memory (ConvLSTM) has demonstrated its superb performance in such spatiotemporal problems. Nevertheless, the hierarchical data structures in a significant amount of tasks (e.g., human body parts and vessel/airway tree in biomedical images) cannot be properly modeled by sequential models. Thus, ConvLSTM is not suitable for tree-structured image data analysis. In order to address these limitations, we present tree-structured ConvLSTM models for tree-structured image analysis tasks which can be trained end-to-end. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed tree-structured ConvLSTM model, we present a tree-structured segmentation framework which consists of a tree-structured ConvLSTM and an attention fully convolutional network (FCN) model. The proposed framework is extensively validated on four large-scale coronary artery datasets. The results demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed method.
