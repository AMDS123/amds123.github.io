##### Abstract
Reading irregular scene text of arbitrary shape in natural images is still a challenging problem, despite the progress made recently. Many existing approaches incorporate sophisticated network structures to handle various shapes, use extra annotations for stronger supervision, or employ hard-to-train recurrent neural networks for sequence modeling. In this work, we propose a simple yet robust approach for scene text recognition. With no need to convert input images to sequence representations, we directly connect two-dimensional CNN features to an attention-based sequence decoder. As no recurrent module is adopted, our model can be trained in parallel. It achieves 1.7x to 10x acceleration to backward pass and 1.4x to 9x acceleration to forward pass, compared with the RNN counterparts. The proposed model is trained with only word-level annotations. With this simple design, our method achieves state-of-the-art or competitive recognition performance on the evaluated regular and irregular scene text benchmark datasets.
