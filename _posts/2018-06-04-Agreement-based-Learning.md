##### Abstract
Model selection is a problem that has occupied machine learning researchers for a long time. Recently, its importance has become evident through applications in deep learning. We propose an agreement-based learning framework that prevents many of the pitfalls associated with model selection. It relies on coupling the training of multiple models by encouraging them to agree on their predictions while training. In contrast with other model selection and combination approaches used in machine learning, the proposed framework is inspired by human learning. We also propose a learning algorithm defined within this framework which manages to significantly outperform alternatives in practice, and whose performance improves further with the availability of unlabeled data. Finally, we describe a number of potential directions for developing more flexible agreement-based learning algorithms.

模型选择是一个长期以来一直占据机器学习研究人员的问题。最近，它的重要性通过深度学习的应用而变得明显。我们提出了一个基于协议的学习框架，可以防止与模型选择相关的许多缺陷。它依靠多种模式的训练，鼓励他们在训练时达成预测。与机器学习中使用的其他模型选择和组合方法相比，所提出的框架受到人类学习的启发。我们还提出了一种在该框架内定义的学习算法，该算法在实践中显着优于备选方案，并且其性能随着未标记数据的可用性而进一步提高。最后，我们描述了开发更灵活的基于协议的学习算法的一些潜在方向。
