##### Abstract
We present an empirical model for noises in color measurements from OLED displays. According to measured data the noise is not isotropic in the XYZ space, instead most of the noise is along an axis that is parallel to a vector from origin to measured XYZ vector. The presented empirical model is simple and depends only on the measured XYZ values. Our tests show that the variations between multiple panels of the same type have similar distribution as the temporal noise in measurements from a single panel, but a larger magnitude.

我们提出了从OLED显示器的颜色测量噪声的经验模型。根据测量数据，噪声在XYZ空间中不是各向同性的，而是大多数噪声是沿着与从原点到测量XYZ矢量的矢量平行的轴。所提出的经验模型是简单的，只取决于测量的XYZ值。我们的测试表明，相同类型的多个面板之间的变化具有与来自单个面板的测量中的时间噪声相似的分布，但幅度更大。
