##### Abstract
We have developed and trained a convolutional neural network to automatically and simultaneously segment optic disc, fovea and blood vessels. Fundus images were normalised before segmentation was performed to enforce consistency in background lighting and contrast. For every effective point in the fundus image, our algorithm extracted three channels of input from the neighbourhood of the point and forward the response across the 7 layer network. In average, our segmentation achieved an accuracy of 92.68 percent on the testing set from Drive database.

我们已经开发并训练了一个卷积神经网络来自动同时分割视盘，中央凹和血管。在进行分割之前，将眼底图像归一化以强化背景照明和对比度的一致性。对于眼底图像中的每个有效点，我们的算法从点附近提取三个输入通道，并通过七层网络转发响应。平均而言，我们的分割在Drive数据库的测试集中达到了92.68％的准确率。
