##### Abstract
Classification of social media posts in emergency response is an important practical problem: accurate classification can help automate processing of such messages and help other responders and the public react to emergencies in a timely fashion. This research focused on classifying Facebook messages of US police departments. Randomly selected 5,000 messages were used to train classifiers that distinguished between four categories of messages: emergency preparedness, response and recovery, as well as general engagement messages. Features were represented with bag-of-words and word2vec, and models were constructed using support vector machines (SVMs) and convolutional (CNNs) and recurrent neural networks (RNNs). The best performing classifier was an RNN with a custom-trained word2vec model to represent features, which achieved the F1 measure of 0.839.

社交媒体帖子在应急响应中的分类是一个重要的实际问题：准确分类可以帮助自动处理这些消息，帮助其他响应者和公众及时应对突发事件。这项研究集中在对美国警察部门的脸书信息进行分类。随机选择5,000条消息用于训练分类器，区分四类消息：应急准备，响应和恢复，以及一般参与消息。特征用词袋和word2vec来表示，并且使用支持向量机（SVM）和卷积（CNN）和递归神经网络（RNN）来构建模型。表现最好的分类器是一个带有定制训练的word2vec模型的RNN，用于表示特征，实现了0.839的F1测量。
