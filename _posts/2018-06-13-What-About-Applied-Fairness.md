##### Abstract
Machine learning practitioners are often ambivalent about the ethical aspects of their products. We believe anything that gets us from that current state to one in which our systems are achieving some degree of fairness is an improvement that should be welcomed. This is true even when that progress does not get us 100% of the way to the goal of "complete" fairness or perfectly align with our personal belief on which measure of fairness is used. Some measure of fairness being built would still put us in a better position than the status quo. Impediments to getting fairness and ethical concerns applied in real applications, whether they are abstruse philosophical debates or technical overhead such as the introduction of ever more hyper-parameters, should be avoided. In this paper we further elaborate on our argument for this viewpoint and its importance.

##### Abstract (translated by Google)
机器学习从业者往往对其产品的道德方面颇为矛盾。我们相信任何能够让我们从目前的状态到我们的系统达到一定程度的公平的状态是一种应该受到欢迎的改进。即使这种进展不能使我们达到“完全”公平目标的百分之百，或者完全符合我们个人对使用公平标准的信念，也是如此。正在建立的某种公平标准仍然会使我们处于比现状更好的状态。应该避免在实际应用中使用公平性和道德问题的障碍，无论它们是深奥的哲学辩论还是技术开销，例如引入越来越多的超参数。在本文中，我们进一步阐述了我们对这个观点及其重要性的论证。
