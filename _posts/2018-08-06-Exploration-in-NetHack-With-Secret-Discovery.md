##### Abstract
Roguelike games generally feature exploration problems as a critical, yet often repetitive element of gameplay. Automated approaches, however, face challenges in terms of optimality, as well as due to incomplete information, such as from the presence of secret doors. This paper presents an algorithmic approach to exploration of roguelike dungeon environments. Our design aims to minimize exploration time, balancing coverage and discovery of secret areas with resource cost. Our algorithm is based on the concept of occupancy maps popular in robotics, adapted to encourage efficient discovery of secret access points. Through extensive experimentation on NetHack maps we show that this technique is significantly more efficient than simpler greedy approaches and an existing automated player. We further investigate optimized parameterization for the algorithm through a comprehensive data analysis. These results point towards better automation for players as well as heuristics applicable to fully automated gameplay.

Roguelike游戏通常将探索问题作为游戏玩法的关键但通常重复的元素。然而，自动化方法在最优性方面以及由于不完整信息（例如来自秘密门的存在）而面临挑战。本文介绍了一种探索roguelike地牢环境的算法方法。我们的设计旨在最大限度地缩短勘探时间，平衡覆盖范围并发现秘密区域和资源成本。我们的算法基于机器人中流行的占用地图的概念，适用于鼓励有效发现秘密接入点。通过对NetHack地图的大量实验，我们发现这种技术比简单的贪婪方法和现有的自动播放器更有效。我们通过全面的数据分析进一步研究算法的优化参数化。这些结果表明了更好的玩家自动化以及适用于全自动游戏的启发式方法。
