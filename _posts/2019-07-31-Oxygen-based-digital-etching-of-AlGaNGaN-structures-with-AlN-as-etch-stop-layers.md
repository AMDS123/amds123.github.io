##### Abstract
O2-plamsa-based digital etching of Al0.25Ga0.75N with a 0.8 nm AlN spacer on GaN was investigated. At 40 W RF bias power and 40 sccm oxygen flow, the etch depth of Al0.25Ga0.75N was 5.7 nm per cycle. The 0.8 nm AlN spacer layer acted as an etch-stop layer in 3 cycles. The surface roughness improved to 0.33 nm after 7 digital etch cycles. Compared to the dry etch only approach, this technique causes less damages. It was shown to be effective in precisely controlling the AlGaN etch depth required for recessed-AlGaN HEMTs.
