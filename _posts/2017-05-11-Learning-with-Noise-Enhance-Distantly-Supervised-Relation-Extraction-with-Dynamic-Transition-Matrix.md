##### Abstract
Distant supervision significantly reduces human efforts in building training data for many classification tasks. While promising, this technique often introduces noise to the generated training data, which can severely affect the model performance. In this paper, we take a deep look at the application of distant supervision in relation extraction. We show that the dynamic transition matrix can effectively characterize the noise in the training data built by distant supervision. The transition matrix can be effectively trained using a novel curriculum learning based method without any direct supervision about the noise. We thoroughly evaluate our approach under a wide range of extraction scenarios. Experimental results show that our approach consistently improves the extraction results and outperforms the state-of-the-art in various evaluation scenarios.

远程监督显着减少了人力建设许多分类任务的训练数据的努力。虽然有前途，但这种技术往往会将噪声引入生成的训练数据，这会严重影响模型性能。本文深入探讨了远程监督在关系提取中的应用。我们发现，动态转移矩阵可以有效地表征远程监督建立的训练数据中的噪声。转换矩阵可以使用一种新颖的基于课程学习的方法进行有效的训练，而不需要对噪声进行直接监督我们在广泛的提取场景下彻底评估我们的方法。实验结果表明，我们的方法不断提高提取结果，并在各种评估情况下胜过最先进的技术。
