##### Abstract
We propose a new method to evaluate GANs, namely EvalGAN. EvalGAN relies on a test set to directly measure the reconstruction quality in the original sample space (no auxiliary networks are necessary), and it also computes the (log)likelihood for the reconstructed samples in the test set. Further, EvalGAN is agnostic to the GAN algorithm and the dataset. We decided to test it on three state-of-the-art GANs over the well-known CIFAR-10 and CelebA datasets.
