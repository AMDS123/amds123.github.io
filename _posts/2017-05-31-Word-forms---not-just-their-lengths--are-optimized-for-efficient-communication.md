##### Abstract
The inverse relationship between the length of a word and the frequency of its use, first identified by G.K. Zipf in 1935, is a classic empirical law that holds across a wide range of human languages. We demonstrate that length is one aspect of a much more general property of words: how distinctive they are with respect to other words in a language. Distinctiveness plays a critical role in recognizing words in fluent speech, in that it reflects the strength of potential competitors when selecting the best candidate for an ambiguous signal. Phonological information content, a measure of a word's string probability under a statistical model of a language's sound or character sequences, concisely captures distinctiveness. Examining large-scale corpora from 13 languages, we find that distinctiveness significantly outperforms word length as a predictor of frequency. This finding provides evidence that listeners' processing constraints shape fine-grained aspects of word forms across languages.

词的长度与其使用频率之间的反比关系，首先由G.K. 1935年的齐普夫（Zipf），是一门经典的经验法则，涵盖了广泛的人类语言。我们证明这个长度是一个更为普遍的词语的一个方面：它们在语言中与其他词语有多独特。独特性在流利的语言中识别单词中起着至关重要的作用，因为它反映了在为歧义信号选择最佳候选者时潜在竞争者的实力。语音信息内容是一种语言声音或字符序列的统计模型下字串概率的量度，简明扼要地体现了独特性。从13种语言中检查大规模语料库，我们发现独特性显着优于词长度作为频率的预测。这一发现提供了证据表明听众的处理约束形成跨语言的单词形式的细粒度方面。
