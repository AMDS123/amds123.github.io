##### Abstract
In this survey paper, we review recent uses of convolution neural networks (CNNs) to solve inverse problems in imaging. It has recently become feasible to train deep CNNs on large databases of images, and they have shown outstanding performance on object classification and segmentation tasks. Motivated by these successes, researchers have begun to apply CNNs to the resolution of inverse problems such as denoising, deconvolution, super-resolution, and medical image reconstruction, and they have started to report improvements over state-of-the-art methods, including sparsity-based techniques such as compressed sensing. Here, we review the recent experimental work in these areas, with a focus on the critical design decisions: Where does the training data come from? What is the architecture of the CNN? and How is the learning problem formulated and solved? We also bring together a few key theoretical papers that offer perspective on why CNNs are appropriate for inverse problems and point to some next steps in the field.

在这篇调查报告中，我们回顾了卷积神经网络（CNNs）的最近用途来解决成像中的逆问题。最近在大型图像数据库上训练深度CNN成为可行，在对象分类和分割任务方面表现出色。受到这些成功的启发，研究人员已经开始将CNN应用于解决反向问题，如去噪，解卷积，超分辨率和医学图像重建，并开始报告改进方法，包括最先进的方法，包括基于稀疏的技术，如压缩感知。在这里，我们回顾一下最近在这些领域的实验工作，重点关注关键的设计决策：培训数据来自哪里？什么是CNN的架构？学习问题是如何制定和解决的？我们还汇集了一些关键的理论文件，提供有关CNN为什么适用于逆向问题的观点，并指出该领域的下一步工作。
