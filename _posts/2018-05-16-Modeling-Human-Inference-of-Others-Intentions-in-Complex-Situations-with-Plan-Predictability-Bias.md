##### Abstract
A recent approach based on Bayesian inverse planning for the "theory of mind" has shown good performance in modeling human cognition. However, perfect inverse planning differs from human cognition during one kind of complex tasks due to human bounded rationality. One example is an environment in which there are many available plans for achieving a specific goal. We propose a "plan predictability oriented model" as a model of inferring other peoples' goals in complex environments. This model adds the bias that people prefer predictable plans. This bias is calculated with simple plan prediction. We tested this model with a behavioral experiment in which humans observed the partial path of goal-directed actions. Our model had a higher correlation with human inference. We also confirmed the robustness of our model with complex tasks and determined that it can be improved by taking account of individual differences in "bounded rationality".

最近一种基于贝叶斯逆向规划的“心理理论”方法在模拟人类认知方面表现出良好的表现。然而，由于人类有限的理性，完美的逆向规划在一类复杂任务中不同于人类的认知。其中一个例子就是有许多可实现特定目标的计划。我们提出一个“面向计划可预测性的模型”，作为在复杂环境中推断他人目标的模型。这种模式增加了人们偏好可预测计划的偏见。这种偏差是用简单的计划预测来计算的。我们用一个行为实验来测试这个模型，在这个实验中人类观察了目标导向行为的部分路径。我们的模型与人类推论有更高的相关性。我们还证实了我们的模型具有复杂任务的鲁棒性，并确定可以通过考虑“有限理性”中的个体差异来改进它。
