##### Abstract
In this paper, we present a HAnd Mesh Recovery (HAMR) framework to tackle the problem of reconstructing the full 3D mesh of a human hand from a single RGB image. In contrast to existing research on 2D or 3D hand pose estimation from RGB or/and depth image data, HAMR can provide a more expressive and useful mesh representation for monocular hand image understanding. In particular, the mesh representation is achieved by parameterizing a generic 3D hand model with shape and relative 3D joint angles. By utilizing this mesh representation, we can easily compute the 3D joint locations via linear interpolations between the vertexes of the mesh, while obtain the 2D joint locations with a projection of the 3D joints.
