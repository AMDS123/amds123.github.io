##### Abstract
Studies of online social influence have demonstrated that friends have important effects on many types of behavior in a wide variety of settings. However, we know much less about how influence works among relative strangers in digital public squares, despite important conversations happening in such spaces. We present the results of a study on large public Facebook pages where we randomly used two different methods--most recent and social feedback--to order comments on posts. We find that the social feedback condition results in higher quality viewed comments and response comments. After measuring the average quality of comments written by users before the study, we find that social feedback has a positive effect on response quality for both low and high quality commenters. We draw on a theoretical framework of social norms to explain this empirical result. In order to examine the influence mechanism further, we measure the similarity between comments viewed and written during the study, finding that similarity increases for the highest quality contributors under the social feedback condition. This suggests that, in addition to norms, some individuals may respond with increased relevance to high-quality comments.

在线社交影响力的研究表明，朋友在各种场合中对许多类型的行为都有重要的影响。然而，尽管在这样的空间里发生了重要的对话，但是我们对于数字公共广场上相对陌生人的影响力如何，却知之甚少。我们在大型公共Facebook页面上展示一项研究的结果，我们随机使用两种不同的方法 - 最近的和社会反馈 - 对帖子发表评论。我们发现，社会反馈条件导致更高质量的观看评论和回应评论。在测量了用户在研究之前所写评论的平均质量之后，我们发现社交反馈对于低质量评论者的反应质量具有积极影响。我们借鉴社会规范的理论框架来解释这一实证结果。为了进一步检验影响机制，我们测量研究期间观察和评论的评论之间的相似性，发现在社会反馈条件下，最高质量贡献者的相似性增加。这表明，除了规范之外，一些个人可能会对高质量的评论产生更大的影响。
