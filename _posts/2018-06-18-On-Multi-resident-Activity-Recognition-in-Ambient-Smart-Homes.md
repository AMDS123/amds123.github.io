##### Abstract
Increasing attention to the research on activity monitoring in smart homes has motivated the employment of ambient intelligence to reduce the deployment cost and solve the privacy issue. Several approaches have been proposed for multi-resident activity recognition, however, there still lacks a comprehensive benchmark for future research and practical selection of models. In this paper we study different methods for multi-resident activity recognition and evaluate them on same sets of data. The experimental results show that recurrent neural network with gated recurrent units is better than other models and also considerably efficient, and that using combined activities as single labels is more effective than represent them as separate labels.

人们越来越重视智能家居活动监测研究，这激发了环境智能的应用，以降低部署成本并解决隐私问题。已经提出了几种方法用于多居民活动识别，然而，对于未来的研究和实际选择模型还缺乏全面的基准。在本文中，我们研究了多住户活动识别的不同方法，并对同一组数据进行评估。实验结果表明，具有门控循环单位的递归神经网络比其他模型更好，并且也相当有效，并且将组合活动作为单个标签比将它们表示为单独标签更有效。
