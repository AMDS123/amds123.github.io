##### Abstract
Despite the remarkable successes of generative adversarial networks (GANs) in many applications, theoretical understandings of their performance is still limited. In this paper, we present a simple shallow GAN model fed by high-dimensional input data. The dynamics of the training process of the proposed model can be exactly analyzed in the high-dimensional limit. In particular, by using the tool of scaling limits of stochastic processes, we show that the macroscopic quantities measuring the quality of the training process converge to a deterministic process that is characterized as the unique solution of a finite-dimensional ordinary differential equation (ODE). The proposed model is simple, but its training process already exhibits several different phases that can mimic the behaviors of more realistic GAN models used in practice. Specifically, depending on the choice of the learning rates, the training process can reach either a successful, a failed, or an oscillating phase. By studying the steady-state solutions of the limiting ODEs, we obtain a phase diagram that precisely characterizes the conditions under which each phase takes place. Although this work focuses on a simple GAN model, the analysis methods developed here might prove useful in the theoretical understanding of other variants of GANs with more advanced training algorithms.

尽管在许多应用中生成对抗网络（GAN）取得了显着的成功，但对其性能的理论认识仍然有限。在本文中，我们提出了一个由高维输入数据提供的简单浅GAN模型。所提出的模型的训练过程的动态可以在高维极限中被准确地分析。特别是，通过使用随机过程的标度极限工具，我们证明了测量训练过程质量的宏观量收敛于一个确定性过程，该过程的特点是有限维常微分方程（ODE）的唯一解， 。所提出的模型很简单，但其训练过程已经展示了几个不同的阶段，可以模拟实际中使用的更真实的GAN模型的行为。具体而言，根据学习率的选择，培训过程可以达到成功，失败或振荡阶段。通过研究极限常微分方程的稳态解，我们获得了一个相图，它精确表征了每个阶段发生的条件。虽然这项工作专注于一个简单的GAN模型，但是这里开发的分析方法可能对使用更先进的训练算法的其他GAN变体的理论认识有用。
