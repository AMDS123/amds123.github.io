##### Abstract
Visual recognition research often assumes a sufficient resolution of the region of interest (ROI). That is usually violated in practice, inspiring us to explore the Very Low Resolution Recognition (VLRR) problem. Typically, the ROI in a VLRR problem can be smaller than $16 \times 16$ pixels, and is challenging to be recognized even by human experts. We attempt to solve the VLRR problem using deep learning methods. Taking advantage of techniques primarily in super resolution, domain adaptation and robust regression, we formulate a dedicated deep learning method and demonstrate how these techniques are incorporated step by step. Any extra complexity, when introduced, is fully justified by both analysis and simulation results. The resulting \textit{Robust Partially Coupled Networks} achieves feature enhancement and recognition simultaneously. It allows for both the flexibility to combat the LR-HR domain mismatch, and the robustness to outliers. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed models is evaluated on three different VLRR tasks, including face identification, digit recognition and font recognition, all of which obtain very impressive performances.

视觉识别研究通常假定感兴趣区域（ROI）的充分分辨率。这在实践中通常是违反的，激励我们探索极低分辨率识别（VLRR）问题。通常情况下，VLRR问题的投资回报率可能小于16×16×像素，即使是由专家也难以确认。我们尝试使用深度学习方法来解决VLRR问题。我们利用超分辨率技术，领域适应技术和强大回归技术，制定了专门的深度学习方法，并展示了这些技术如何逐步融入其中。在引入时，任何额外的复杂性都可以通过分析和模拟结果来充分证明。最终的\ textit {Robust Partially Coupled Networks}同时实现了特征增强和识别。它可以兼顾抗LR-HR域失配的灵活性和对异常值的鲁棒性。最后，对三种不同的VLRR任务（包括人脸识别，数字识别和字体识别）评估所提出的模型的有效性，所有这些都取得了令人印象深刻的表现。
