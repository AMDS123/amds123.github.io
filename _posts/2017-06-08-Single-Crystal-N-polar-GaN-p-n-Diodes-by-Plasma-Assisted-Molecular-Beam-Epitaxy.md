##### Abstract
N-polar GaN p-n diodes are realized on single-crystal N-polar GaN bulk wafers by plasma-assisted molecular beam epitaxy growth. The current-voltage characteristics show high-quality rectification and electroluminescence characteristics with a high on/off current ratio and interband photon emission. The measured electroluminescence spectrum is dominated by strong near-band edge emission, while deep level luminescence is greatly suppressed. A very low dislocation density leads to a high reverse breakdown electric field. The low leakage current N-polar diodes open up several potential applications in polarization-engineered photonic and electronic devices.
