##### Abstract
Reconstructing 3D object models is playing an important role in many applications in the field of computer vision. Instead of employing a collection of cameras and/or sensors as in many studies, this paper proposes a simple way to build a cheaper system for 3D reconstruction using only one depth camera and 2 or more mirrors. Each mirror is equivalently considered as a depth camera at another viewpoint. Since all scene data are provided by only one depth sensor, our approach can be applied to moving objects and does not require any synchronization protocol as with a set of cameras. Some experiments were performed on easy-to-evaluate objects to confirm the reconstruction accuracy of our proposed system.
