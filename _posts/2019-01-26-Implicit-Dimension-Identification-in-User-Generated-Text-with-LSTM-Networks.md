##### Abstract
In the process of online storytelling, individual users create and consume highly diverse content that contains a great deal of implicit beliefs and not plainly expressed narrative. It is hard to manually detect these implicit beliefs, intentions and moral foundations of the writers. We study and investigate two different tasks, each of which reflect the difficulty of detecting an implicit user's knowledge, intent or belief that may be based on writer's moral foundation: 1) political perspective detection in news articles 2) identification of informational vs. conversational questions in community question answering (CQA) archives and. In both tasks we first describe new interesting annotated datasets and make the datasets publicly available. Second, we compare various classification algorithms, and show the differences in their performance on both tasks. Third, in political perspective detection task we utilize a narrative representation language of local press to identify perspective differences between presumably neutral American and British press.
