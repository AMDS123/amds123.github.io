##### Abstract
Being inspired by child's learning experience - taught first and followed by observation and questioning, we investigate a critically supervised learning methodology for object detection in this work. Specifically, we propose a taught-observe-ask (TOA) method that consists of several novel components such as negative object proposal, critical example mining, and machine-guided question-answer (QA) labeling. To consider labeling time and performance jointly, new evaluation methods are developed to compare the performance of the TOA method, with the fully and weakly supervised learning methods. Extensive experiments are conducted on the PASCAL VOC and the Caltech benchmark datasets. The TOA method provides significantly improved performance of weakly supervision yet demands only about 3-6% of labeling time of full supervision. The effectiveness of each novel component is also analyzed.

受到孩子学习经验的启发 - 首先被教导，然后被观察和质疑，我们调查了一个批判性监督的学习方法，用于物体检测。具体而言，我们提出了一个包含负面对象建议，关键示例挖掘和机器引导问答（QA）标签等几个新颖组件的教学观察问题（TOA）方法。为了考虑对时间和性能进行联合标注，我们开发了新的评估方法来比较TOA方法的性能和完全和弱监督的学习方法。在PASCAL VOC和Caltech基准数据集上进行了大量的实验。 TOA方法显着改善了监督力度不够的表现，但只需要全面监督的标记时间的3-6％。还分析了每个新颖组件的有效性。
