##### Abstract
In this paper, we present a novel method for analysis and segmentation of laminar structure of the cortex based on tissue characteristics whose change across the gray matter facilitates distinction between cortical layers. We develop and analyze features of individual neurons to investigate changes in architectonic differentiation and present a novel high-performance, automated tree-ensemble method trained on data manually labeled by three human investigators. From the location and basic measures of neurons, more complex features are developed and used in machine learning models for automatic segmentation of cortical layers. Tree ensembles are used on data manually labeled by three human experts. The most accurate classification results were obtained by training three models separately and creating another ensemble by combining probability outputs for final neuron layer classification. Measurement of importances of developed neuron features on both global model level and individual prediction level are obtained.
