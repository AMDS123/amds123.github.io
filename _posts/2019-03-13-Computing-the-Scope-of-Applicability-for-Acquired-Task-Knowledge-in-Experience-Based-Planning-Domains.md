##### Abstract
Experience-based planning domains have been proposed to improve problem solving by learning from experience. They rely on acquiring and using task knowledge, i.e., activity schemata, for generating solutions to problem instances in a class of tasks. Using Three-Valued Logic Analysis (TVLA), we extend previous work to generate a set of conditions that determine the scope of applicability of an activity schema. The inferred scope is a bounded representation of a set of problems of potentially unbounded size, in the form of a 3-valued logical structure, which is used to automatically find an applicable activity schema for solving task problems. We validate this work in two classical planning domains.
