##### Abstract
The last several years have seen significant progress in using depth cameras for tracking articulated objects such as human bodies, hands, and robotic manipulators. Most approaches focus on tracking skeletal parameters of a fixed shape model, which makes them insufficient for applications that require accurate estimates of deformable object surfaces. To overcome this limitation, we present a 3D model-based tracking system for articulated deformable objects. Our system is able to track human body pose and high resolution surface contours in real time using a commodity depth sensor and GPU hardware. We implement this as a joint optimization over a skeleton to account for changes in pose, and over the vertices of a high resolution mesh to track the subject's shape. Through experimental results we show that we are able to capture dynamic sub-centimeter surface detail such as folds and wrinkles in clothing. We also show that this shape estimation aids kinematic pose estimation by providing a more accurate target to match against the point cloud. The end result is highly accurate spatiotemporal and semantic information which is well suited for physical human robot interaction as well as virtual and augmented reality systems.

过去几年，在使用深度相机跟踪人体，手和机器人操纵器等铰接物体方面取得了重大进展。大多数方法专注于追踪固定形状模型的骨架参数，这使得它们不足以用于需要对可变形物体表面进行精确估计的应用。为了克服这个限制，我们提出了一个三维模型为基础的跟踪系统的关节变形的对象。我们的系统能够使用商品深度传感器和GPU硬件实时跟踪人体姿态和高分辨率表面轮廓。我们将这个作为一个骨架上的联合优化来实现，以说明姿态的变化以及高分辨率网格的顶点以跟踪主体的形状。通过实验结果，我们显示，我们能够捕捉动态亚厘米的表面细节，如褶皱和衣服上的皱纹。我们还表明，这种形状估计通过提供更准确的目标来匹配点云来辅助运动姿态估计。最终结果是非常准确的时空和语义信息，非常适合物理人机器人交互以及虚拟和增强现实系统。
