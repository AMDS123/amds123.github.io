##### Abstract
In this paper we present a new camera calibration method aimed at finding a straight-line locus, in a special colour feature space, that is traversed by daylights and as well also approximately followed by specular points. The aim of the calibration is to enable recovering the colour of the illuminant in a scene, using the calibrated camera. First we prove theoretically that any candidate specular points, for an image that is generated by a specific camera and taken under a daylight, must lie on a straight line in log-chromaticity space, for a chromaticity that is generated using a geometric-mean denominator. Use is made of the assumptions that daylight illuminants can be approximated using Planckians and that camera sensors are narrowband or can be made so by spectral sharpening. Then we show how a particular camera can be calibrated so as to discover this locus. As applications we use this curve for illuminant detection, and also for re-lighting of images to show they would appear under lighting having a different colour temperature.

在本文中，我们提出了一种新的摄像机标定方法，旨在找到一个直线轨迹，在一个特定的颜色特征空间，是通过日光，以及也大致后面镜面点。校准的目的是使用校准的摄​​像机来恢复场景中光源的颜色。首先我们从理论上证明，对于由特定摄像机生成并在日光下拍摄的图像，任何候选镜面反射点必须位于对数色度空间中的一条直线上，对于使用几何平均分母生成的色度。使用的假设是日光光源可以用普朗克近似，相机传感器是窄带的，或者可以通过光谱锐化来制作。然后我们展示一个特定的摄像机如何被校准以发现这个轨迹。作为应用，我们使用这条曲线进行光源检测，也可以对图像进行重新照明，以显示它们将出现在具有不同色温的照明下。
