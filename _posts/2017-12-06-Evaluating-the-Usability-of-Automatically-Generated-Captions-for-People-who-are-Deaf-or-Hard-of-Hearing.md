##### Abstract
The accuracy of Automated Speech Recognition (ASR) technology has improved, but it is still imperfect in many settings. Researchers who evaluate ASR performance often focus on improving the Word Error Rate (WER) metric, but WER has been found to have little correlation with human-subject performance on many applications. We propose a new captioning-focused evaluation metric that better predicts the impact of ASR recognition errors on the usability of automatically generated captions for people who are Deaf or Hard of Hearing (DHH). Through a user study with 30 DHH users, we compared our new metric with the traditional WER metric on a caption usability evaluation task. In a side-by-side comparison of pairs of ASR text output (with identical WER), the texts preferred by our new metric were preferred by DHH participants. Further, our metric had significantly higher correlation with DHH participants' subjective scores on the usability of a caption, as compared to the correlation between WER metric and participant subjective scores. This new metric could be used to select ASR systems for captioning applications, and it may be a better metric for ASR researchers to consider when optimizing ASR systems.

自动语音识别（ASR）技术的准确性有所提高，但在许多环境中仍然不完善。对ASR性能进行评估的研究人员往往将注意力集中在改善Word错误率（WER）指标上，但是在许多应用中发现WER与人类学科的表现关系不大。我们提出了一种新的以字幕为重点的评估指标，可以更好地预测ASR识别错误对聋人或听力障碍者（DHH）自动生成字幕的可用性的影响。通过30名DHH用户的用户研究，我们将新的度量标准与传统的WER度量标准进行了比较。在对ASR文本输出（具有相同的WER）进行并排比较时，DHH参与者偏好我们的新度量的文本。此外，与WER指标和参与者主观评分之间的相关性相比，我们的指标与DHH参与者对标题可用性的主观评分具有显着较高的相关性。这个新的度量标准可以用于选择字幕应用的ASR系统，对于ASR研究人员来说，优化ASR系统可能是一个更好的衡量标准。
