##### Abstract
The accuracy of Automated Speech Recognition (ASR) technology has improved, but it is still imperfect in many settings. Researchers who evaluate ASR performance often focus on improving the Word Error Rate (WER) metric, but WER has been found to have little correlation with human-subject performance on many applications. We propose a new captioning-focused evaluation metric that better predicts the impact of ASR recognition errors on the usability of automatically generated captions for people who are Deaf or Hard of Hearing (DHH). Through a user study with 30 DHH users, we compared our new metric with the traditional WER metric on a caption usability evaluation task. In a side-by-side comparison of pairs of ASR text output (with identical WER), the texts preferred by our new metric were preferred by DHH participants. Further, our metric had significantly higher correlation with DHH participants' subjective scores on the usability of a caption, as compared to the correlation between WER metric and participant subjective scores. This new metric could be used to select ASR systems for captioning applications, and it may be a better metric for ASR researchers to consider when optimizing ASR systems.

自动语音识别（ASR）技术的准确性有所提高，但在许多情况下仍然不完善。评估ASR性能的研究人员通常关注于提高字错误率（WER）度量标准，但已发现WER与许多应用程序中的人体对象性能几乎没有关联。我们提出了一种新的以字幕为中心的评估指标，可以更好地预测ASR识别错误对聋人或听力障碍人士（DHH）自动生成字幕的可用性的影响。通过对30位DHH用户的用户研究，我们将新指标与标题可用性评估任务的传统WER指标进行了比较。在ASR文本输出对（具有相同的WER）的并排比较中，DHH参与者首选我们新指标所偏爱的文本。此外，与WER度量与参与者主观得分之间的相关性相比，我们的度量与DHH参与者对字幕可用性的主观评分具有显着更高的相关性。这个新指标可用于为字幕应用选择ASR系统，对于ASR研究人员在优化ASR系统时要考虑的因素，这可能是一个更好的指标。
