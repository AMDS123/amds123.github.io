##### Abstract
In this paper, we propose a novel deep neural network model that reconstructs a high dynamic range (HDR) image from a single low dynamic range (LDR) image. The proposed model is based on a convolutional neural network composed of dilated convolutional layers, and infers LDR images with various exposures and illumination from a single LDR image of the same scene. Then, the final HDR image can be formed by merging these inference results. It is relatively easy for the proposed method to find the mapping between the LDR and an HDR with a different bit depth because of the chaining structure inferring the relationship between the LDR images with brighter (or darker) exposures from a given LDR image. The method not only extends the range, but also has the advantage of restoring the light information of the actual physical world. For the HDR images obtained by the proposed method, the HDR-VDP2 Q score, which is the most popular evaluation metric for HDR images, was 56.36 for a display with a 1920$\times$1200 resolution, which is an improvement of 6 compared with the scores of conventional algorithms. In addition, when comparing the peak signal-to-noise ratio values for tone mapped HDR images generated by the proposed and conventional algorithms, the average value obtained by the proposed algorithm is 30.86 dB, which is 10 dB higher than those obtained by the conventional algorithms.

在本文中，我们提出了一种新的深度神经网络模型，从单个低动态范围（LDR）图像重建高动态范围（HDR）图像。所提出的模型是基于由膨胀的卷积层组成的卷积神经网络，并且从相同场景的单个LDR图像推断具有各种曝光和照明的LDR图像。然后，通过合并这些推断结果可以形成最终的HDR图像。由于链接结构推断LDR图像与来自给定LDR图像的较亮（或较暗）曝光之间的关系，所提出的方法相对容易地找到具有不同位深度的LDR与HDR之间的映射。该方法不仅扩大了范围，而且还具有恢复实际物理世界的光信息的优点。对于通过所提出的方法获得的HDR图像，作为HDR图像最流行的评估指标的HDR-VDP2Q得分为56.36，其分辨率为1920×1200，这相比于传统算法的分数。另外，在比较由所提出的算法和传统算法生成的色调映射HDR图像的峰值信噪比值时，通过所提出的算法获得的平均值是30.86dB，比传统算法所获得的平均值高10dB算法。
