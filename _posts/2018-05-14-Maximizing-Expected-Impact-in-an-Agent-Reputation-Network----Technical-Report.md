##### Abstract
Many multi-agent systems (MASs) are situated in stochastic environments. Some such systems that are based on the partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP) do not take the benevolence of other agents for granted. We propose a new POMDP-based framework which is general enough for the specification of a variety of stochastic MAS domains involving the impact of agents on each other's reputations. A unique feature of this framework is that actions are specified as either undirected (regular) or directed (towards a particular agent), and a new directed transition function is provided for modeling the effects of reputation in interactions. Assuming that an agent must maintain a good enough reputation to survive in the network, a planning algorithm is developed for an agent to select optimal actions in stochastic MASs. Preliminary evaluation is provided via an example specification and by determining the algorithm's complexity.

许多多代理系统（MAS）位于随机环境中。一些基于部分可观察的马尔可夫决策过程（POMDP）的这样的系统并不认为其他代理人的善意是理所当然的。我们提出了一种新的基于POMDP的框架，该框架足以描述各种随机MAS域，涉及代理对彼此声誉的影响。该框架的一个独特之处在于，动作被指定为无向（定向）或定向（指向特定的代理），并且提供了一个新的定向转换函数来模拟交互中信誉的影响。假设代理必须保持足够好的声誉才能在网络中生存下来，为代理人开发一个规划算法来选择随机MAS中的最优行动。通过一个示例规范并通过确定算法的复杂性来提供初步评估。
