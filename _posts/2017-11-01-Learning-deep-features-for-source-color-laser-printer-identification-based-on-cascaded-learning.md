##### Abstract
Color laser printers have fast printing speed and high resolution, and forgeries using color laser printers can cause significant harm to society. A source printer identification technique can be employed as a countermeasure to those forgeries. This paper presents a color laser printer identification method based on cascaded learning of deep neural networks. The refiner network is trained by adversarial training to refine the synthetic dataset for halftone color decomposition. The halftone color decomposing ConvNet is trained with the refined dataset, and the trained knowledge is transferred to the printer identifying ConvNet to enhance the accuracy. The robustness about rotation and scaling is considered in training process, which is not considered in existing methods. Experiments are performed on eight color laser printers, and the performance is compared with several existing methods. The experimental results clearly show that the proposed method outperforms existing source color laser printer identification methods.

彩色激光打印机打印速度快，分辨率高，使用彩色激光打印机进行伪造会对社会造成重大的危害。可以使用源打印机识别技术作为对付这些伪造的对策。本文提出了一种基于深度神经网络级联学习的彩色激光打印机识别方法。细化剂网络通过对抗训练来训练以改进用于半色调分解的合成数据集。用精化数据集训练半色调分解ConvNet，并将训练好的知识转移到识别ConvNet的打印机上以提高准确性。在训练过程中考虑了旋转和缩放的鲁棒性，这在现有方法中没有考虑。在八台彩色激光打印机上进行实验，并将性能与现有的几种方法进行比较。实验结果清楚地表明，所提出的方法胜过现有的彩色激光打印机识别方法。
