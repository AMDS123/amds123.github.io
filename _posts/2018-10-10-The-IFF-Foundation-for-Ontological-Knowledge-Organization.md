##### Abstract
This paper discusses an axiomatic approach for the integration of ontologies, an approach that extends to first order logic a previous approach (Kent 2000) based on information flow. This axiomatic approach is represented in the Information Flow Framework (IFF), a metalevel framework for organizing the information that appears in digital libraries, distributed databases and ontologies (Kent 2001). The paper argues that the integration of ontologies is the two-step process of alignment and unification. Ontological alignment consists of the sharing of common terminology and semantics through a mediating ontology. Ontological unification, concentrated in a virtual ontology of community connections, is fusion of the alignment diagram of participant community ontologies - the quotient of the sum of the participant portals modulo the ontological alignment structure.
