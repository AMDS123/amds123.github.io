##### Abstract
In recent years, probabilistic forecasts techniques were proposed in research as well as in applications to integrate volatile renewable energy resources into the electrical grid. These techniques allow decision makers to take the uncertainty of the prediction into account and, therefore, to devise optimal decisions, e.g., related to costs and risks in the electrical grid. However, it was yet not studied how the input, such as numerical weather predictions, affects the model output of forecasting models in detail. Therefore, we examine the potential influences with techniques from the field of sensitivity analysis on three different black-box models to obtain insights into differences and similarities of these probabilistic models. The analysis shows a considerable number of potential influences in those models depending on, e.g., the predicted probability and the type of model. These effects motivate the need to take various influences into account when models are tested, analyzed, or compared. Nevertheless, results of the sensitivity analysis will allow us to select a model with advantages in the practical application.

近年来，在研究以及将挥发性可再生能源资源整合到电网中的应用中提出了概率预测技术。这些技术允许决策者考虑预测的不确定性，并因此设计最佳决策，例如，与电网中的成本和风险相关。然而，尚未研究输入（如数值天气预测）如何详细影响预测模型的模型输出。因此，我们研究了灵敏度分析技术对三种不同黑盒模型的潜在影响，以深入了解这些概率模型的差异和相似之处。该分析显示了这些模型中的相当多的潜在影响，这取决于例如预测的概率和模型的类型。当模型被测试，分析或比较时，这些效果促使需要考虑各种影响。然而，灵敏度分析的结果将允许我们选择在实际应用中具有优势的模型。
