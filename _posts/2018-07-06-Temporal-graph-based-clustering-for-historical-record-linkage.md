##### Abstract
Research in the social sciences is increasingly based on large and complex data collections, where individual data sets from different domains are linked and integrated to allow advanced analytics. A popular type of data used in such a context are historical censuses, as well as birth, death, and marriage certificates. Individually, such data sets however limit the types of studies that can be conducted. Specifically, it is impossible to track individuals, families, or households over time. Once such data sets are linked and family trees spanning several decades are available it is possible to, for example, investigate how education, health, mobility, employment, and social status influence each other and the lives of people over two or even more generations. A major challenge is however the accurate linkage of historical data sets which is due to data quality and commonly also the lack of ground truth data being available. Unsupervised techniques need to be employed, which can be based on similarity graphs generated by comparing individual records. In this paper we present initial results from clustering birth records from Scotland where we aim to identify all births of the same mother and group siblings into clusters. We extend an existing clustering technique for record linkage by incorporating temporal constraints that must hold between births by the same mother, and propose a novel greedy temporal clustering technique. Experimental results show improvements over non-temporary approaches, however further work is needed to obtain links of high quality.

社会科学研究越来越多地基于大型复杂数据集，其中来自不同领域的各个数据集被链接和集成以允许高级分析。在这种情况下使用的一种流行的数据类型是历史人口普查，以及出生，死亡和结婚证书。但是，这些数据集单独限制了可以进行的研究类型。具体而言，随着时间的推移，无法跟踪个人，家庭或家庭。一旦这些数据集相互关联并且可以获得跨越几十年的家庭树木，就有可能例如调查教育，健康，流动性，就业和社会地位如何相互影响以及两代甚至更多代人的生活。然而，主要的挑战是历史数据集的准确链接，这是由于数据质量和通常还缺乏可用的地面实况数据。需要采用无监督技术，这可以基于通过比较各个记录生成的相似性图。在本文中，我们展示了来自苏格兰的聚类出生记录的初步结果，其中我们的目标是将同一母亲和群体兄弟姐妹的所有分娩识别为群集。我们通过结合同一母亲在出生之间必须保持的时间约束来扩展现有的用于记录连接的聚类技术，并提出一种新颖的贪婪时间聚类技术。实验结果显示了对非临时方法的改进，但是需要进一步的工作来获得高质量的链接。
