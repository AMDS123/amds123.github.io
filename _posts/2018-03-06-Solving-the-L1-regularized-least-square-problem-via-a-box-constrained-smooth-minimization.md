##### Abstract
In this paper, an equivalent smooth minimization for the L1 regularized least square problem is proposed. The proposed problem is a convex box-constrained smooth minimization which allows applying fast optimization methods to find its solution. Further, it is investigated that the property "the dual of dual is primal" holds for the L1 regularized least square problem. A solver for the smooth problem is proposed, and its affinity to the proximal gradient is shown. Finally, the experiments on L1 and total variation regularized problems are performed, and the corresponding results are reported.

本文给出了L1正则化最小二乘问题的等价光滑最小化问题。所提出的问题是凸盒约束平滑最小化，其允许应用快速优化方法来找到其解决方案。进一步研究了L1对正最小二乘问题的“双对偶是原点”性质。提出了光滑问题的求解器，并显示了它对近端梯度的亲和力。最后，对L1和总变差正则化问题进行了实验，并给出了相应的结果。
