##### Abstract
The need of high brightness micro-displays in portable applications dedicated to mixed and/or virtual reality has drawn an important research wave on InGaN/GaN based micro-sized light emitting diodes ({\mu}LEDs). We propose to use a SPICE modelling technique to describe and simulate the electro-optical behavior of the {\mu}LED. A sub-circuit portrayal of the whole device will be used to describe current-voltage behavior and the optical power performance of the device based on the ABC model. We suggest an innovative method to derive instantaneously the carrier concentration from the simulated electrical current in order to determine the {\mu}LED quantum efficiency. In a second step, a statistical approach is also added into the SPICE model in order to apprehend the spread on experimental data. This {\mu}LED SPICE modelling approach is very important to allow the design of robust pixel driving circuits.
