##### Abstract
Every field of research consists of multiple application areas with various techniques routinely used to solve problems in these wide range of application areas. With the exponential growth in research volumes, it has become difficult to keep track of the ever-growing number of application areas as well as the corresponding problem solving techniques. In this paper, we consider the computational linguistics domain and present a novel information extraction system that automatically constructs a pool of all application areas in this domain and appropriately links them with corresponding problem solving techniques. Further, we categorize individual research articles based on their application area and the techniques proposed/used in the article. k-gram based discounting method along with handwritten rules and bootstrapped pattern learning is employed to extract application areas. Subsequently, a language modeling approach is proposed to characterize each article based on its application area. Similarly, regular expressions and high-scoring noun phrases are used for the extraction of the problem solving techniques. We propose a greedy approach to characterize each article based on the techniques. Towards the end, we present a table representing the most frequent techniques adopted for a particular application area. Finally, we propose three use cases presenting an extensive temporal analysis of the usage of techniques and application areas.

每个研究领域都由多个应用领域组成，这些应用领域常用来解决这些广泛的应用领域中的问题。随着研究量的急剧增长，跟踪日益增长的应用领域以及相应的解决问题的技术已变得困难。在本文中，我们考虑计算语言学领域，并提出一个新的信息提取系统，自动构建一个在这个领域的所有应用领域的池，并将其与相应的问题解决技术进行适当的联系。此外，我们根据他们的应用领域和文章中提出/使用的技术对个别研究文章进行分类。基于k-gram的折扣方法和手写规则以及引导模式学习被用来提取应用领域。随后，提出了一种语言建模方法来根据其应用领域来表征每篇文章。类似地，正则表达式和高分名词短语被用于提取问题解决技术。我们提出了一种贪婪的方法来描述基于这些技术的每篇文章。最后，我们提供了一个表格，代表了特定应用领域采用的最常用技术。最后，我们提出了三个用例，对技术和应用领域的使用进行了广泛的时间分析。
