##### Abstract
Recognizing emotion from speech has become one the active research themes in speech processing and in applications based on human-computer interaction. This paper conducts an experimental study on recognizing emotions from human speech. The emotions considered for the experiments include neutral, anger, joy and sadness. The distinuishability of emotional features in speech were studied first followed by emotion classification performed on a custom dataset. The classification was performed for different classifiers. One of the main feature attribute considered in the prepared dataset was the peak-to-peak distance obtained from the graphical representation of the speech signals. After performing the classification tests on a dataset formed from 30 different subjects, it was found that for getting better accuracy, one should consider the data collected from one person rather than considering the data from a group of people.

从语音中识别情感已经成为语音处理和基于人机交互的应用的一个活跃的研究主题。本文进行了从人类语音中识别情绪的实验研究。为实验考虑的情绪包括中立，愤怒，喜悦和悲伤。首先研究语音情感特征的不可分辨性，然后在自定义数据集上进行情感分类。分类是针对不同的分类器进行的。准备数据集中考虑的主要特征属性之一是从语音信号的图形表示中获得的峰间距离。对由30个不同科目构成的数据集进行分类测试后发现，为了获得更好的准确性，应考虑从一个人收集的数据，而不是考虑来自一组人的数据。
