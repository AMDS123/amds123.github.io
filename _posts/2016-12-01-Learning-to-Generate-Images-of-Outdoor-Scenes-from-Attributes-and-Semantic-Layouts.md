##### Abstract
Automatic image synthesis research has been rapidly growing with deep networks getting more and more expressive. In the last couple of years, we have observed images of digits, indoor scenes, birds, chairs, etc. being automatically generated. The expressive power of image generators have also been enhanced by introducing several forms of conditioning variables such as object names, sentences, bounding box and key-point locations. In this work, we propose a novel deep conditional generative adversarial network architecture that takes its strength from the semantic layout and scene attributes integrated as conditioning variables. We show that our architecture is able to generate realistic outdoor scene images under different conditions, e.g. day-night, sunny-foggy, with clear object boundaries.

随着深度网络越来越多，自动图像合成研究得到迅速发展。在过去的几年中，我们观察到了数字，室内场景，鸟，椅子等自动生成的图像。通过引入几种形式的条件变量，如对象名称，句子，边界框和关键点位置，图像生成器的表现力也得到了增强。在这项工作中，我们提出了一个新的深度条件生成对抗网络架构，其强大的语义布局和场景属性集成为条件变量。我们展示了我们的架构能够在不同条件下生成逼真的户外场景图像，例如，日夜，阳光明媚，有清晰的物体界限。
