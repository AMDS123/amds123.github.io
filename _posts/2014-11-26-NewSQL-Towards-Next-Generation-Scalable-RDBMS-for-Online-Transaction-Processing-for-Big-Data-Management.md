##### Abstract
One of the key advances in resolving the big-data problem has been the emergence of an alternative database technology. Today, classic RDBMS are complemented by a rich set of alternative Data Management Systems (DMS) specially designed to handle the volume, variety, velocity and variability ofBig Data collections; these DMS include NoSQL, NewSQL and Search-based systems. NewSQL is a class of modern relational database management systems (RDBMS) that provide the same scalable performance of NoSQL systems for online transaction processing (OLTP) read-write workloads while still maintaining the ACID guarantees of a traditional database system. This paper discusses about NewSQL data management system; and compares with NoSQL and with traditional database system. This paper covers architecture, characteristics, classification of NewSQL databases for online transaction processing (OLTP) for Big data management. It also provides the list ofpopular NoSQL as well as NewSQL databases in separate categorized tables. This paper compares SQL based RDBMS, NoSQL and NewSQL databases with set of metrics; as well as, addressed some research issues ofNoSQL and NewSQL.
