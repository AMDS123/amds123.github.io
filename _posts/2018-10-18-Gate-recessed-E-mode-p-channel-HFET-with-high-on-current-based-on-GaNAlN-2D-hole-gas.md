##### Abstract
High-performance p-channel transistors are crucial to implementing efficient complementary circuits in wide-bandgap electronics, but progress on such devices has lagged far behind their powerful electron-based counterparts due to the inherent challenges of manipulating holes in wide-gap semiconductors. Building on recent advances in materials growth, this work sets simultaneous records in both on-current (10 mA/mm) and on-off modulation (four orders) for the GaN/AlN wide-bandgap p-FET structure. A compact analytical pFET model is derived, and the results are benchmarked against the various alternatives in the literature, clarifying the heterostructure trade-offs to enable integrated wide-bandgap CMOS for next-generation compact high-power devices.
