##### Abstract
Recently, compressed sensing (CS) computed tomography (CT) using sparse projection views has been extensively investigated to reduce the potential risk of radiation to patient. However, due to the insufficient number of projection views, an analytic reconstruction approach results in severe streaking artifacts and CS-based iterative approach is computationally very expensive. To address this issue, here we propose a novel deep residual learning approach for sparse view CT reconstruction. Specifically, based on a novel persistent homology analysis showing that the manifold of streaking artifacts is topologically simpler than original ones, a deep residual learning architecture that estimates the streaking artifacts is developed. Once a streaking artifact image is estimated, an artifact-free image can be obtained by subtracting the streaking artifacts from the input image. Using extensive experiments with real patient data set, we confirm that the proposed residual learning provides significantly better image reconstruction performance with several orders of magnitude faster computational speed.

近来，使用稀疏投影视图的压缩感测（CS）计算机断层摄影（CT）已被广泛研究以减少对患者的辐射潜在风险。然而，由于投影视图的数量不足，分析重建方法导致严重的条纹伪影，并且基于CS的迭代方法在计算上非常昂贵。为了解决这个问题，在这里我们提出了一种新的深度残差学习方法的稀疏视图CT重建。具体而言，基于新颖的持续同源性分析显示，裸奔伪影的流形在拓扑上比原始流形更简单，开发了用于估计裸奔伪影的深度残留学习体系结构。一旦条纹伪影图像被估计，可以通过从输入图像中减去条纹伪影来获得无伪像的图像。通过对真实患者数据集进行广泛的实验，我们确认了所提出的残差学习提供了显着更好的图像重建性能，其计算速度提高了几个数量级。
