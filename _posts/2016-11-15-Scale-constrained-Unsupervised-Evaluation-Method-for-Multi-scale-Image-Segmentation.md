##### Abstract
Unsupervised evaluation of segmentation quality is a crucial step in image segmentation applications. Previous unsupervised evaluation methods usually lacked the adaptability to multi-scale segmentation. A scale-constrained evaluation method that evaluates segmentation quality according to the specified target scale is proposed in this paper. First, regional saliency and merging cost are employed to describe intra-region homogeneity and inter-region heterogeneity, respectively. Subsequently, both of them are standardized into equivalent spectral distances of a predefined region. Finally, by analyzing the relationship between image characteristics and segmentation quality, we establish the evaluation model. Experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms four commonly used unsupervised methods in multi-scale evaluation tasks.

分割质量的无监督评估是图像分割应用中的关键步骤。以前的无监督评价方法通常缺乏对多尺度分割的适应性。提出了一种尺度约束评估方法，该方法根据指定的目标尺度评估分割质量。首先，区域显着性和合并成本分别被用来描述区域内的同质性和区域间的异质性。随后，它们都被标准化为预定义区域的等效光谱距离。最后，通过分析图像特征与分割质量的关系，建立评价模型。实验结果表明，该方法在多尺度评估任务中优于四种常用的无监督方法。
