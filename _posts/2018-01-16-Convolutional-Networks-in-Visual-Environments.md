##### Abstract
The puzzle of computer vision might find new challenging solutions when we realize that most successful methods are working at image level, which is remarkably more difficult than processing directly visual streams. In this paper, we claim that their processing naturally leads to formulate the motion invariance principle, which enables the construction of a new theory of learning with convolutional networks. The theory addresses a number of intriguing questions that arise in natural vision, and offers a well-posed computational scheme for the discovery of convolutional filters over the retina. They are driven by differential equations derived from the principle of least cognitive action. Unlike traditional convolutional networks, which need massive supervision, the proposed theory offers a truly new scenario in which feature learning takes place by unsupervised processing of video signals. It is pointed out that an opportune blurring of the video, along the interleaving of segments of null signal, make it possible to conceive a novel learning mechanism that yields the minimum of the cognitive action. Basically, while the theory enables the implementation of novel computer vision systems, it is also provides an intriguing explanation of the solution that evolution has discovered for humans, where it looks like that the video blurring in newborns and the day-night rhythm seem to emerge in a general computational framework, regardless of biology.

当我们意识到大多数成功的方法在图像层面上工作时，计算机视觉的难题可能会发现新的具有挑战性的解决方案，这比直接处理视觉流要困难得多。在本文中，我们声称它们的处理自然会导致制定运动不变性原理，从而能够用卷积网络构建一个新的学习理论。该理论解决了自然视觉中出现的许多有趣的问题，并为在视网膜上发现卷积滤波器提供了一个适当的计算方案。它们是由最小认知行为原理导出的微分方程驱动的。与传统的需要大规模监督的卷积网络不同，所提出的理论提供了一种真正的新方案，其中通过无监督地处理视频信号来进行特征学习。指出视频的适时模糊沿着零信号片段的交织使得有可能构思一种产生最小认知行为的新颖的学习机制。基本上，虽然这个理论能够实现新颖的计算机视觉系统，但它也为人类发现的解决方案提供了一个有趣的解释，看起来新生儿的视频模糊和昼夜节奏似乎出现了在一般的计算框架中，不管生物学如何。
