##### Abstract
In this paper, we introduce an emotional speech synthesizer based on the recent end-to-end neural model, named Tacotron. Despite its benefits, we found that the original Tacotron suffers from the exposure bias problem and irregularity of the attention alignment. Later, we address the problem by utilization of context vector and residual connection at recurrent neural networks (RNNs). Our experiments showed that the model could successfully train and generate speech for given emotion labels.
