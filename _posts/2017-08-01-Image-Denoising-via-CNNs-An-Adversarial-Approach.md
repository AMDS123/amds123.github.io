##### Abstract
Is it possible to recover an image from its noisy version using convolutional neural networks? This is an interesting problem as convolutional layers are generally used as feature detectors for tasks like classification, segmentation and object detection. We present a new CNN architecture for blind image denoising which synergically combines three architecture components, a multi-scale feature extraction layer which helps in reducing the effect of noise on feature maps, an l_p regularizer which helps in selecting only the appropriate feature maps for the task of reconstruction, and finally a three step training approach which leverages adversarial training to give the final performance boost to the model. The proposed model shows competitive denoising performance when compared to the state-of-the-art approaches.

是否有可能使用卷积神经网络从其噪声版本恢复图像？这是一个有趣的问题，因为卷积层通常用作分类，分割和对象检测等任务的特征检测器。我们提出了一种新的盲图像去噪的CNN体​​系结构，它协同结合了三个体系结构组件，一个多尺度的特征提取层，有助于降低噪声对特征映射的影响，一个l_p规则化器，帮助选择适当的特征映射重建任务，最后采取三步训练方式，利用对抗训练，最终提升模型性能。与最先进的方法相比，所提出的模型显示出有竞争力的降噪性能。
