##### Abstract
This thesis describes the design and implementation of a smile detector based on deep convolutional neural networks. It starts with a summary of neural networks, the difficulties of training them and new training methods, such as Restricted Boltzmann Machines or autoencoders. It then provides a literature review of convolutional neural networks and recurrent neural networks. In order to select databases for smile recognition, comprehensive statistics of databases popular in the field of facial expression recognition were generated and are summarized in this thesis. It then proposes a model for smile detection, of which the main part is implemented. The experimental results are discussed in this thesis and justified based on a comprehensive model selection performed. All experiments were run on a Tesla K40c GPU benefiting from a speedup of up to factor 10 over the computations on a CPU. A smile detection test accuracy of 99.45% is achieved for the Denver Intensity of Spontaneous Facial Action (DISFA) database, significantly outperforming existing approaches with accuracies ranging from 65.55% to 79.67%. This experiment is re-run under various variations, such as retaining less neutral images or only the low or high intensities, of which the results are extensively compared.

本文描述了基于深度卷积神经网络的微笑检测器的设计与实现。它从神经网络的概述开始，训练它们的困难和新的训练方法，例如限制玻尔兹曼机器或自动编码器。然后提供卷积神经网络和递归神经网络的文献综述。为了选择数据库进行笑脸识别，本文对面部表情识别领域中流行的数据库进行了综合统计，并进行了总结。然后提出了一个微笑检测模型，其中主要部分是实现的。本文对实验结果进行了讨论，并基于全面的模型选择进行了验证。所有的实验都运行在Tesla K40c GPU上，CPU的运算速度高达10倍。丹佛自发性面部紧张度（DISFA）数据库的微笑检测测试准确率达到了99.45％，显着优于现有方法，准确率从65.55％到79.67％不等。该实验在各种变化下重新运行，例如保留较少的中性图像或只有较低或较高的强度，其结果被广泛地比较。
