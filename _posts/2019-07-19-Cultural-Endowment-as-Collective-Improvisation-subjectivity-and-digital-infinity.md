##### Abstract
Philosophically, a repertoire of signifying practices as constitutive of a cultural endowment was said to be ambiguous or unworthy of pursuit. Currently, a unique capacity of the mind is considered to be its ability to produce a digital infinity. The infinity produced, here an operation expressing subjectivity, follows a simple principle according to which a limited set of means, here functions, are utilized to produce an infinite range of potentially meaningful expressions. It is from this concept that I propose a theory of subjectivity and the endowment from which it expresses a self in the world(s) it participates. In particular, I make a case for the subjectivity of blackness. I treat subjectivity as an operation in order to address problems with Identity theory, Afro-Pessimism, and to formalize an analysis of blackness despite the onto-epistemological commitments of racialized systems of categorization. In sum, subjectivity will be characterized as poetic computation.
