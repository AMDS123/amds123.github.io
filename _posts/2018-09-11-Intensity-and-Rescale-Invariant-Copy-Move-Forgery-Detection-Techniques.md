##### Abstract
In this contemporary world digital media such as videos and images behave as an active medium to carry valuable information across the globe on all fronts. However there are several techniques evolved to tamper the image which has made their authenticity untrustworthy. CopyMove Forgery CMF is one of the most common forgeries present in an image where a cluster of pixels are duplicated in the same image with potential postprocessing techniques. Various state-of-art techniques are developed in the recent years which are effective in detecting passive image forgery. However most methods do fail when the copied image is rescaled or added with certain intensity before being pasted due to de-synchronization of pixels in the searching process. To tackle this problem the paper proposes distinct novel algorithms which recognize a unique approach of using Hus invariant moments and Discreet Cosine Transformations DCT to attain the desired rescale invariant and intensity invariant CMF detection techniques respectively. The experiments conducted quantitatively and qualitatively demonstrate the effectiveness of the algorithm.

在当今世界，视频和图像等数字媒体就像一种活跃的媒介，可以在全球范围内传播有价值的信息。然而，有几种技术演变为篡改图像，这使得它们的真实性不值得信任。 CopyMove Forgery CMF是图像中最常见的伪造品之一，其中像素簇在具有潜在后处理技术的同一图像中复制。近年来开发了各种现有技术，这些技术在检测被动图像伪造方面是有效的。然而，由于搜索过程中像素的去同步，当复制的图像在被粘贴之前被重新调整或添加一定强度时，大多数方法都会失败。为了解决这个问题，本文提出了独特的新算法，这些算法识别使用Hus不变矩和Discreet余弦变换DCT的独特方法，分别获得所需的重新定标不变和强度不变CMF检测技术。实验定量和定性地证明了算法的有效性。
