##### Abstract
Purpose: To develop a general phase regularized image reconstruction method, with applications to partial Fourier imaging, water-fat imaging and flow imaging. Theory and Methods: The problem of enforcing phase constraints in reconstruction was studied under a regularized inverse problem framework. A general phase regularized reconstruction algorithm was proposed to enable various joint reconstruction of partial Fourier imaging, water-fat imaging and flow imaging, along with parallel imaging (PI) and compressed sensing (CS). Since phase regularized reconstruction is inherently non-convex and sensitive to phase wraps in the initial solution, a reconstruction technique, named phase cycling, was proposed to render the overall algorithm invariant to phase wraps. The proposed method was applied to retrospectively under-sampled in vivo datasets and compared with state of the art reconstruction methods. Results: Phase cycling reconstructions showed reduction of artifacts compared to reconstructions with- out phase cycling and achieved similar performances as state of the art results in partial Fourier, water-fat and divergence-free regularized flow reconstruction. Joint reconstruction of partial Fourier + water-fat imaging + PI + CS, and partial Fourier + divergence-free regularized flow imaging + PI + CS were demonstrated. Conclusion: The proposed phase cycling reconstruction provides an alternative way to perform phase regularized reconstruction, without the need to perform phase unwrapping. It is robust to the choice of initial solutions and encourages the joint reconstruction of phase imaging applications.

目的：研制一种通用相位正则化的图像重建方法，并应用于局部傅里叶成像，水脂成像和流动成像。理论与方法：在正则化反问题框架下，研究了重构中执行相位约束的问题。提出了一种通用的相位正则化重建算法，以实现局部傅里叶成像，水脂成像和流动成像的各种联合重建，并行成像（PI）和压缩感知（CS）。由于相位正则化重构本质上是非凸的，并且对初始解中的相位缠绕敏感，所以提出了称为相位循环的重构技术，以使整个算法不变为相位缠绕。所提出的方法被应用于回顾性欠采样的体内数据集并与现有技术的重建方法进行比较。结果：阶段循环重建显示与没有阶段循环的重建相比伪影减少，并且获得了与部分傅立叶，水脂肪和无发散正则流重建中的现有技术结果类似的性能。演示了部分傅里叶+水脂成像+ PI + CS联合重建，部分傅里叶+无发散正则流动成像+ PI + CS联合重建。结论：所提出的阶段循环重建提供了执行阶段正则化重建的替代方式，而不需要执行相位解缠。它对初始解决方案的选择是强大的，并鼓励相位成像应用的联合重建。
