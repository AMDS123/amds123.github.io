##### Abstract
We evaluate performance of associative memory in a neural network by based on the singular value decomposition (SVD) of image data stored in the network. We consider the situation in which the original image and its highly coarse-grained one by SVD are stored in the network and the intermediate one is taken as an input. We find that the performance is characterized by the snapshot-entropy scaling inherent in the SVD: the network retrieves the original image when the entropy of the input image is larger than the critical value determined from the scaling. The result indicates efficiency of the SVD as a criterion of the performance and also indicates universality of the scaling for realistic problems beyond theoretical physics.

我们通过基于存储在网络中的图像数据的奇异值分解（SVD）来评估神经网络中的联想记忆的性能。我们考虑将SVD中原始图像及其高粗粒度图像存储在网络中，将中间图像作为输入的情况。我们发现，性能的特点是SVD固有的快照 - 熵比例：当输入图像的熵大于缩放确定的临界值时，网络检索原始图像。结果表明，奇异值分解的效率作为性能的一个标准，也表明了理论物理以外现实问题的标度的普遍性。
