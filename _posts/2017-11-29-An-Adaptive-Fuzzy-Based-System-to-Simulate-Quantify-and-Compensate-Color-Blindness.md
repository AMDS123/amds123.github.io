##### Abstract
About 8% of the male population of the world are affected by a determined type of color vision disturbance, which varies from the partial to complete reduction of the ability to distinguish certain colors. A considerable amount of color blind people are able to live all life long without knowing they have color vision disabilities and abnormalities. Nowadays the evolution of information technology and computer science, specifically image processing techniques and computer graphics, can be fundamental to aid at the development of adaptive color blindness correction tools. This paper presents a software tool based on Fuzzy Logic to evaluate the type and the degree of color blindness a person suffer from. In order to model several degrees of color blindness, herein this work we modified the classical linear transform-based simulation method by the use of fuzzy parameters. We also proposed four new methods to correct color blindness based on a fuzzy approach: Methods A and B, with and without histogram equalization. All the methods are based on combinations of linear transforms and histogram operations. In order to evaluate the results we implemented a web-based survey to get the best results according to optimize to distinguish different elements in an image. Results obtained from 40 volunteers proved that the Method B with histogram equalization got the best results for about 47% of volunteers.

世界上约有8％的男性人口受到确定类型的色觉障碍的影响，其从局部到完全减少区分某些颜色的能力是不同的。相当数量的色盲人能够终身生活，而不知道他们有色觉障碍和异常。如今信息技术和计算机科学的发展，特别是图像处理技术和计算机图形学，对于帮助自适应色盲校正工具的发展至关重要。本文提出了一种基于模糊逻辑的软件工具来评估一个人的色盲类型和程度。为了模拟多个色盲程度，本文使用模糊参数修改了经典的基于线性变换的仿真方法。我们还提出了四种基于模糊方法校正色盲的新方法：方法A和方法B，有和没有直方图均衡。所有的方法都是基于线性变换和直方图操作的组合。为了评估结果，我们实施了基于网络的调查，以根据优化以获得最佳结果来区分图像中的不同元素。从40名志愿者获得的结果证明，采用直方图均衡化的方法B对约47％的志愿者获得了最好的结果。
