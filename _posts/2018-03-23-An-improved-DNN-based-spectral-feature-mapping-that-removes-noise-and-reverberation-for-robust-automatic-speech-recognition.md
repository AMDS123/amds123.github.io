##### Abstract
Reverberation and additive noise have detrimental effects on the performance of automatic speech recognition systems. In this paper we explore the ability of a DNN-based spectral feature mapping to remove the effects of reverberation and additive noise. Experiments with the CHiME-2 database show that this DNN can achieve an average reduction in WER of 4.5%, when compared to the baseline system, at SNRs equal to -6 dB, -3 dB, 0 dB and 3 dB, and just 0.8% at greater SNRs of 6 dB and 9 dB. These results suggest that this DNN is more effective in removing additive noise than reverberation. To improve the DNN performance, we combine it with the weighted prediction error (WPE) method that shows a complementary behavior. While this combination provided a reduction in WER of approximately 11% when compared with the baseline, the observed improvement is not as great as that obtained using WPE alone. However, modifications to the DNN training process were applied and an average reduction in WER equal to 18.3% was achieved when compared with the baseline system. Furthermore, the improved DNN combined with WPE achieves a reduction in WER of 7.9% when compared with WPE alone.

混响和加性噪声对自动语音识别系统的性能有不利影响。在本文中，我们探讨了基于DNN的谱特征映射消除混响效应和加性噪声的能力。使用CHiME-2数据库进行的实验表明，与基准系统相比，此DNN的WER平均降低4.5％，SNR等于-6 dB，-3 dB，0 dB和3dB，而​​且仅为0.8 ％在6 dB和9 dB的更高信噪比下。这些结果表明，这种DNN在消除附加噪声方面比混响更有效。为了提高DNN性能，我们将它与显示补充行为的加权预测误差（WPE）方法结合起来。尽管与基线相比，这种组合提供了约11％的WER降低，但观察到的改善不如使用WPE单独获得的改善。但是，对DNN培训过程进行了修改，与基线系统相比，WER平均降低了18.3％。此外，与WPE相比，改进的DNN与WPE结合可使WER降低7.9％。
