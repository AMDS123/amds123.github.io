##### Abstract
Building Information Modeling (BIM) is a recent construction process based on a 3D model, containing every component related to the building achievement. Architects, structure engineers, method engineers, and others participant to the building process work on this model through the design-to-construction cycle. The high complexity and the large amount of information included in these models raise several issues, delaying its wide adoption in the industrial world. One of the most important is the visualization: professionals have difficulties to find out the relevant information for their job. Actual solutions suffer from two limitations: the BIM models information are processed manually and insignificant information are simply hidden, leading to inconsistencies in the building model. This paper describes a system relying on an ontological representation of the building information to label automatically the building elements. Depending on the user's department, the visualization is modified according to these labels by automatically adjusting the colors and image properties based on a saliency model. The proposed saliency model incorporates several adaptations to fit the specificities of architectural images.

建筑信息模型（BIM）是一个基于3D模型的最近建造过程，包含与建筑成就相关的每个组件。建筑师，结构工程师，方法工程师和参与建筑过程的其他人员通过设计到施工周期在此模型上工作。这些模型中包含的高度复杂性和大量的信息提出了一些问题，推迟了其在工业领域的广泛应用。其中最重要的是可视化：专业人士很难找到相关的工作信息。实际的解决方案受到两个限制：BIM模型信息被手动处理，而不重要的信息被简单地隐藏起来，导致建筑模型中的不一致。本文描述了一个系统依赖于建筑信息的本体论表示来自动标记建筑元素。根据用户的部门，通过基于显着性模型自动调整颜色和图像属性，根据这些标签修改可视化。所提出的显着性模型结合了适应建筑图像特征的几种适应性。
