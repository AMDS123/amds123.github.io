##### Abstract
With the railway transportation Industry moving actively towards automation, accurate location and inventory of wayside track assets like traffic signals, crossings, switches, mileposts, etc. is of extreme importance. With the new Positive Train Control (PTC) regulation coming into effect, many railway safety rules will be tied directly to location of assets like mileposts and signals. Newer speed regulations will be enforced based on location of the Train with respect to a wayside asset. Hence it is essential for the railroads to have an accurate database of the types and locations of these assets. This paper talks about a real-world use-case of detecting railway signals from a camera mounted on a moving locomotive and tracking their locations. The camera is engineered to withstand the environment factors on a moving train and provide a consistent steady image at around 30 frames per second. Using advanced image analysis and deep learning techniques, signals are detected in these camera images and a database of their locations is created. Railway signals differ a lot from road signals in terms of shapes and rules for placement with respect to track. Due to space constraint and traffic densities in urban areas signals are not placed on the same side of the track and multiple lines can run in parallel. Hence there is need to associate signal detected with the track on which the train runs. We present a method to associate the signals to the specific track they belong to using a video feed from the front facing camera mounted on the lead locomotive. A pipeline of track detection, region of interest selection, signal detection has been implemented which gives an overall accuracy of 94.7% on a route covering 150km with 247 signals.

随着铁路运输业向自动化方向发展，交通信号，十字路口，交换机，里程碑等路边资产的准确定位和库存显得尤为重要。随着新的积极列车控制（PTC）法规的生效，许多铁路安全规则将直接与里程碑和信号等资产的位置相关联。较新的速度规定将根据列车在路边资产的位置执行。因此，铁路必须有这些资产类型和位置的准确数据库。本文讨论了一个真实世界的用例，它检测安装在移动机车上的摄像机的铁路信号，并跟踪它们的位置。相机的设计能够承受移动火车上的环境因素，并以每秒30帧的速度提供一致的稳定图像。使用先进的图像分析和深度学习技术，在这些摄像机图像中检测到信号，并创建其位置的数据库。铁路信号与道路信号在形状和轨道放置规则方面有很大不同。由于城市空间限制和交通密度，信号不会放在轨道的同一侧，多条线路可以并行运行。因此，需要将检测到的信号与列车运行的轨道相关联。我们提出了一种方法，使用安装在领头机车上的前置摄像头的视频馈送将信号与它们所属的特定轨道相关联。轨道检测，感兴趣区域选择，信号检测等管道已经实现，在覆盖150km，247路信号的路线上，总体精度达到了94.7％。
