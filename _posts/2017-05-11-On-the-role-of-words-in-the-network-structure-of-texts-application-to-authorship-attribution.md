##### Abstract
Well-established automatic analyses of texts mainly consider frequencies of linguistic units, e.g. letters, words and bigrams, while methods based on co-occurrence networks consider the structure of texts regardless of the nodes label (i.e. the words semantics). In this paper, we reconcile these distinct viewpoints by introducing a generalized similarity measure to compare texts which accounts for both the network structure of texts and the role of individual words in the networks. We use the similarity measure for authorship attribution of three collections of books, each composed of 8 authors and 10 books per author. High accuracy rates were obtained with typical values from 90% to 98.75%, much higher than with the traditional the TF-IDF approach for the same collections. These accuracies are also higher than taking only the topology of networks into account. We conclude that the different properties of specific words on the macroscopic scale structure of a whole text are as relevant as their frequency of appearance; conversely, considering the identity of nodes brings further knowledge about a piece of text represented as a network.

##### Abstract (translated by Google)
完善的文本自动分析主要考虑语言单位的频率，例如，字母和单词，而基于共现网络的方法考虑了文本的结构而不考虑节点标签（即单词语义）。在本文中，我们通过引入一个广义的相似性度量来比较这些不同的观点，以比较既考虑文本的网络结构又考虑网络中单个词的作用的文本。我们使用三种书籍作者归属的相似性度量，每个作者由8位作者和10本书组成。准确率高达90％到98.75％，远高于传统的TF-IDF方法。这些精度也高于仅考虑网络的拓扑结构。我们得出这样的结论：整个文本的宏观尺度结构上的特定词的不同特性与其出现的频率是相关的;相反，考虑到节点的身份带来的进一步的知识有关的一段文字表示为一个网络。
