##### Abstract
Recently, pose-based action recognition has gained more and more attention due to the better performance compared with traditional appearance-based methods. However, there still exist two problems to be further solved. First, existing pose-based methods generally recognize human actions with captured 3D human poses which are very difficult to obtain in real scenarios. Second, few pose-based methods model the action-related objects in recognizing human-object interaction actions in which objects play an important role. To solve the problems above, we propose a pose-based two-stream relational network (PSRN) for action recognition. In PSRN, one stream models the temporal dynamics of the targeted 2D human pose sequences which are directly extracted from raw videos, and the other stream models the action-related objects from a randomly sampled video frame. Most importantly, instead of fusing two-streams in the class score layer as before, we propose a pose-object relational network to model the relationship between human poses and action-related objects. We evaluate the proposed PSRN on two challenging benchmarks, i.e., Sub-JHMDB and PennAction. Experimental results show that our PSRN obtains the state-the-of-art performance on Sub-JHMDB (80.2%) and PennAction (98.1%). Our work opens a new door to action recognition by combining 2D human pose extracted from raw video and image appearance.

最近，基于姿态的动作识别由于与传统的基于外观的方法相比具有更好的性能而受到越来越多的关注。但是，还有两个问题需要进一步解决。首先，现有的基于姿势的方法通常识别人类的动作，捕获的3D人体姿势在实际场景中很难获得。其次，很少有基于姿势的方法将动作相关对象建模为识别对象在其中扮演重要角色的人对象交互动作。为了解决上述问题，我们提出了一种基于姿态的双流关系网络（PSRN）来进行动作识别。在PSRN中，一个流模拟直接从原始视频中提取的目标2D人体姿态序列的时间动态，另一个流模拟随机采样视频帧中与动作相关的对象。最重要的是，我们不是像以前那样在课堂评分层中融合两个流，而是提出了一个姿势 - 对象关系网络来模拟人体姿势和动作相关对象之间的关系。我们根据两个具有挑战性的基准评估建议的PSRN，即Sub-JHMDB和PennAction。实验结果表明，我们的PSRN在Sub-JHMDB（80.2％）和PennAction（98.1％）上获得了最先进的性能。我们的工作结合了从原始视频和图像外观中提取的2D人体姿态，为行动识别开辟了一扇新门。
