##### Abstract
Air travel is one of the fastest growing modes of transportation, however, the effects of aircraft noise on populations surrounding airports is hindering its growth. In an effort to study and ultimately mitigate the impact that this noise has, many airports continuously monitor the aircraft noise in their surrounding communities. Noise monitoring and analysis is complicated by the fact that aircraft are not the only source of noise. In this work, we show that a Convolutional Neural Network is well-suited for the task of identifying noise events which are not caused by aircraft. Our system achieves an accuracy of 0.970 when trained on 900 manually labeled noise events. Our training data and a TensorFlow implementation of our model are available at https://github.com/neheller/aircraftnoise.

航空旅行是增长最快的交通方式之一，但是，飞机噪音对机场周围人群的影响阻碍了其增长。为了研究并最终减轻噪音带来的影响，许多机场不断监测周围社区的飞机噪音。噪音监测和分析由于飞机不是噪音的唯一来源而变得复杂。在这项工作中，我们证明了卷积神经网络非常适合识别非飞机引起的噪音事件。我们的系统在900个手动标记的噪音事件的训练中达到0.970的准确度。我们的训练数据和我们模型的TensorFlow实现可在https://github.com/neheller/aircraftnoise上找到。
