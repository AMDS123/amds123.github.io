##### Abstract
Recently, resources and tasks were proposed to go beyond state tracking in dialogue systems. An example is the frame tracking task, which requires recording multiple frames, one for each user goal set during the dialogue. This allows a user, for instance, to compare items corresponding to different goals. This paper proposes a model which takes as input the list of frames created so far during the dialogue, the current user utterance as well as the dialogue acts, slot types, and slot values associated with this utterance. The model then outputs the frame being referenced by each triple of dialogue act, slot type, and slot value. We show that on the recently published Frames dataset, this model significantly outperforms a previously proposed rule-based baseline. In addition, we propose an extensive analysis of the frame tracking task by dividing it into sub-tasks and assessing their difficulty with respect to our model.

最近，资源和任务被提出超越对话系统中的状态跟踪。帧跟踪任务就是一个例子，它需要记录多个帧，每个用户在对话期间设置一个目标。这允许用户例如比较对应于不同目标的项目。本文提出了一个模型，该模型将对话期间迄今为止创建的帧的列表作为输入，当前用户话语以及与该话语相关联的对话行为，时隙类型和时隙值。然后模型输出由对话动作，时隙类型和时隙值的每个三元组引用的帧。我们显示，在最近发布的框架数据集，这个模型显着优于以前提出的基于规则的基准。此外，我们还提出了一个框架跟踪任务的广泛分析，将其分为子任务和评估他们在模型方面的困难。
