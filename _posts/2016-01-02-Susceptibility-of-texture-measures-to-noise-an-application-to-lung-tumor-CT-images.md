##### Abstract
Five different texture methods are used to investigate their susceptibility to subtle noise occurring in lung tumor Computed Tomography (CT) images caused by acquisition and reconstruction deficiencies. Noise of Gaussian and Rayleigh distributions with varying mean and variance was encountered in the analyzed CT images. Fisher and Bhattacharyya distance measures were used to differentiate between an original extracted lung tumor region of interest (ROI) with a filtered and noisy reconstructed versions. Through examining the texture characteristics of the lung tumor areas by five different texture measures, it was determined that the autocovariance measure was least affected and the gray level co-occurrence matrix was the most affected by noise. Depending on the selected ROI size, it was concluded that the number of extracted features from each texture measure increases susceptibility to noise.

采用五种不同的纹理方法来研究它们对由获取和重构缺陷引起的肺肿瘤CT图像中的微妙噪声的易感性。在分析的CT图像中遇到了具有变化的均值和方差的高斯和瑞利分布的噪声。 Fisher和Bhattacharyya距离测量被用于区分原始提取的肺肿瘤感兴趣区域（ROI）和经过滤和噪声重建的版本。通过五种不同的纹理测量来检测肺肿瘤区域的纹理特征，确定自协方差测度受影响最小，灰度共生矩阵受噪声影响最大。根据选定的ROI大小，可以得出结论，从每个纹理测量中提取的特征的数量增加了对噪声的易感性。
