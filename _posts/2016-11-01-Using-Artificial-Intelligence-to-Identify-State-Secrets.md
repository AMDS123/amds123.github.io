##### Abstract
Whether officials can be trusted to protect national security information has become a matter of great public controversy, reigniting a long-standing debate about the scope and nature of official secrecy. The declassification of millions of electronic records has made it possible to analyze these issues with greater rigor and precision. Using machine-learning methods, we examined nearly a million State Department cables from the 1970s to identify features of records that are more likely to be classified, such as international negotiations, military operations, and high-level communications. Even with incomplete data, algorithms can use such features to identify 90% of classified cables with <11% false positives. But our results also show that there are longstanding problems in the identification of sensitive information. Error analysis reveals many examples of both overclassification and underclassification. This indicates both the need for research on inter-coder reliability among officials as to what constitutes classified material and the opportunity to develop recommender systems to better manage both classification and declassification.

官员是否可以信任保护国家安全信息已经成为公众争议的焦点，重新就官方保密的范围和性质再次争论不休。数以百万计的电子记录的解密使人们有可能更加严谨和精确地分析这些问题。使用机器学习方法，我们检查了上个世纪70年代的近百万条国务院电报，以确定更有可能被分类的记录的特征，例如国际谈判，军事行动和高层交流。即使数据不完整，算法也可以使用这些特征来识别90％的分类电缆，误报率<11％。但是，我们的研究结果也表明，在识别敏感信息方面长期存在问题。错误分析揭示了过度分类和低分类的许多例子。这表明需要对官员之间的编码器间可靠性进行研究，以确定哪些构成分类资料，以及有可能开发推荐系统以更好地管理分类和解密。
