##### Abstract
We present an overview of the CLEF-2018 CheckThat! Lab on Automatic Identification and Verification of Political Claims, with focus on Task 1: Check-Worthiness. The task asks to predict which claims in a political debate should be prioritized for fact-checking. In particular, given a debate or a political speech, the goal was to produce a ranked list of its sentences based on their worthiness for fact checking. We offered the task in both English and Arabic, based on debates from the 2016 US Presidential Campaign, as well as on some speeches during and after the campaign. A total of 30 teams registered to participate in the Lab and seven teams actually submitted systems for Task~1. The most successful approaches used by the participants relied on recurrent and multi-layer neural networks, as well as on combinations of distributional representations, on matchings claims' vocabulary against lexicons, and on measures of syntactic dependency. The best systems achieved mean average precision of 0.18 and 0.15 on the English and on the Arabic test datasets, respectively. This leaves large room for further improvement, and thus we release all datasets and the scoring scripts, which should enable further research in check-worthiness estimation.

我们概述了CLEF-2018 CheckThat！关于自动识别和验证政治索赔的实验室，重点是任务1：检查 - 值得。该任务要求预测政治辩论中的哪些主张应该优先考虑事实。特别是，在辩论或政治演讲的情况下，目标是根据其对事实核查的价值来制作其句子的排序列表。根据2016年美国总统竞选的辩论，以及竞选期间和之后的一些演讲，我们提供了英语和阿拉伯语的任务。共有30个团队注册参加实验室，7个团队实际提交了Task~1系统。参与者使用的最成功的方法依赖于循环和多层神经网络，以及分布表示的组合，匹配声明对词典的词汇，以及句法依赖的度量。所获得的最佳系统分别在英语和阿拉伯语测试数据集上的平均精度为0.18和0.15。这为进一步改进留下了很大的空间，因此我们发布了所有数据集和评分脚本，这将有助于进一步研究校验价值。
