##### Abstract
Morphological, optical and transport properties of GaN and InN nanowires grown by molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) have been studied. The differences between the two materials in respect to growth parameters and optimization procedure was stressed. The nanowires crystalline quality has been investigated by means of their optical properties. A comparison of the transport characteristics was given. For each material a band schema was shown, which takes into account transport and optical features and is based on Fermi level pinning at the surface.
