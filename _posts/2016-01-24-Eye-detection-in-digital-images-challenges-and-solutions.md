##### Abstract
Eye Detection has an important role in the field of biometric identification and known as one method of person's identification. In recent years, many efforts have been done which can detect eye automatically and with different image conditions. However, each method has its own drawbacks which can control some of these conditions. In this paper, different methods of eye detection will be categorized and explained. In each category, the advantages and disadvantages of each method will be presented.
