##### Abstract
Kernelized Correlation Filter (KCF) is one of the state-of-the-art object trackers. However, it does not reasonably model the distribution of correlation response during tracking process, which might cause the drifting problem, especially when targets undergo significant appearance changes due to occlusion, camera shaking, and/or deformation. In this paper, we propose an Output Constraint Transfer (OCT) method that by modeling the distribution of correlation response in a Bayesian optimization framework is able to mitigate the drifting problem. OCT builds upon the reasonable assumption that the correlation response to the target image follows a Gaussian distribution, which we exploit to select training samples and reduce model uncertainty. OCT is rooted in a new theory which transfers data distribution to a constraint of the optimized variable, leading to an efficient framework to calculate correlation filters. Extensive experiments on a commonly used tracking benchmark show that the proposed method significantly improves KCF, and achieves better performance than other state-of-the-art trackers. To encourage further developments, the source code is made available this https URL

##### Abstract (translated by Google)
核化相关滤波器（KCF）是最先进的目标跟踪器之一。但是，在追踪过程中，不能合理地模拟相关响应的分布，这可能会引起漂移问题，特别是当目标由于遮挡，相机抖动和/或变形而发生明显的外观变化时。在本文中，我们提出了一种输出约束传输（OCT）方法，通过建模贝叶斯优化框架中相关响应的分布可以减轻漂移问题。 OCT建立在对目标图像的相关响应遵循高斯分布的合理假设之上，我们利用该高斯分布来选择训练样本并减少模型不确定性。 OCT植根于将数据分布转化为优化变量约束的新理论，导致计算相关滤波器的有效框架。对常用跟踪基准进行的大量实验表明，所提出的方法显着提高了KCF，并且实现了比其他最先进的跟踪器更好的性能。为了鼓励进一步的发展，源代码提供了这个https URL
