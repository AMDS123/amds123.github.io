##### Abstract
We present a feature engineering pipeline for the construction of musical signal characteristics, to be used for the design of a supervised model for musical genre identification. The key idea is to extend the traditional two-step process of extraction and classification with additive stand-alone phases which are no longer organized in a waterfall scheme. The whole system is realized by traversing backtrack arrows and cycles between various stages. In order to give a compact and effective representation of the features, the standard early temporal integration is combined with other selection and extraction phases: on the one hand, the selection of the most meaningful characteristics based on information gain, and on the other hand, the inclusion of the nonlinear correlation between this subset of features, determined by an autoencoder. The results of the experiments conducted on GTZAN dataset reveal a noticeable contribution of this methodology towards the model's performance in classification task.

我们提出了一个特征工程流水线来构建音乐信号特征，用于音乐流派识别的监督模型的设计。关键的想法是扩展传统的两步提取和分类过程，其中添加式独立阶段不再以瀑布方案组织。整个系统通过遍历各个阶段之间的回溯箭头和循环来实现。为了给出特征的紧凑和有效的表示，标准早期时间积分与其他选择和提取阶段相结合：一方面，基于信息增益选择最有意义的特征，另一方面，该特征子集之间包含非线性相关性，由自动编码器确定。在GTZAN数据集上进行的实验结果揭示了该方法对分类任务中模型性能的显着贡献。
