##### Abstract
Laminate mechanisms are a reliable concept in producing lowcost robots for educational and commercial purposes. These mechanisms are produced using low-cost manufacturing techniques which have improved significantly during recent years and are more accessible to novices and hobbyists. However, iterating through the design space to come up with the best design for a robot is still a time consuming and rather expensive task and therefore, there is still a need for model-based analysis before manufacturing. Until now, there has been no integrated design and analysis software for laminate robots. This paper addresses some of the issues surrounding laminate analysis by introducing a companion to an existing laminate design tool that automates the generation of dynamic equations and produces simulation results via rendered plots and videos. We have validated the accuracy of the software by comparing the position, velocity and acceleration of the simulated mechanisms with the measurements taken from physical laminate prototypes using a motion capture system.

层压机构是用于教育和商业目的的低成本机器人的可靠概念。这些机制是使用低成本制造技术生产的，这些技术近年来得到了显着改善，新手和业余爱好者更容易获得。然而，迭代设计空间以提出机器人的最佳设计仍然是耗时且相当昂贵的任务，因此，在制造之前仍然需要基于模型的分析。到目前为止，还没有用于层压机器人的集成设计和分析软件。本文通过引入现有层压板设计工具的配套文件解决了层压板分析的一些问题，该工具可自动生成动态方程，并通过渲染图和视频生成模拟结果。我们通过比较模拟机构的位置，速度和加速度以及使用运动捕捉系统从物理层压板原型获得的测量结果来验证软件的准确性。
