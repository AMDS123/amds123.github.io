##### Abstract
Weather conditions often disrupt the proper functioning of transportation systems. Present systems either deploy an array of sensors or use an in-vehicle camera to predict weather conditions. These solutions have resulted in incremental cost and limited scope. To ensure smooth operation of all transportation services in all-weather conditions, a reliable detection system is necessary to classify weather in wild. The challenges involved in solving this problem is that weather conditions are diverse in nature and there is an absence of discriminate features among various weather conditions. The existing works to solve this problem have been scene specific and have targeted classification of two categories of weather. In this paper, we have created a new open source dataset consisting of images depicting three classes of weather i.e rain, snow and fog called RFS Dataset. A novel algorithm has also been proposed which has used super pixel delimiting masks as a form of data augmentation, leading to reasonable results with respect to ten Convolutional Neural Network architectures.

天气条件经常破坏运输系统的正常运行。目前的系统要么部署传感器阵列，要么使用车载摄像头来预测天气状况。这些解决方案导致成本增加且范围有限。为了确保在全天候条件下所有运输服务的顺利运行，需要一个可靠的检测系统来对野外天气进行分类。解决这个问题所涉及的挑战是天气状况本质上是多样的，并且在各种天气条件下没有区别特征。解决这个问题的现有工作已经是场景特定的并且具有针对两类天气的目标分类。在本文中，我们创建了一个新的开源数据集，其中包含描述三类天气的图像，即雨，雪和雾，称为RFS数据集。还提出了一种新算法，其使用超像素定界掩模作为数据增强的形式，导致关于十个卷积神经网络架构的合理结果。
