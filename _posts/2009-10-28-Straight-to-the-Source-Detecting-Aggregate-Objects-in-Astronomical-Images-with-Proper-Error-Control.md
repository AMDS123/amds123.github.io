##### Abstract
The next generation of telescopes will acquire terabytes of image data on a nightly basis. Collectively, these large images will contain billions of interesting objects, which astronomers call sources. The astronomers' task is to construct a catalog detailing the coordinates and other properties of the sources. The source catalog is the primary data product for most telescopes and is an important input for testing new astrophysical theories, but to construct the catalog one must first detect the sources. Existing algorithms for catalog creation are effective at detecting sources, but do not have rigorous statistical error control. At the same time, there are several multiple testing procedures that provide rigorous error control, but they are not designed to detect sources that are aggregated over several pixels. In this paper, we propose a technique that does both, by providing rigorous statistical error control on the aggregate objects themselves rather than the pixels. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach on data from the Chandra X-ray Observatory Satellite. Our technique effectively controls the rate of false sources, yet still detects almost all of the sources detected by procedures that do not have such rigorous error control and have the advantage of additional data in the form of follow up observations, which will not be available for upcoming large telescopes. In fact, we even detect a new source that was missed by previous studies. The statistical methods developed in this paper can be extended to problems beyond Astronomy, as we will illustrate with an example from Neuroimaging.

##### Abstract (translated by Google)
下一代望远镜每晚将获取太字节的图像数据。这些巨大的图像集合在一起将包含数十亿有趣的天文学家称之为来源的物体。天文学家的任务是建立一个详细的来源坐标和其他属性的目录。源目录是大多数望远镜的主要数据产品，是测试新的天体物理学理论的重要输入，但构建目录必须首先检测源。目录创建的现有算法在检测源时是有效的，但是没有严格的统计错误控制。同时，有多个测试程序提供了严格的错误控制，但是它们并没有设计用来检测聚集在几个像素上的信号源。在本文中，我们提出了一种技术，通过对聚合对象本身而不是像素提供严格的统计错误控制。我们从钱德拉X射线天文台卫星的数据证明了这种方法的有效性。我们的技术有效地控制了错误的来源，但仍能检测到几乎所有的程序检测到的来源，这些程序没有严格的错误控制，并且以跟踪观察的形式具有附加数据的优点，即将到来的大型望远镜。事实上，我们甚至发现以前的研究中错过了一个新的来源。本文提出的统计方法可以扩展到超越天文学的问题，我们将以神经影像学为例进行说明。
