##### Abstract
Many robotics and mapping systems contain multiple sensors to perceive the environment. Extrinsic parameter calibration, the identification of the position and rotation transform between the frames of the different sensors, is critical to fuse data from different sensors. When obtaining multiple camera to camera, lidar to camera and lidar to lidar calibration results, inconsistencies are likely. We propose a graph-based method to refine the relative poses of the different sensors. We demonstrate our approach using our mapping robot platform, which features twelve sensors that are to be calibrated. The experimental results confirm that the proposed algorithm yields great performance.
