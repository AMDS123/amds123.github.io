##### Abstract
Due to object detection's close relationship with video analysis and image understanding, it has attracted much research attention in recent years. Traditional object detection methods are built on handcrafted features and shallow trainable architectures. Their performance easily stagnates by constructing complex ensembles which combine multiple low-level image features with high-level context from object detectors and scene classifiers. With the rapid development in deep learning, more powerful tools, which are able to learn semantic, high-level, deeper features, are introduced to address the problems existing in traditional architectures. These models behave differently in network architecture, training strategy and optimization function, etc. In this paper, we provide a review on deep learning based object detection frameworks. Our review begins with a brief introduction on the history of deep learning and its representative tool, namely Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). Then we focus on typical generic object detection architectures along with some modifications and useful tricks to improve detection performance further. As distinct specific detection tasks exhibit different characteristics, we also briefly survey several specific tasks, including salient object detection, face detection and pedestrian detection. Experimental analyses are also provided to compare various methods and draw some meaningful conclusions. Finally, several promising directions and tasks are provided to serve as guidelines for future work in both object detection and relevant neural network based learning systems.

由于物体检测与视频分析和图像理解的密切关系，近年来引起了很多研究的关注。传统的物体检测方法建立在手工制作的特征和浅层可训练的架构之上。通过构建复杂的集合，它们的性能很容易停滞不前，这些集合将多个低级图像特征与来自对象检测器和场景分类器的高级上下文相结合。随着深度学习的快速发展，引入了更强大的工具，这些工具能够学习语义，高级，更深层次的特征，以解决传统架构中存在的问题。这些模型在网络架构，培训策略和优化功能等方面表现不同。本文中，我们提供了基于深度学习的对象检测框架的评论。我们的回顾首先简要介绍了深度学习的历史及其代表性工具，即卷积神经网络（CNN）。然后，我们专注于典型的通用对象检测体系结构，以及一些修改和有用的技巧，以进一步提高检测性能。由于不同的特定检测任务表现出不同的特征，我们还简要地调查了几个具体的任务，包括显着物体检测，人脸检测和行人检测。还提供了实验分析以比较各种方法并得出一些有意义的结论。最后，提供了几个有希望的方向和任务，作为对象检测和基于相关神经网络的学习系统的未来工作的指导。
