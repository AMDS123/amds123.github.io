##### Abstract
Word embeddings have been found to capture a surprisingly rich amount of syntactic and semantic knowledge. However, it is not yet sufficiently well-understood how the relational knowledge that is implicitly encoded in word embeddings can be extracted in a reliable way. In this paper, we propose two probabilistic models to address this issue. The first model is based on the common relations-as-translations view, but is cast in a probabilistic setting. Our second model is based on the much weaker assumption that there is a linear relationship between the vector representations of related words. Compared to existing approaches, our models lead to more accurate predictions, and they are more explicit about what can and cannot be extracted from the word embedding.

已经发现词嵌入捕获了惊人的丰富的句法和语义知识。但是，如何以可靠的方式提取在词嵌入中隐式编码的关系知识，还没有充分理解。在本文中，我们提出了两个概率模型来解决这个问题。第一种模式是基于共同关系 - 作为翻译的观点，但被置于一个概率性的背景下。我们的第二个模型是基于相关词汇的向量表示之间存在线性关系的弱化假设。与现有的方法相比，我们的模型导致了更准确的预测，并且更加明确地说明了什么可以从词嵌入中提取。
