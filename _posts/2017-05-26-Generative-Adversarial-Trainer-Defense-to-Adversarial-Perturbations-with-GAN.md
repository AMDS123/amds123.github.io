##### Abstract
We propose a novel technique to make neural network robust to adversarial examples using a generative adversarial network. We alternately train both classifier and generator networks. The generator network generates an adversarial perturbation that can easily fool the classifier network by using a gradient of each image. Simultaneously, the classifier network is trained to classify correctly both original and adversarial images generated by the generator. These procedures help the classifier network to become more robust to adversarial perturbations. Furthermore, our adversarial training framework efficiently reduces overfitting and outperforms other regularization methods such as Dropout. We applied our method to supervised learning for CIFAR datasets, and experimantal results show that our method significantly lowers the generalization error of the network. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first method which uses GAN to improve supervised learning.
