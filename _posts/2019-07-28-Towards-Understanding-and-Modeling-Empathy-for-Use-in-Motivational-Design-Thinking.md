##### Abstract
Design Thinking workshops are used by companies to help generate new ideas for technologies and products by engaging subjects in exercises to understand their users' wants and become more empathetic towards their needs. The "aha moment" experienced during these thought-provoking, step outside the yourself activities occurs when a group of persons iterate over several problems and converge upon a solution that will fit seamlessly everyday life. With the increasing use and cost of Design workshops being offered, it is important that technology be developed that can help identify empathy and its onset in humans. This position paper presents an approach to modeling empathy using Gaussian mixture models and heart rate and skin conductance. This paper also presents an updated approach to Design Thinking that helps to ensure participants are thinking outside of their own race's, culture's, or other affiliations' motives.
