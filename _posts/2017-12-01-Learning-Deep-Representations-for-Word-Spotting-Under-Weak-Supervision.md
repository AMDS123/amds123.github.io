##### Abstract
Convolutional Neural Networks have made their mark in various fields of computer vision in recent years. They have achieved state-of-the-art performance in the field of document analysis as well. However, CNNs require a large amount of annotated training data and, hence, great manual effort. In our approach, we introduce a method to drastically reduce the manual annotation effort while retaining the high performance of a CNN for word spotting in handwritten documents. The model is learned with weak supervision using a combination of synthetically generated training data and a small subset of the training partition of the handwritten data set. We show that the network achieves results highly competitive to the state-of-the-art in word spotting with shorter training times and a fraction of the annotation effort.

卷积神经网络近年来在计算机视觉的各个领域都有所发展。他们也在文件分析领域取得了最先进的成果。然而，CNN需要大量的注释训练数据，因此需要大量的手动工作。在我们的方法中，我们引入了一种方法来大幅减少手工注释的工作量，同时保留手写文档中用于识别单词的CNN的高性能。使用综合生成的训练数据和手写数据集的训练分区的小子集的组合来弱监督地学习模型。我们表明，网络实现的结果极具竞争力，用最短的训练时间和注释努力的一小部分来进行单词识别。
