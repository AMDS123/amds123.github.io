##### Abstract
Neural models with minimal feature engineering have achieved competitive performance against traditional methods for the task of Chinese word segmentation. However, both training and working procedures of the current neural models are computationally inefficient. This paper presents a greedy neural word segmenter with balanced word and character embedding inputs to alleviate the existing drawbacks. Our segmenter is truly end-to-end, capable of performing segmentation much faster and even more accurate than state-of-the-art neural models on Chinese benchmark datasets.

最小特征工程的神经模型已经取得了与传统方法相媲美的中文分词任务的竞争性能。然而，目前的神经模型的训练和工作程序在计算上是低效的。本文提出了一个贪婪的神经词分词器，其中包含平衡词和字符嵌入的输入，以缓解现有的弊端。我们的分段器是真正端到端的，能够比中国基准数据集上的最先进的神经模型更快，更精确地进行分割。
