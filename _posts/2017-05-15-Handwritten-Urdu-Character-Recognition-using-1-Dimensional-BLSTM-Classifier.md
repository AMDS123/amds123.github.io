##### Abstract
The recognition of cursive script is regarded as a subtle task in optical character recognition due to its varied representation. Every cursive script has different nature and associated challenges. As Urdu is one of cursive language that is derived from Arabic script, thats why it nearly shares the same challenges and difficulties even more harder. We can categorized Urdu and Arabic language on basis of its script they use. Urdu is mostly written in Nastaliq style whereas, Arabic follows Naskh style of writing. This paper presents new and comprehensive Urdu handwritten offline database name Urdu-Nastaliq Handwritten Dataset (UNHD). Currently, there is no standard and comprehensive Urdu handwritten dataset available publicly for researchers. The acquired dataset covers commonly used ligatures that were written by 500 writers with their natural handwriting on A4 size paper. We performed experiments using recurrent neural networks and reported a significant accuracy for handwritten Urdu character recognition.

##### Abstract (translated by Google)
草书的识别由于其表现形式的多样性，被认为是光学字符识别的一个微妙任务。每一个草书都有不同的性质和相关的挑战。由于乌尔都语是阿拉伯文的草书，这就是为什么它几乎面临同样的挑战和困难更难。我们可以根据其使用的脚本对乌尔都语和阿拉伯语进行分类。乌尔都语大部分是用纳斯塔里格风格写成的，而阿拉伯语则遵循纳斯克风格的写作风格。本文提出新的和全面的乌尔都语手写离线数据库名称乌尔都语 -  Nastaliq手写数据集（UNHD）。目前，没有标准和全面的乌尔都语手写数据集公开给研究人员。获取的数据集涵盖了500名作家在A4尺寸纸张上自然书写的常用连字。我们使用循环神经网络进行实验，并报告了手写乌尔都语字符识别的显着准确性。
