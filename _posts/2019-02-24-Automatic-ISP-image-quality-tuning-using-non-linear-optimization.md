##### Abstract
Image Signal Processor (ISP) comprises of various blocks to reconstruct image sensor raw data to final image consumed by human visual system or computer vision applications. Each block typically has many tuning parameters due to the complexity of the operation. These need to be hand tuned by Image Quality (IQ) experts, which takes considerable amount of time. In this paper, we present an automatic IQ tuning using nonlinear optimization and automatic reference generation algorithms. The proposed method can produce high quality IQ in minutes as compared with weeks of hand-tuned results by IQ experts. In addition, the proposed method can work with any algorithms without being aware of their specific implementation. It was found successful on multiple different processing blocks such as noise reduction, demosaic, and sharpening.
