##### Abstract
Distributed surveillance systems have become popular in recent years due to security concerns. However, transmitting high dimensional data in bandwidth-limited distributed systems becomes a major challenge. In this paper, we address this issue by proposing a novel probabilistic algorithm based on the divergence between the probability distributions of the visual features in order to reduce their dimensionality and thus save the network bandwidth in distributed wireless smart camera networks. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach through extensive experiments on two surveillance recognition tasks.
