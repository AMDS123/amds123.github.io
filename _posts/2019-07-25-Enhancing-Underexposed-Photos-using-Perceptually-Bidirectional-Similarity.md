##### Abstract
This paper addresses the problem of enhancing underexposed photos. Existing methods have tackled this problem from many different perspectives and achieved remarkable progress. However, they may fail to produce satisfactory results due to the presence of visual artifacts such as color distortion, loss of details and uneven exposure, etc. To obtain high-quality results free of these artifacts, we present a novel underexposed photo enhancement approach in this paper. Our main observation is that, the reason why existing methods induce the artifacts is because they break a perceptual consistency between the input and the enhanced output. Based on this observation, an effective criterion, called perceptually bidirectional similarity (PBS) is proposed for preserving the perceptual consistency during enhancement. Particularly, we cast the underexposed photo enhancement as PBS-constrained illumination estimation optimization, where the PBS is defined as three constraints for estimating the illumination that can recover the enhancement results with normal exposure, distinct contrast, clear details and vivid color. To make our method more efficient and scalable to high-resolution images, we introduce a sampling-based strategy for accelerating the illumination estimation. Moreover, we extend our method to handle underexposed videos. Qualitative and quantitative comparisons as well as the user study demonstrate the superiority of our method over the state-of-the-art methods.
