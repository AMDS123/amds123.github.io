##### Abstract
This paper describes a novel approach to partially reconstruct high-resolution 4D light fields from a stack of differently focused photographs taken with a fixed camera. First, a focus map is calculated from this stack using a simple approach combining gradient detection and region expansion with graph-cut. Then, this focus map is converted into a depth map thanks to the calibration of the camera. We proceed after this with the tomographic reconstruction of the epipolar images by back-projecting the focused regions of the scene only. We call it masked back-projection. The angles of back-projection are calculated from the depth map. Thanks to the high angular resolution we achieve by suitably exploiting the image content captured over a large interval of focus distances, we are able to render puzzling perspective shifts although the original photographs were taken from a single fixed camera at a fixed position.

本文介绍了一种新的方法来部分重建高分辨率4D光场从一堆固定摄像机拍摄不同聚焦的照片。首先，使用将梯度检测和区域扩展与图形切割相结合的简单方法从这个堆栈计算焦点图。然后，由于摄像机的校准，此焦点图转换为深度图。我们之后通过仅对场景的聚焦区域进行反投影来进行核线图像的层析重建。我们称之为蒙板反投影。反投影的角度是从深度图计算出来的。由于我们通过适当地利用大范围焦距捕获的图像内容实现了高角度分辨率，尽管原始照片是从固定位置的单个固定相机拍摄的，但我们能够渲染令人迷惑的透视变化。
