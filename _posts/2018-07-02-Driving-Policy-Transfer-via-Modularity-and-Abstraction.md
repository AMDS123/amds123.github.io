##### Abstract
End-to-end approaches to autonomous driving have high sample complexity and are difficult to scale to realistic urban driving. Simulation can help end-to-end driving systems by providing a cheap, safe, and diverse training environment. Yet training driving policies in simulation brings up the problem of transferring such policies to the real world. We present an approach to transferring driving policies from simulation to reality via modularity and abstraction. Our approach is inspired by classic driving systems and aims to combine the benefits of modular architectures and end-to-end deep learning approaches. The key idea is to encapsulate the driving policy such that it is not directly exposed to raw perceptual input or low-level vehicle dynamics. We evaluate the presented approach in simulated urban environments and in the real world. In particular, we transfer a driving policy trained in simulation to a 1/5-scale robotic truck that is deployed in a variety of conditions, with no finetuning, on two continents.

##### Abstract (translated by Google)
自动驾驶的端到端方法具有高样本复杂性并且难以扩展到真实的城市驾驶。通过提供廉价，安全和多样化的培训环境，仿真可以帮助端到端的驾驶系统。然而，在模拟中培训驾驶政策会带来将这些政策转移到现实世界的问题。我们提出了一种通过模块化和抽象将驾驶政策从模拟转移到现实的方法。我们的方法受经典驾驶系统的启发，旨在结合模块化架构和端到端深度学习方法的优势。关键的想法是封装驾驶政策，使其不直接暴露于原始感知输入或低级车辆动态。我们在模拟城市环境和现实世界中评估所呈现的方法。特别是，我们将模拟训练的驾驶政策转移到1/5规模的机器人卡车，该卡车在各种条件下部署，在两个大陆上没有微调。补充视频可以在https://youtu.be/BrMDJqI6H5U查看
