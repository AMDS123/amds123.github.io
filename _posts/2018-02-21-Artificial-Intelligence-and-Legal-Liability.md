##### Abstract
A recent issue of a popular computing journal asked which laws would apply if a self-driving car killed a pedestrian. This paper considers the question of legal liability for artificially intelligent computer systems. It discusses whether criminal liability could ever apply; to whom it might apply; and, under civil law, whether an AI program is a product that is subject to product design legislation or a service to which the tort of negligence applies. The issue of sales warranties is also considered. A discussion of some of the practical limitations that AI systems are subject to is also included.

最近一期受欢迎的计算杂志问如果自动驾驶汽车杀死行人，哪些法律适用。本文考虑了人工智能计算机系统的法律责任问题。它讨论了是否可以适用刑事责任;可能适用于谁;并根据民法规定，AI计划是否属于产品设计立法的产品或适用于过失侵权行为的服务。还考虑了销售担保问题。还包括AI系统受到的一些实际限制的讨论。
