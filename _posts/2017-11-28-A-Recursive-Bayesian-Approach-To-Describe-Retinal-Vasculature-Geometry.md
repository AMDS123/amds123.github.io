##### Abstract
Demographic studies suggest that changes in the retinal vasculature geometry, especially in vessel width, are associated with the incidence or progression of eye-related or systemic diseases. To date, the main information source for width estimation from fundus images has been the intensity profile between vessel edges. However, there are many factors affecting the intensity profile: pathologies, the central light reflex and local illumination levels, to name a few. In this study, we introduce three information sources for width estimation. These are the probability profiles of vessel interior, centreline and edge locations generated by a deep network. The probability profiles provide direct access to vessel geometry and are used in the likelihood calculation for a Bayesian method, particle filtering. We also introduce a geometric model which can handle non-ideal conditions of the probability profiles. Our experiments conducted on the REVIEW dataset yielded consistent estimates of vessel width, even in cases when one of the vessel edges is difficult to identify. Moreover, our results suggest that the method is better than human observers at locating edges of low contrast vessels.

人口统计学研究表明，视网膜血管几何结构，特别是血管宽度的变化与眼部相关或全身性疾病的发生或发展有关。迄今为止，眼底图像宽度估计的主要信息来源是血管边缘之间的强度分布。然而，影响强度分布的因素很多：病态，中央光反射和局部照明水平等等。在这项研究中，我们介绍了三个信息来源的宽度估计。这些是由深层网络产生的船舶内部，中心线和边缘位置的概率分布。概率分布图提供对血管几何形状的直接访问，并用于贝叶斯方法的可能性计算，即粒子过滤。我们还引入了一个几何模型，它可以处理概率分布的非理想条件。我们在REVIEW数据集上进行的实验得到了一致的血管宽度估计值，即使在其中一个血管边缘难以识别的情况下。此外，我们的结果表明，这种方法比人类观察者在定位低对比血管的边缘方面更好。
