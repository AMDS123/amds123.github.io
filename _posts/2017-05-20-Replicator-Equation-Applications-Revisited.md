##### Abstract
The replicator equation is a simple model of evolution that leads to stable form of Nash Equilibrium, Evolutionary Stable Strategy (ESS). It has been studied in connection with Evolutionary Game Theory and was originally developed for symmetric games. Beyond its first emphasis in biological use, evolutionary game theory has been expanded well beyond in social studies for behavioral analysis, in machine learning, computer vision and others. Its several applications in the fields of machine learning and computer vision has drawn my attention which is the reason to write this extended abstract

##### Abstract (translated by Google)
复制方程是一个简单的演化模型，导致纳什均衡的稳定形式，演化稳定策略（ESS）。它与进化博弈论有关，最初是为对称博弈而开发的。除了生物学应用的第一个重点之外，进化博弈理论已经扩展到行为分析，机器学习，计算机视觉等领域。它在机器学习和计算机视觉领域的几个应用引起了我的注意，这就是写这个扩展摘要的原因
