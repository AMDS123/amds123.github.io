##### Abstract
GaN nanowire ensembles with axial InGaN multi-quantum wells (MQWs) were grown by molecular beam epitaxy. In a series of samples, we varied the In content in the MQWs from almost zero to about 20%. Within the nanowire ensemble, the MQWs fluctuate strongly in composition and size. Statistical information about the composition was obtained from x-ray diffraction and Raman spectroscopy. Photoluminescence at room temperature was obtained in the range from 2.2 eV to 2.5 eV depending on In content. Contrary to planar MQWs, the intensity increases with increasing In content. We compare the observed emission energies with transition energies obtained from a one-dimensional model, and conclude that several mechanisms for carrier localization affect the luminescence of these three-dimensional structures.
