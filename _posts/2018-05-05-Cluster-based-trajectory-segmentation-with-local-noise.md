##### Abstract
We present a framework for the partitioning of a spatial trajectory in a sequence of segments based on spatial density and temporal criteria. The result is a set of temporally separated clusters interleaved by sub-sequences of unclustered points. A major novelty is the proposal of an outlier or noise model based on the distinction between intra-cluster (local noise) and inter-cluster noise (transition): the local noise models the temporary absence from a residence while the transition the definitive departure towards a next residence. We analyze in detail the properties of the model and present a comprehensive solution for the extraction of temporally ordered clusters. The effectiveness of the solution is evaluated first qualitatively and next quantitatively by contrasting the segmentation with ground truth. The ground truth consists of a set of trajectories of labeled points simulating animal movement. Moreover, we show that the approach can streamline the discovery of additional derived patterns, by presenting a novel technique for the analysis of periodic movement. From a methodological perspective, a valuable aspect of this research is that it combines the theoretical investigation with the application and external validation of the segmentation framework. This paves the way to an effective deployment of the solution in broad and challenging fields such as e-science.

我们提出了一个基于空间密度和时间标准的分段空间轨迹划分框架。结果是一组时间分隔的簇被非聚集点的子序列交织。主要的新颖之处在于基于群内（局部噪声）和群集间噪声（过渡）之间的区别的异常值或噪声模型的建议：当地噪声模拟暂时缺失住宅而过渡到最终偏离朝向下一个住所。我们详细分析了模型的性质，并提出了一个全面的解决方案来提取时间有序的聚类。解决方案的有效性首先定性地评估，然后通过对比分割与地面真相来定量评估。地面真相由一组模拟动物运动的标记点轨迹组成。此外，我们表明该方法可以通过呈现一种用于周期性运动分析的新技术来简化其他派生模式的发现。从方法论的角度来看，本研究的一个有价值的方面是它将理论研究与分割框架的应用和外部验证相结合。这为在电子科学等广泛和具有挑战性的领域有效部署解决方案铺平了道路。
