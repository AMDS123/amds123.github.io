##### Abstract
With regard to a computational representation of literary plot, this paper looks at the use of sentiment analysis for happy ending detection in German novels. Its focus lies on the investigation of previously proposed sentiment features in order to gain insight about the relevance of specific features on the one hand and the implications of their performance on the other hand. Therefore, we study various partitionings of novels, considering the highly variable concept of "ending". We also show that our approach, even though still rather simple, can potentially lead to substantial findings relevant to literary studies.

关于文学情节的计算表示，本文着眼于情感分析在德国小说中的快乐结局检测。其重点在于调查以前提出的情感特征，以便深入了解具体特征与其表现的含义之间的关联性。因此，我们研究了小说的各种划分，考虑到“结局”的高度变化的概念。我们还表明，我们的方法虽然还是相当简单，但可能会导致与文学研究相关的实质性发现。
