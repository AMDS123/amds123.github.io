##### Abstract
A Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) for audio synthesis is trained by augmenting the audio input with information about signal characteristics such as pitch, amplitude, and instrument. The result after training is an audio synthesizer that is played like a musical instrument with the desired musical characteristics provided as continuous parametric control. The focus of this paper is on conditioning data-driven synthesis models with real-valued parameters, and in particular, on the ability of the system a) to generalize and b) to be responsive to parameter values and sequences not seen during training.

##### Abstract (translated by Google)
用于音频合成的递归神经网络（RNN）通过用音调，振幅和乐器等信号特征信息增强音频输入来训练。训练后的结果是一个音乐合成器，它可以像乐器一样播放，并提供连续参数控制所需的音乐特性。本文的重点是调节具有实值参数的数据驱动合成模型，特别是系统a）推广和b）响应训练期间未见的参数值和序列的能力。
