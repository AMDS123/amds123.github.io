##### Abstract
We have successfully produced infrasound, as a duplicate of that produced by Industrial Wind Turbines. We have been able to produce this Infrasound inside a research chamber, capable of accommodating a human test subject. It is our vision that this project will permit others, with appropriate medical training and ethical oversight, to research human thresholds and the effects of this infrasound on humans. Our role has focused on producing the tools, systems, and hardware required, to permit this research to go forward. This paper describes the evolution of our project from the original vision, through the construction of proof of concept prototypes, a series of improved models and their associated accessories /operating systems, to the final test chamber as it stands now ready to deploy. Also included are the mathematical and computational data supporting our claim that infrasound conditions inside the chamber can be made to duplicate those from actual Industrial wind turbines at approved setback distances.

我们已经成功地生产了次声波，与工业风力涡轮机产生的副本相似。我们已经能够在研究室内生产这种次声功能，能够适应人体测试对象。我们的愿景是，这个项目将允许其他人通过适当的医疗培训和道德监督来研究人类的阈值以及这种次声对人类的影响。我们的角色专注于生产所需的工具，系统和硬件，以便进行这项研究。本文描述了我们的项目从最初的愿景演变，通过构建概念验证原型，一系列改进的模型及其相关附件/操作系统，到现在可以部署的最终测试室。还包括支持我们的声明的数学和计算数据，室内的次声条件可以在批准的回程距离上复制来自实际工业风力涡轮机的声音条件。
