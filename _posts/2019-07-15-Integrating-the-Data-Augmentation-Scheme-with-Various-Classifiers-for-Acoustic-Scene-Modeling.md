##### Abstract
This technical report describes the IOA team's submission for TASK1A of DCASE2019 challenge. Our acoustic scene classification (ASC) system adopts a data augmentation scheme employing generative adversary networks. Two major classifiers, 1D deep convolutional neural network integrated with scalogram features and 2D fully convolutional neural network integrated with Mel filter bank features, are deployed in the scheme. Other approaches, such as adversary city adaptation, temporal module based on discrete cosine transform and hybrid architectures, have been developed for further fusion. The results of our experiments indicates that the final fusion systems A-D could achieve an accuracy higher than 85% on the officially provided fold 1 evaluation dataset.
