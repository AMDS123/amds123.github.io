##### Abstract
We present a vision-only model for gaming AI which uses a late integration deep convolutional network architecture trained in a purely supervised imitation learning context. Although state-of-the-art deep learning models for video game tasks generally rely on more complex methods such as deep-Q learning, we show that a supervised model which requires substantially fewer resources and training time can already perform well at human reaction speeds on the N64 classic game Super Smash Bros. We frame our learning task as a 30-class classification problem, and our CNN model achieves 80% top-1 and 95% top-3 validation accuracy. With slight test-time fine-tuning, our model is also competitive during live simulation with the highest-level AI built into the game. We will further show evidence through network visualizations that the network is successfully leveraging temporal information during inference to aid in decision making. Our work demonstrates that supervised CNN models can provide good performance in challenging policy prediction tasks while being significantly simpler and more lightweight than alternatives.

我们提出了一个游戏人工智能的视觉模型，该模型使用在纯监督模仿学习环境中训练的后期集成深度卷积网络架构。尽管用于视频游戏任务的最先进的深度学习模型通常依赖于诸如深度Q学习的更复杂的方法，但是我们表明，需要相当少的资源和训练时间的监督模型已经可以在人类反应速度在N64的经典游戏“超级粉碎兄弟”中，我们将学习任务定义为30级分类问题，我们的CNN模型可以实现80％的顶级1和95％的顶级3验证的准确性。通过轻微的测试时间微调，我们的模型在现场模拟时也具有竞争力，同时内置了最高级别的AI。我们将通过网络可视化进一步展示网络在推理过程中成功利用时间信息来帮助决策。我们的工作表明，有监督的CNN模型可以在挑战政策预测任务时提供良好的性能，同时比替代方案更简单，更轻量。
