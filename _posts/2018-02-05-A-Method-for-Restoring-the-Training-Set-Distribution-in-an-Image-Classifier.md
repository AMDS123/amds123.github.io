##### Abstract
Convolutional Neural Networks are a well-known staple of modern image classification. However, it can be difficult to assess the quality and robustness of such models. Deep models are known to perform well on a given training and estimation set, but can easily be fooled by data that is specifically generated for the purpose. It has been shown that one can produce an artificial example that does not represent the desired class, but activates the network in the desired way. This paper describes a new way of reconstructing a sample from the training set distribution of an image classifier without deep knowledge about the underlying distribution. This enables access to the elements of images that most influence the decision of a convolutional network and to extract meaningful information about the training distribution.

卷积神经网络是现代图像分类的着名主要部分。然而，评估这些模型的质量和稳健性可能是困难的。已知深度模型在给定的训练和估计集合上表现良好，但可以容易地被专门为此目的而生成的数据所迷惑。已经表明，可以产生一个不代表所需类别的人为例子，而是以期望的方式激活网络。本文描述了一种从图像分类器的训练集分布中重构样本的新方法，而对基础分布没有深入的了解。这使得能够访问最能影响卷积网络决策的图像元素，并提取关于训练分布的有意义的信息。
