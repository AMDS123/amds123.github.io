##### Abstract
Color based re-identification methods usually rely on a distance function to measure the similarity between individuals. In this paper we study the behavior of several histogram distance measures in different color spaces. We wonder whether there is a particular histogram distance measure better than others, likewise also, if there is a color space that present better discrimination features. Several experiments are designed and evaluated in several images to obtain measures against various color spaces. We test in several image databases. A measure ranking is generated to calculate the area under the CMC, this area is the indicator used to evaluate which distance measure and color space present the best performance for the considered databases. Also, other parameters such as the image division in horizontal stripes and number of histogram bins, have been studied.

基于颜色的重新识别方法通常依靠距离函数来度量个体之间的相似度。在本文中，我们研究了不同颜色空间中几种直方图距离度量的行为。我们想知道是否有一个特定的直方图距离测量比其他更好，同样，如果有一个色彩空间，提供更好的歧视功能。几个实验的设计和评估在几个图像，以获得对各种色彩空间的措施。我们测试了几个图像数据库。生成度量排名以计算CMC下的面积，该面积是用于评估哪个距离度量和色彩空间对于所考虑的数据库而言表现最佳的指标。此外，还研究了其他参数，例如横条纹图像分割和直方图条数。
