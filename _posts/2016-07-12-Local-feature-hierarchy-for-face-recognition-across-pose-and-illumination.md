##### Abstract
Even though face recognition in frontal view and normal lighting condition works very well, the performance degenerates sharply in extreme conditions. Recently there are many work dealing with pose and illumination problems, respectively. However both the lighting and pose variation will always be encountered at the same time. Accordingly we propose an end-to-end face recognition method to deal with pose and illumination simultaneously based on convolutional networks where the discriminative nonlinear features that are invariant to pose and illumination are extracted. Normally the global structure for images taken in different views is quite diverse. Therefore we propose to use the 1*1 convolutional kernel to extract the local features. Furthermore the parallel multi-stream multi-layer 1*1 convolution network is developed to extract multi-hierarchy features. In the experiments we obtained the average face recognition rate of 96.9% on multiPIE dataset,which improves the state-of-the-art of face recognition across poses and illumination by 7.5%. Especially for profile-wise positions, the average recognition rate of our proposed network is 97.8%, which increases the state-of-the-art recognition rate by 19%.

即使正面视图和正常照明条件下的人脸识别效果很好，但在极端条件下性能会急剧下降。最近有很多工作分别处理姿态和照明问题。然而照明和姿势变化总是会同时遇到。相应地，我们提出了一种基于卷积网络同时处理姿态和光照的端到端人脸识别方法，其中提取了对姿态和光照不变的判别性非线性特征。通常情况下，不同观点的图像的全球结构是多种多样的。因此我们建议使用1 * 1卷积核来提取局部特征。并行多流多层1 * 1卷积网络是为了提取多层次特征而开发的。在实验中，我们获得了multiPIE数据集上96.9％的平均人脸识别率，改善了人脸识别和照度7.5％的最新技术。特别是对于剖面位置，我们提出的网络的平均识别率为97.8％，这使得最新的识别率提高了19％。
