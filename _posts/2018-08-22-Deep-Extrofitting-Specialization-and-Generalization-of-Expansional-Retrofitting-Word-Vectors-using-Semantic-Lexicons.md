##### Abstract
The retrofitting techniques, which inject external resources into word representations, have compensated the weakness of distributed representations in semantic and relational knowledge between words. Implicitly retrofitting word vectors by expansional technique (extrofitting), showed that our method outperforms retrofitting in word similarity task as well as is good at generalization. In this paper, we propose deep extrofitting, which is to stack extrofitting in depth. Furthermore, inspired by learning theory, we combine retrofitting with extrofitting, optimizing the result between specialization and generalization. When experimenting with GloVe, we show that our deep extrofitting not only outperforms the previous methods on most of word similarity task but also requires only synonyms. We also report further analysis on the effect of deep extrofitted word vectors on text classification task, resulting in the improvement on the performances.

将外部资源注入单词表示的改造技术弥补了单词之间语义和关系知识中分布式表示的弱点。通过扩展技术（extrofitting）隐式改造单词向量，表明我们的方法优于单词相似性任务中的改进，并且擅长泛化。在本文中，我们提出深度加工，即深度叠加加工。此外，受学习理论的启发，我们将改造与extrofitting相结合，优化专业化和概括之间的结果。在试验GloVe时，我们表明我们的深度加工不仅在大多数单词相似性任务上优于以前的方法，而且只需要同义词。我们还进一步分析了深度加工词向量对文本分类任务的影响，从而提高了性能。
