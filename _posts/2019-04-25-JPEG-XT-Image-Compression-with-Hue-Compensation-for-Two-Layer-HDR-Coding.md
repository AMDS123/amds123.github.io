##### Abstract
We propose a novel JPEG XT image compression with hue compensation for two-layer HDR coding. LDR images produced from JPEG XT bitstreams have some distortion in hue due to tone mapping operations. In order to suppress the color distortion, we apply a novel hue compensation method based on the maximally saturated colors. Moreover, the bitstreams generated by using the proposed method are fully compatible with the JPEG XT standard. In an experiment, the proposed method is demonstrated not only to produce images with small hue degradation but also to maintain well-mapped luminance, in terms of three kinds of criterion: TMQI, hue value in CIEDE2000, and the maximally saturated color on the constant-hue plane.
