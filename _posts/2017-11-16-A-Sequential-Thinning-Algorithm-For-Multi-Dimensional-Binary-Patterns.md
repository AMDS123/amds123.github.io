##### Abstract
Thinning is the removal of contour pixels/points of connected components in an image to produce their skeleton with retained connectivity and structural properties. The output requirements of a thinning procedure often vary with application. This paper proposes a sequential algorithm that is very easy to understand and modify based on application to perform the thinning of multi-dimensional binary patterns. The algorithm was tested on 2D and 3D patterns and showed very good results. Moreover, comparisons were also made with two of the state-of-the-art methods used for 2D patterns. The results obtained prove the validity of the procedure.

细化是去除图像中连接组件的轮廓像素/点，以保留连通性和结构特性来生成它们的骨架。细化程序的输出要求通常随应用程序而变化。本文提出了一种基于应用很容易理解和修改的顺序算法来执行多维二值模式的细化。该算法在2D和3D模式下进行测试，并显示出非常好的结果。此外，还与用于2D模式的两种最先进的方法进行比较。所获得的结果证明了该程序的有效性。
