##### Abstract
In recent years, dynamic vision sensors (DVS), also known as event-based cameras or neuromorphic sensors, have seen increased use due to various advantages over conventional frame-based cameras. Using principles inspired by the retina, its high temporal resolution overcomes motion blurring, its high dynamic range overcomes extreme illumination conditions and its low power consumption makes it ideal for embedded systems on platforms such as drones and self-driving cars. However, event-based data sets are scarce and labels are even rarer for tasks such as object detection. We transferred discriminative knowledge from a state-of-the-art frame-based convolutional neural network (CNN) to the event-based modality via intermediate pseudo-labels, which are used as targets for supervised learning. We show, for the first time, event-based car detection under ego-motion in a real environment at 100 frames per second with a test average precision of 40.3% relative to our annotated ground truth. The event-based car detector handles motion blur and poor illumination conditions despite not explicitly trained to do so, and even complements frame-based CNN detectors, suggesting that it has learnt generalized visual representations.
