##### Abstract
Accurately predicting and inferring a driver's decision to brake is critical for designing warning systems and avoiding collisions. In this paper we focus on predicting a driver's intent to brake in car-following scenarios from a perception-decision-action perspective according to his/her driving history. A learning-based inference method, using onboard data from CAN-Bus, radar and cameras as explanatory variables, is introduced to infer drivers' braking decisions by combining a Gaussian mixture model (GMM) with a hidden Markov model (HMM). The GMM is used to model stochastic relationships among variables, while the HMM is applied to infer drivers' braking actions based on the GMM. Real-case driving data from 49 drivers (more than three years' driving data per driver on average) have been collected from the University of Michigan Safety Pilot Model Deployment database. We compare the GMM-HMM method to a support vector machine (SVM) method and an SVM-Bayesian filtering method. The experimental results are evaluated by employing three performance metrics: accuracy, sensitivity, specificity. The comparison results show that the GMM-HMM obtains the best performance, with an accuracy of 90%, sensitivity of 84%, and specificity of 97%. Thus, we believe that this method has great potential for real-world active safety systems.

准确预测和推断驾驶员的制动决定对设计警告系统和避免碰撞至关重要。在本文中，我们着重于根据驾驶历史，从感知决策行动的角度来预测驾驶员在车辆跟随情景中的制动意图。通过将高斯混合模型（GMM）与隐马尔可夫模型（HMM）相结合，引入基于学习的推理方法，使用来自CAN总线的车载数据，雷达和相机作为解释变量来推断驾驶员的制动决策。 GMM被用来模拟变量之间的随机关系，而HMM则被用来基于GMM来推断驾驶员的制动行为。已经从密歇根大学安全驾驶员模型部署数据库收集了来自49名驾驶员的实际驾驶数据（平均每名驾驶员三年以上驾驶数据）。我们将GMM-HMM方法与支持向量机（SVM）方法和SVM-贝叶斯过滤方法进行比较。实验结果通过采用三个性能指标进行评估：准确性，灵敏度，特异性。对比结果表明，GMM-HMM的性能最好，精度为90％，灵敏度为84％，特异性为97％。因此，我们认为这种方法对于现实的主动安全系统具有很大的潜力。
