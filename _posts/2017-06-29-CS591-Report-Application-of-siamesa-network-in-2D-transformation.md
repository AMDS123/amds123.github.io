##### Abstract
Deep learning has been extensively used various aspects of computer vision area. Deep learning separate itself from traditional neural network by having a much deeper and complicated network layers in its network structures. Traditionally, deep neural network is abundantly used in computer vision tasks including classification and detection and has achieve remarkable success and set up a new state of the art results in these fields. Instead of using neural network for vision recognition and detection. I will show the ability of neural network to do image registration, synthesis of images and image retrieval in this report.

##### Abstract (translated by Google)
深度学习被广泛应用于计算机视觉领域的各个方面。深度学习通过在其网络结构中具有更深和更复杂的网络层，从传统的神经网络中分离出来。传统上，深度神经网络被广泛用于包括分类和检测在内的计算机视觉任务，取得了显着的成功，并在这些领域创造了一个新的成果。而不是使用神经网络进行视觉识别和检测。我将展示神经网络在本报告中进行图像配准，图像合成和图像检索的能力。
