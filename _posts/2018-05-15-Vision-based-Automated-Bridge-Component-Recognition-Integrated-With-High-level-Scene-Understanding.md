##### Abstract
Image data has a great potential of helping conventional visual inspections of civil engineering structures due to the ease of data acquisition and the advantages in capturing visual information. A variety of techniques have been proposed to detect damages, such as cracks and spalling on a close-up image of a single component (columns and road surfaces etc.). However, these techniques commonly suffer from severe false-positives especially when the image includes multiple components of different structures. To reduce the false-positives and extract reliable information about the structures' conditions, detection and localization of critical structural components are important first steps preceding the damage assessment. This study aims at recognizing bridge structural and non-structural components from images of urban scenes. During the bridge component recognition, every image pixel is classified into one of the five classes (non-bridge, columns, beams and slabs, other structural, other nonstructural) by multi-scale convolutional neural networks (multi-scale CNNs). To reduce false-positives and get consistent labels, the component classifications are integrated with scene understanding by an additional classifier with 10 higher-level scene classes (building, greenery, person, pavement, signs and poles, vehicles, bridges, water, sky, and others). The bridge component recognition integrated with the scene understanding is compared with the naive approach without scene classification in terms of accuracy, false-positives and consistencies to demonstrate the effectiveness of the integrated approach.

由于数据采集的简便性和捕获视觉信息的优势，图像数据有助于对土木工程结构进行常规视觉检查。已经提出了各种技术来检测损坏，例如单个部件（柱和路面等）的特写图像上的裂缝和剥落。但是，这些技术通常会遭受严重的假阳性，特别是当图像包含多个不同结构的组件时。为了减少误报并提取关于结构状况的可靠信息，关键结构构件的检测和定位是损伤评估之前的重要第一步。这项研究旨在从城市场景图像中识别桥梁结构和非结构组件。在桥梁构件识别过程中，通过多尺度卷积神经网络（多尺度CNN）将每个图像像素划分为五类中的一类（非桥梁，柱，梁和板，其他结构，其他非结构）。为了减少误报并获得一致的标签，组件分类与场景理解相结合，通过额外的分类器与10个更高级别的场景类别（建筑，绿化，人员，路面，标志和杆，车辆，桥梁，水，天空，和别的）。与场景理解相结合的桥梁构件识别与没有场景分类的朴素方法在准确性，假阳性和一致性方面进行了比较，以证明综合方法的有效性。
