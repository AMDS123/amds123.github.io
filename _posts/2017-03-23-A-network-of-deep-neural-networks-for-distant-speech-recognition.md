##### Abstract
Despite the remarkable progress recently made in distant speech recognition, state-of-the-art technology still suffers from a lack of robustness, especially when adverse acoustic conditions characterized by non-stationary noises and reverberation are met. A prominent limitation of current systems lies in the lack of matching and communication between the various technologies involved in the distant speech recognition process. The speech enhancement and speech recognition modules are, for instance, often trained independently. Moreover, the speech enhancement normally helps the speech recognizer, but the output of the latter is not commonly used, in turn, to improve the speech enhancement. To address both concerns, we propose a novel architecture based on a network of deep neural networks, where all the components are jointly trained and better cooperate with each other thanks to a full communication scheme between them. Experiments, conducted using different datasets, tasks and acoustic conditions, revealed that the proposed framework can overtake other competitive solutions, including recent joint training approaches.

尽管最近在远距离语音识别方面取得了令人瞩目的进展，但是最先进的技术仍然缺乏稳定性，尤其是在满足以非平稳噪声和混响为特征的不利声学条件时。目前系统的一个显着局限在于远程语音识别过程中所涉及的各种技术之间缺乏匹配和通信。例如，语音增强和语音识别模块经常是独立训练的。此外，语音增强通常有助于语音识别器，但后者的输出不常用，从而改善语音增强。为了解决这两个问题，我们提出了一个基于深度神经网络的新型架构，其中所有的组件都是联合训练的，并且由于它们之间的全面通信方案而更好地彼此协作。使用不同的数据集，任务和声学条件进行的实验表明，所提出的框架可以超越其他竞争性解决方案，包括最近的联合训练方法。
