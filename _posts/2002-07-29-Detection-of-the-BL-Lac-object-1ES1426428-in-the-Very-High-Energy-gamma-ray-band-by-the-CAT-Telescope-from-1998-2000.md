##### Abstract
The BL Lac Object 1ES 1426+428, at a red-shift of z=0.129, has been monitored by the CAT telescope from February 1998 to June 2000. The accumulation of 26 hours of observations shows a gamma-ray signal of 321 events above 250 GeV at 5.2 standard deviations, determined using data analysis cuts adapted to a weak, steep-spectrum source. The source emission has an average flux of Phi_diff(400 GeV) = 6.73 +/- 1.27stat +/- 1.45syst x 10^-11 /cm^-2/s/TeV, and a very steep spectrum, with a differential spectral index of gamma = -3.60 +/- 0.57 which can be refined to gamma = -3.66 +/- 0.41 using a higher flux data subset. If, as expected from its broad-band properties, the Very High Energy emission is hard at the source, these observations support a strong absorption effect of gamma-rays by the Intergalactic Infrared field.
