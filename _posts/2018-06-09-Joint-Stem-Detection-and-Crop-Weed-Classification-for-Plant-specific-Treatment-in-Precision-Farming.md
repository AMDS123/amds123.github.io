##### Abstract
Applying agrochemicals is the default procedure for conventional weed control in crop production, but has negative impacts on the environment. Robots have the potential to treat every plant in the field individually and thus can reduce the required use of such chemicals. To achieve that, robots need the ability to identify crops and weeds in the field and must additionally select effective treatments. While certain types of weed can be treated mechanically, other types need to be treated by (selective) spraying. In this paper, we present an approach that provides the necessary information for effective plant-specific treatment. It outputs the stem location for weeds, which allows for mechanical treatments, and the covered area of the weed for selective spraying. Our approach uses an end-to-end trainable fully convolutional network that simultaneously estimates stem positions as well as the covered area of crops and weeds. It jointly learns the class-wise stem detection and the pixel-wise semantic segmentation. Experimental evaluations on different real-world datasets show that our approach is able to reliably solve this problem. Compared to state-of-the-art approaches, our approach not only substantially improves the stem detection accuracy, i.e., distinguishing crop and weed stems, but also provides an improvement in the semantic segmentation performance.

施用农用化学品是农作物生产中常规除草的默认程序，但对环境有负面影响。机器人有可能单独处理该领域的每个工厂，因此可以减少这些化学品的使用需求。要做到这一点，机器人需要能够识别田间作物和杂草，并且必须另外选择有效的处理方法。虽然某些类型的杂草可以机械处理，但其他类型需要通过（选择性）喷洒进行处理。在本文中，我们提供了一种方法，为有效的植物特定处理提供必要的信息。它输出茎的杂草地点，可以进行机械处理，以及杂草的覆盖区域进行选择性喷洒。我们的方法使用端到端可训练全卷积网络，可同时估计茎位以及作物和杂草的覆盖面积。它共同学习了基于分类的词干检测和基于像素的语义分词。对不同实际数据集的实验评估表明，我们的方法能够可靠地解决这个问题。与最先进的方法相比，我们的方法不仅大大提高了茎检测的准确性，即区分作物和杂草茎，而且提高了语义分割性能。
