##### Abstract
Optoacoustic (photoacoustic) tomography is aimed at reconstructing maps of the initial pressure rise induced by the absorption of light pulses in tissue. In practice, due to inaccurate assumptions in the forward model, noise and other experimental factors, the images are often afflicted by artifacts, occasionally manifested as negative values. We present a novel method for optoacoustic tomography based on an entropy maximization algorithm, which uses logarithmic regularization for attaining non-negative reconstructions. We report the performance achieved by the entropy maximization scheme on numerical simulation, experimental phantoms and in-vivo samples. The findings demonstrate that the proposed scheme reconstructs physically relevant image values devoid of unwanted negative contrast, thus improving quantitative imaging performance.
