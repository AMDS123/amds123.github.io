##### Abstract
The Ord's graph is a simple graphical method for displaying frequency distributions of data or theoretical distributions in the two-dimensional plane. Its coordinates are proportions of the first three moments, either empirical or theoretical ones. A modification of the Ord's graph based on proportions of indices of qualitative variation is presented. Such a modification makes the graph applicable also to data of categorical character. In addition, the indices are normalized with values between 0 and 1, which enables comparing data files divided into different numbers of categories. Both the original and the new graph are used to display grapheme frequencies in eleven Slavic languages. As the original Ord's graph requires an assignment of numbers to the categories, graphemes were ordered decreasingly according to their frequencies. Data were taken from parallel corpora, i.e., we work with grapheme frequencies from a Russian novel and its translations to ten other Slavic languages. Then, cluster analysis is applied to the graph coordinates. While the original graph yields results which are not linguistically interpretable, the modification reveals meaningful relations among the languages.

##### Abstract (translated by Google)
Ord图是一种简单的图形方法，用于显示二维平面中的数据或理论分布的频率分布。它的坐标是前三个时刻的比例，无论是经验还是理论。给出了基于质量变异指标比例的Ord图的修正。这种修改使图形也适用于分类字符的数据。另外，这些索引用0和1之间的值标准化，这使比较数据文件分成不同数量的类别。原始图和新图均用于以十一种斯拉夫语言显示字形频率。由于原始的Ord图需要对类别进行数字分配，所以字素按其频率递减排序。数据是从平行的语料库中得到的，也就是说，我们使用俄语小说的字形频率，并翻译成其他十种斯拉夫语言。然后，将聚类分析应用于图坐标。虽然原始图形产生的结果不是语言上可解释的，但修改揭示了语言之间的有意义的关系。
