##### Abstract
The design of neural network architectures for a new data set is a laborious task which requires human deep learning expertise. In order to make deep learning available for a broader audience, automated methods for finding a neural network architecture are vital. Recently proposed methods can already achieve human expert level performances. However, these methods have run times of months or even years of GPU computing time, ignoring hardware constraints as faced by many researchers and companies. We propose the use of Monte Carlo planning in combination with two different UCT (upper confidence bound applied to trees) derivations to search for network architectures. We adapt the UCT algorithm to the needs of network architecture search by proposing two ways of sharing information between different branches of the search tree. In an empirical study we are able to demonstrate that this method is able to find competitive networks for MNIST, SVHN and CIFAR-10 in just a single GPU day. Extending the search time to five GPU days, we are able to outperform human architectures and our competitors which consider the same types of layers.

一个新的数据集的神经网络架构的设计是一项艰巨的任务，这需要人类的深度学习的专业知识。为了让更广泛的受众获得深入的学习，寻找神经网络体系结构的自动化方法至关重要。最近提出的方法已经可以达到人类专家级的性能。然而，这些方法的运行时间是几个月甚至几年的GPU计算时间，忽略了许多研究人员和公司面临的硬件限制。我们提出使用蒙特卡罗规划结合两种不同的UCT（应用于树的上置信限）派生搜索网络架构。通过提出两种在搜索树的不同分支之间共享信息的方式，使UCT算法适应网络结构搜索的需要。在一个实证研究中，我们能够证明这种方法能够在单一GPU日找到MNIST，SVHN和CIFAR-10的竞争网络。将搜索时间延长到五个GPU天，我们能够胜过考虑相同类型的层的人类体系结构和我们的竞争者。
