##### Abstract
We report single-photon emission from electrically driven site-controlled InGaN/GaN quantum dots, fabricated from a planar light-emitting diode structure containing a single InGaN quantum well using a top-down approach. The location, dimension, and height of each single-photon-emitting diode are controlled lithographically, providing great flexibility for chip-scale integration.
