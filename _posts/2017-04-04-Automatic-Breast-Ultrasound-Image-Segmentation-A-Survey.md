##### Abstract
Breast cancer is one of the leading causes of cancer death among women worldwide. In clinical routine, automatic breast ultrasound (BUS) image segmentation is very challenging and essential for cancer diagnosis and treatment planning. Many BUS segmentation approaches have been studied in the last two decades, and have been proved to be effective on private datasets. Currently, the advancement of BUS image segmentation seems to meet its bottleneck. The improvement of the performance is increasingly challenging, and only few new approaches were published in the last several years. It is the time to look at the field by reviewing previous approaches comprehensively and to investigate the future directions. In this paper, we study the basic ideas, theories, pros and cons of the approaches, group them into categories, and extensively review each category in depth by discussing the principles, application issues, and advantages/disadvantages.

##### Abstract (translated by Google)
乳腺癌是全球女性癌症死亡的主要原因之一。在临床常规中，自动乳房超声（BUS）图像分割对于癌症诊断和治疗计划是非常具有挑战性的和必不可少的。许多BUS分割方法在过去的二十年中已经被研究，并且已经被证明在私人数据集上是有效的。目前，BUS图像分割的进步似乎也遇到了瓶颈。绩效的提高越来越具有挑战性，过去几年里只有少数新的方法被发表。现在是全面回顾以前的方法来看现场的时候，并且调查未来的方向。本文研究方法的基本思想，理论，优缺点，将其分为几类，通过讨论各种方法的原理，应用问题和优缺点，对各类进行深入的研究。
