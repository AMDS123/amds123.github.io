##### Abstract
Brain tumor is considered as one of the deadliest and most common form of cancer both in children and in adults. Consequently, determining the correct type of brain tumor in early stages is of significant importance to devise a precise treatment plan and predict patient's response to the adopted treatment. In this regard, there has been a recent surge of interest in designing Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for the problem of brain tumor type classification. However, CNNs typically require large amount of training data and can not properly handle input transformations. Capsule networks (referred to as CapsNets) are brand new machine learning architectures proposed very recently to overcome these shortcomings of CNNs, and posed to revolutionize deep learning solutions. Of particular interest to this work is that Capsule networks are robust to rotation and affine transformation, and require far less training data, which is the case for processing medical image datasets including brain Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) images. In this paper, we focus to achieve the following four objectives: (i) Adopt and incorporate CapsNets for the problem of brain tumor classification to design an improved architecture which maximizes the accuracy of the classification problem at hand; (ii) Investigate the over-fitting problem of CapsNets based on a real set of MRI images; (iii) Explore weather or not CapsNets are capable of providing better fit for the whole brain images or just the segmented tumor, and; (iv) Develop a visualization paradigm for the output of the CapsNet to better explain the learned features. Our results show that the proposed approach can successfully overcome CNNs for the brain tumor classification problem.

脑肿瘤被认为是儿童和成人中最致命和最常见的癌症之一。因此，在早期确定正确的脑肿瘤类型对于制定精确治疗计划和预测患者对所采用治疗的反应具有重要意义。在这方面，最近人们对设计用于脑肿瘤类型分类问题的卷积神经网络（CNN）感兴趣。然而，CNN通常需要大量的训练数据，并且无法正确处理输入变换。胶囊网络（简称CapsNets）是最近提出的全新机器学习体系结构，旨在克服CNN的这些缺点，并为深度学习解决方案带来革命性变革。这项工作特别感兴趣的是Capsule网络对于旋转和仿射变换是强健的，并且需要少得多的训练数据，这是处理包括脑部磁共振成像（MRI）图像的医学图像数据集的情况。在本文中，我们着重实现以下四个目标：（i）采用并纳入CapsNets来解决脑肿瘤分类问题，以设计一种改进的体系结构，以最大限度地提高分类问题的准确性; （ii）根据真实的MRI图像调查CapsNet的过度拟合问题; （iii）探索天气CapsNets能够更好地适应整个大脑图像或仅分割肿瘤，并且; （iv）为CapsNet的输出开发可视化范例，以更好地解释学习到的功能。我们的研究结果表明，所提出的方法可以成功克服脑肿瘤分类问题的CNNs。
