##### Abstract
This paper focuses on improving face recognition performance with a new signature combining implicit facial features with explicit soft facial attributes. This signature has two components: the existing patch-based features and the soft facial attributes. A deep convolutional neural network adapted from state-of-the-art networks is used to learn the soft facial attributes. Then, a signature matcher is introduced that merges the contributions of both patch-based features and the facial attributes. In this matcher, the matching scores computed from patch-based features and the facial attributes are combined to obtain a final matching score. The matcher is also extended so that different weights are assigned to different facial attributes. The proposed signature and matcher have been evaluated with the UR2D system on the UHDB31 and IJB-A datasets. The experimental results indicate that the proposed signature achieve better performance than using only patch-based features. The Rank-1 accuracy is improved significantly by 4% and 0.37% on the two datasets when compared with the UR2D system.

本文着重于改进人脸识别性能，结合隐式人脸特征和明确软面部属性的新签名。此签名包含两个组件：现有的基于修补程序的功能和软面部属性。使用由最先进的网络改编的深卷积神经网络来学习软面部属性。然后，引入签名匹配器，合并基于补丁的特征和面部属性的贡献。在这个匹配器中，从基于补丁的特征和面部属性计算出的匹配分数被组合以获得最终的匹配分数。匹配器也被扩展，以便将不同的权重分配给不同的面部属性。所提出的签名和匹配器已经通过UHDB31和IJB-A数据集上的UR2D系统进行了评估。实验结果表明，所提出的签名比仅使用基于补丁的特征获得更好的性能。与UR2D系统相比，两个数据集的秩-1准确性显着提高4％和0.37％。
