##### Abstract
Interestingness,as the composition of Relevance and Unexpectedness, has been tested by means of Web search cases studies and led to promising results. But for thorough investigation and routine practical application one needs a flexible and robust tool. This work describes such an Interestingness based search tool, its software architecture and actual implementation. One of its flexibility traits is the choice of Interestingness functions: it may work with Match-Mismatch and Tf-Idf, among other functions. The tool has been experimentally verified by application to various domains of interest. It has been validated by comparison of results with those of commercial search engines and results from differing Interestingness functions.
