##### Abstract
Chinese word usage errors often occur in non-native Chinese learners' writing. It is very helpful for non-native Chinese learners to detect them automatically when learning writing. In this paper, we propose a novel approach, which takes advantages of different auxiliary tasks, such as POS-tagging prediction and word log frequency prediction, to help the task of Chinese word usage error detection. With the help of these auxiliary tasks, we achieve the state-of-the-art results on the performances on the HSK corpus data, without any other extra data.
