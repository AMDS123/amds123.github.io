##### Abstract
Physical fluents, a term originally used by Newton [40], refers to time-varying object states in dynamic scenes. In this paper, we are interested in inferring the fluents of vehicles from video. For example, a door (hood, trunk) is open or closed through various actions, light is blinking to turn. Recognizing these fluents has broad applications, yet have received scant attention in the computer vision literature. Car fluent recognition entails a unified framework for car detection, car part localization and part status recognition, which is made difficult by large structural and appearance variations, low resolutions and occlusions. This paper learns a spatial-temporal And-Or hierarchical model to represent car fluents. The learning of this model is formulated under the latent structural SVM framework. Since there are no publicly related dataset, we collect and annotate a car fluent dataset consisting of car videos with diverse fluents. In experiments, the proposed method outperforms several highly related baseline methods in terms of car fluent recognition and car part localization.

物理流体，牛顿最初使用的一个术语[40]，是指在动态场景中随时间变化的物体状态。在本文中，我们有兴趣从视频推断车辆的废气。例如，一个门（引擎盖，后备箱）通过各种动作打开或关闭，灯闪烁转动。认识到这些流程有广泛的应用，但在计算机视觉文献中却很少受到关注。汽车流畅的识别需要一个统一的汽车检测，汽车零件定位和零件状态识别的框架，由于结构和外观的变化大，分辨率低，遮挡等原因，难以实现。本文学习了一个时空的And-Or分层模型来表示汽车尾气。该模型的学习是在潜在的结构SVM框架下进行的。由于没有公开相关的数据集，我们收集并注释了由含有不同流路的汽车视频组成的车载流利数据集。在实验中，所提出的方法在汽车流畅识别和汽车部件定位方面优于几种高度相关的基线方法。
