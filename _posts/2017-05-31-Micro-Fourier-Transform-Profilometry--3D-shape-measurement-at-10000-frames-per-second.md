##### Abstract
Recent advances in imaging sensors and digital light projection technology have facilitated a rapid progress in 3D optical sensing, enabling 3D surfaces of complex-shaped objects to be captured with improved resolution and accuracy. However, due to the large number of projection patterns required for phase recovery and disambiguation, the maximum fame rates of current 3D shape measurement techniques are still limited to the range of hundreds of frames per second (fps). Here, we demonstrate a new 3D dynamic imaging technique, Micro Fourier Transform Profilometry ($\mu$FTP), which can capture 3D surfaces of transient events at up to 10,000 fps based on our newly developed high-speed fringe projection system. Compared with existing techniques, $\mu$FTP has the prominent advantage of recovering an accurate, unambiguous, and dense 3D point cloud with only two projected patterns. Furthermore, the phase information is encoded within a single high-frequency fringe image, thereby allowing motion-artifact-free reconstruction of transient events with temporal resolution of 50 microseconds. To show $\mu$FTP's broad utility, we use it to reconstruct 3D videos of 4 transient scenes: vibrating cantilevers, rotating fan blades, bullet fired from a toy gun, and balloon's explosion triggered by a flying dart, which were previously difficult or even unable to be captured with conventional approaches.

成像传感器和数字光投影技术的最新进展促进了3D光学传感的快速发展，使复杂形状物体的3D表面能够以更高的分辨率和准确度被捕获。然而，由于相位恢复和消歧所需的大量投影图案，当前3D形状测量技术的最大成像率仍然被限制在每秒数百帧（fps）的范围内。在这里，我们展示了一种新的三维动态成像技术，即基于我们新开发的高速条纹投影系统，能够以高达10,000 fps的速度捕捉瞬态事件的三维表面的微型傅里叶变换轮廓术（$ \ mu $ FTP）。与现有技术相比，$ \ mu $ FTP具有恢复精确，明确，密集的三维点云的突出优势，只有两种投影模式。此外，相位信息被编码在单个高频条纹图像中，从而允许具有50微秒的时间分辨率的瞬态事件的无运动伪像重建。为了显示$ \ mu $ FTP的广泛用途，我们使用它来重建4个瞬态场景的3D视频：振动悬臂，旋转风扇叶片，玩具枪发射的子弹，以及飞镖触发的气球爆炸甚至无法用传统的方法来捕捉。
