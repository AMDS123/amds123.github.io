##### Abstract
UV Raman scattering studies show longitudinal optical (LO) mode up to 4th order in wurtzite GaN nanowire system. Frohlich interaction of electron with the long range electrostatic field of ionic bonded GaN gives rise to enhancement in LO phonon modes. Good crystalline quality, as indicated by the crystallographic as well as luminescence studies, is thought to be responsible for this significant observation. Calculated size dependence, incorporating size corrected dielectric constants, of electron-phonon interaction energy agrees well with measured values and also predict stronger interaction energy than that of the bulk for diameter below ~3 nm.
