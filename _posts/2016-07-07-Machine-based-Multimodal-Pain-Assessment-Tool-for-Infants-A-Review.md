##### Abstract
The current practice of assessing infants' pain depends on using subjective tools that fail to meet rigorous psychometric standards and requires continuous monitoring by health professionals. Therefore, pain may be misinterpreted or totally missed leading to misdiagnosis and over/under treatment. To address these shortcomings, the current practice can be augmented with a machine-based assessment tool that continuously monitors various pain cues and provides a consistent and minimally biased evaluation of pain. Several machine-based approaches have been proposed to assess infants' pain based on analysis of whether behavioral or physiological pain indictors (i.e., single modality). The aim of this review paper is to provide the reader with the current machine-based approaches in assessing infants' pain. It also proposes the development of a multimodal machine-based pain assessment tool and presents preliminary implementation results.

##### Abstract (translated by Google)
目前评估婴儿疼痛的做法取决于使用不符合严格的心理测量标准的主观工具，并需要卫生专业人员的持续监测。因此，疼痛可能会被误解或完全漏诊，从而导致误诊和过度治疗。为了解决这些缺点，目前的做法可以通过一个基于机器的评估工具进行扩展，该工具可持续监测各种疼痛信号，并提供一致且最低限度的疼痛评估。已经提出了几种基于机器的方法来基于对行为或生理疼痛指标（即单一形式）的分析来评估婴儿的疼痛。这篇评论文章的目的是为读者提供评估婴儿疼痛的当前机器方法。它还提出了一种多模式机器疼痛评估工具的开发，并提出初步实施结果。
