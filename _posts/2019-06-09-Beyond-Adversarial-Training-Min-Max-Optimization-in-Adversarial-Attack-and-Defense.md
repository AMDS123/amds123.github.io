##### Abstract
The worst-case training principle that minimizes the maximal adversarial loss, also known as adversarial training (AT), has shown to be a state-of-the-art approach for enhancing adversarial robustness against norm-ball bounded input perturbations. Nonetheless, min-max optimization beyond the purpose of AT has not been rigorously explored in the research of adversarial attack and defense. In particular, given a set of risk sources (domains), minimizing the maximal loss induced from the domain set can be reformulated as a general min-max problem that is different from AT, since the maximization is taken over the probability simplex of the domain set. Examples of this general formulation include attacking model ensembles, devising universal perturbation to input samples or data transformations, and generalized AT over multiple norm-ball threat models. We show that these problems can be solved under a unified and theoretically principled min-max optimization framework. Our proposed approach leads to substantial performance improvement over the uniform averaging strategy in four different tasks. Moreover, we show how the self-adjusted weighting factors of the probability simplex from our proposed algorithms can be used to explain the importance of different attack and defense models.
