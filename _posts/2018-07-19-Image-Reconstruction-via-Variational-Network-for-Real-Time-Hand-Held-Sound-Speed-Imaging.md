##### Abstract
Speed-of-sound is a biomechanical property for quantitative tissue differentiation, with great potential as a new ultrasound-based image modality. A conventional ultrasound array transducer can be used together with an acoustic mirror, or so-called reflector, to reconstruct sound-speed images from time-of-flight measurements to the reflector collected between transducer element pairs, which constitutes a challenging problem of limited-angle computed tomography. For this problem, we herein present a variational network based image reconstruction architecture that is based on optimization loop unrolling, and provide an efficient training protocol of this network architecture on fully synthetic inclusion data. Our results indicate that the learned model presents good generalization ability, being able to reconstruct images with significantly different statistics compared to the training set. Complex inclusion geometries were shown to be successfully reconstructed, also improving over the prior-art by 23% in reconstruction error and by 10% in contrast on synthetic data. In a phantom study, we demonstrated the detection of multiple inclusions that were not distinguishable by prior-art reconstruction, meanwhile improving the contrast by 27% for a stiff inclusion and by 219% for a soft inclusion. Our reconstruction algorithm takes approximately 10ms, enabling its use as a real-time imaging method on an ultrasound machine, for which we are demonstrating an example preliminary setup herein.

声速是用于定量组织分化的生物力学特性，作为基于超声的新图像模态具有巨大潜力。传统的超声阵列换能器可以与声学镜或所谓的反射器一起使用，以重建从飞行时间测量到收集在换能器元件对之间的反射器的声速图像，这构成了受限制的挑战性问题 - 角度计算机断层扫描。针对该问题，本文提出了一种基于变分循环展开的基于变分网络的图像重建体系结构，并在全合成包含数据上提供该网络体系结构的有效训练协议。我们的结果表明，学习模型具有良好的泛化能力，能够重建与训练集相比具有显着不同统计的图像。复杂的包含几何形状被证明可以成功地重建，相对于现有技术，在重建误差方面也提高了23％，在合成数据方面也提高了10％。在一项幻像研究中，我们证明了现有技术重建无法区分的多个夹杂物的检测，同时将刚性夹杂物的对比度提高了27％，柔软夹杂物的对比度提高了219％。我们的重建算法大约需要10毫秒，因此可以在超声波机器上用作实时成像方法，我们在此展示了一个示例初步设置。
