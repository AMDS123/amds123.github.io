##### Abstract
Single-pixel cameras based on the concepts of compressed sensing (CS) leverage the inherent structure of images to retrieve them with far fewer measurements and operate efficiently over a significantly broader spectral range than conventional silicon-based cameras. Recently, photonic time-stretch (PTS) technique facilitates the emergence of high-speed single-pixel cameras. A significant breakthrough in imaging speed of single-pixel cameras enables observation of fast dynamic phenomena. However, according to CS theory, image reconstruction is an iterative process that consumes enormous amounts of computational time and cannot be performed in real time. To address this challenge, we propose a novel single-pixel imaging technique that can produce high-quality images through rapid acquisition of their effective spatial Fourier spectrum. We employ phase-shifting sinusoidal structured illumination instead of random illumination for spectrum acquisition and apply inverse Fourier transform to the obtained spectrum for image restoration. We evaluate the performance of our prototype system by recognizing quick response (QR) codes and flow cytometric screening of cells. A frame rate of 625 kHz and a compression ratio of 10% are experimentally demonstrated in accordance with the recognition rate of the QR code. An imaging flow cytometer enabling high-content screening with an unprecedented throughput of 100,000 cells/s is also demonstrated. For real-time imaging applications, the proposed single-pixel microscope can significantly reduce the time required for image reconstruction by two orders of magnitude, which can be widely applied in industrial quality control and label-free biomedical imaging.

基于压缩感应（CS）概念的单像素相机利用图像的固有结构，以比传统硅基相机更少的测量结果进行检索，并在更宽的光谱范围内有效运行。最近，光子时间拉伸（PTS）技术促进了高速单像素相机的出现。单像素相机的成像速度的重大突破使得能够观察到快速的动态现象。然而，根据CS理论，图像重建是一个迭代过程，耗费大量的计算时间，不能实时执行。为了解决这个挑战，我们提出了一种新颖的单像素成像技术，可以通过快速获取有效的空间傅里叶光谱来产生高质量的图像。我们采用相移正弦结构照明代替随机照射进行光谱采集，并对获得的光谱应用傅里叶逆变换进行图像恢复。我们通过识别细胞的快速响应（QR）代码和流式细胞筛选来评估我们的原型系统的性能。根据QR码的识别率，以625kHz的帧速率和10％的压缩率进行实验演示。还展示了能够以100,000个细胞/秒的空前吞吐量实现高内容筛选的成像流式细胞仪。对于实时成像应用，所提出的单像素显微镜可以将图像重建所需的时间显着减少两个数量级，可以广泛应用于工业质量控制和无标记生物医学成像。
