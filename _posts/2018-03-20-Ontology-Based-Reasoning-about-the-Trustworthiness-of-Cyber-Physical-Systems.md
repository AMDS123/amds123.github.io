##### Abstract
It has been challenging for the technical and regulatory communities to formulate requirements for trustworthiness of the cyber-physical systems (CPS) due to the complexity of the issues associated with their design, deployment, and operations. The US National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), through a public working group, has released a CPS Framework that adopts a broad and integrated view of CPS and positions trustworthiness among other aspects of CPS. This paper takes the model created by the CPS Framework and its further developments one step further, by applying ontological approaches and reasoning techniques in order to achieve greater understanding of CPS. The example analyzed in the paper demonstrates the enrichment of the original CPS model obtained through ontology and reasoning and its ability to deliver additional insights to the developers and operators of CPS.

##### Abstract (translated by Google)
由于与设计，部署和操作相关的问题的复杂性，技术和监管机构制定网络物理系统（CPS）的可信性要求一直是一个挑战。美国国家标准与技术研究院（NIST）通过一个公共工作组发布了一个CPS框架，该框架采用了CPS的广泛和综合的观点，并在CPS的其他方面确立了可信度。本文采用CPS框架创建的模型及其进一步发展，应用本体论方法和推理技术，以便更好地理解CPS。本文分析的例子证明了通过本体论和推理获得的原始CPS模型的丰富性，以及为CPS的开发者和运营者提供更多见解的能力。
