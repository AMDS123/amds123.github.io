##### Abstract
We propose a variational approach to obtain super-resolution images from multiple low-resolution frames extracted from video clips. First the displacement between the low-resolution frames and the reference frame are computed by an optical flow algorithm. Then a low-rank model is used to construct the reference frame in high-resolution by incorporating the information of the low-resolution frames. The model has two terms: a 2-norm data fidelity term and a nuclear-norm regularization term. Alternating direction method of multipliers is used to solve the model. Comparison of our methods with other models on synthetic and real video clips show that our resulting images are more accurate with less artifacts. It also provides much finer and discernable details.

我们提出了一种变化的方法来从视频剪辑中提取多个低分辨率的帧获得超分辨率的图像。首先，通过光流算法计算低分辨率帧和参考帧之间的位移。然后通过引入低分辨率帧的信息，采用低秩模型构建高分辨率的参考帧。该模型有两个术语：一个2-范数据保真度项和一个核范数正则化项。用乘法器的交替方向法来求解模型。我们的方法与合成和真实视频剪辑上的其他模型的比较表明，我们的结果图像更准确，更少的文物。它还提供了更精细和可辨的细节。
