##### Abstract
In Brazil, all legal professionals must demonstrate their knowledge of the law and its application by passing the OAB exams, the national bar exams. The OAB exams therefore provide an excellent benchmark for the performance of legal information systems since passing the exam would arguably signal that the system has acquired capacity of legal reasoning comparable to that of a human lawyer. This article describes the construction of a new data set and some preliminary experiments on it, treating the problem of finding the justification for the answers to questions. The results provide a baseline performance measure against which to evaluate future improvements. We discuss the reasons to the poor performance and propose next steps.

在巴西，所有的法律专业人员都必须通过OAB考试和国家律师考试来证明自己的法律知识。因此，OAB考试为法律信息系统的绩效提供了极好的基准，因为通过考试可以证明该系统已经获得了与人类律师相当的法律推理能力。本文介绍了一个新的数据集的建设和一些初步的实验，处理找到问题的答案的理由问题。结果提供了评估未来改进的基准绩效指标。我们讨论导致绩效不佳的原因，并提出下一步措施。
