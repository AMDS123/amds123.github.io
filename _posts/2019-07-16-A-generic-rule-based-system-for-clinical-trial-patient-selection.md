##### Abstract
The n2c2 2018 Challenge task 1 aimed to identify patients who meet lists of heterogeneous inclusion/exclusion criteria for a hypothetical clinical trial. We demonstrate a generic rule-based natural language pipeline can support this task with decent performance (the average F1 score on the test set is 0.89, ranked the 8th out of 45 teams ).
