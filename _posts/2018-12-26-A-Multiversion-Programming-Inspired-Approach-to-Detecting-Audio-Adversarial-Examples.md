##### Abstract
Adversarial examples (AEs) are crafted by adding human-imperceptible perturbations to inputs such that a machine-learning based classifier incorrectly labels them. They have become a severe threat to the trustworthiness of machine learning. While AEs in the image domain have been well studied, audio AEs are less investigated. Recently, multiple techniques are proposed to generate audio AEs, which makes countermeasures against them an urgent task. Our experiments show that, given an AE, the transcription results by different Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems differ significantly, as they use different architectures, parameters, and training datasets. Inspired by Multiversion Programming, we propose a novel audio AE detection approach, which utilizes multiple off-the-shelf ASR systems to determine whether an audio input is an AE. The evaluation shows that the detection achieves accuracies over 98.6%.
