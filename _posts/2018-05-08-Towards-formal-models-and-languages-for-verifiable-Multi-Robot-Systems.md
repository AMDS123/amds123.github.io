##### Abstract
Incorrect operations of a Multi-Robot System (MRS) may not only lead to unsatisfactory results, but can also cause economic losses and threats to safety. These threats may not always be apparent, since they may arise as unforeseen consequences of the interactions between elements of the system. This call for tools and techniques that can help in providing guarantees about MRSs behaviour. We think that, whenever possible, these guarantees should be backed up by formal proofs to complement traditional approaches based on testing and simulation. 
 We believe that tailored linguistic support to specify MRSs is a major step towards this goal. In particular, reducing the gap between typical features of an MRS and the level of abstraction of the linguistic primitives would simplify both the specification of these systems and the verification of their properties. In this work, we review different agent-oriented languages and their features; we then consider a selection of case studies of interest and implement them useing the surveyed languages. We also evaluate and compare effectiveness of the proposed solution, considering, in particular, easiness of expressing non-trivial behaviour.

##### Abstract (translated by Google)
多机器人系统（MRS）的错误操作不仅会导致不理想的结果，而且还会造成经济损失和安全威胁。这些威胁可能并不总是显而易见的，因为它们可能是系统各要素之间相互作用的无法预料的后果。这需要有助于提供MRS行为保证的工具和技术。我们认为，只要有可能，这些保证应该由正式证明来支持，以补充基于测试和模拟的传统方法。
 我们相信，定制MRSs的语言支持是实现这一目标的重要一步。特别是，缩小MRS的典型特征与语言基元抽象级别之间的差距可以简化这些系统的规格并验证它们的属性。在这项工作中，我们回顾了不同的面向代理的语言及其功能;然后我们考虑选择一些感兴趣的案例研究，并实施他们使用调查语言。我们还评估和比较提出的解决方案的有效性，特别是考虑到表达非重要行为的容易性。
