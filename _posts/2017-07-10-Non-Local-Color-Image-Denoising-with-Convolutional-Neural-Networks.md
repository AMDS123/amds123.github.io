##### Abstract
We propose a novel deep network architecture for grayscale and color image denoising that is based on a non-local image model. Our motivation for the overall design of the proposed network stems from variational methods that exploit the inherent non-local self-similarity property of natural images. We build on this concept and introduce deep networks that perform non-local processing and at the same time they significantly benefit from discriminative learning. Experiments on the Berkeley segmentation dataset, comparing several state-of-the-art methods, show that the proposed non-local models achieve the best reported denoising performance both for grayscale and color images for all the tested noise levels. It is also worth noting that this increase in performance comes at no extra cost on the capacity of the network compared to existing alternative deep network architectures. In addition, we highlight a direct link of the proposed non-local models to convolutional neural networks. This connection is of significant importance since it allows our models to take full advantage of the latest advances on GPU computing in deep learning and makes them amenable to efficient implementations through their inherent parallelism.

我们提出了一个基于非局部图像模型的灰度和彩色图像去噪的深度网络体系结构。我们提出的网络整体设计的动机源于利用自然图像固有的非局部自相似性的变分方法。我们以这个概念为基础，引入深度网络，进行非本地处理，同时他们从歧视性学习中受益匪浅。伯克利分割数据集上的实验，比较了几种最先进的方法，表明所提出的非局部模型对于所有测试的噪声水平在灰度和彩色图像上都实现了最好的报告去噪性能。同样值得注意的是，与现有的替代深度网络架构相比，这种性能的提高并没有增加网络的容量。另外，我们强调了所提出的非局部模型与卷积神经网络的直接联系。这种联系非常重要，因为它可以让我们的模型在深度学习中充分利用GPU计算方面的最新进展，并通过它们固有的并行性使它们适应高效的实现。
