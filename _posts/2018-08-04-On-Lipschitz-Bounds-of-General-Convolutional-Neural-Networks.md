##### Abstract
Many convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have a feed-forward structure. In this paper, a linear program that estimates the Lipschitz bound of such CNNs is proposed. Several CNNs, including the scattering networks, the AlexNet and the GoogleNet, are studied numerically and compared to the theoretical bounds. Next, concentration inequalities of the output distribution to a stationary random input signal expressed in terms of the Lipschitz bound are established. The Lipschitz bound is further used to establish a nonlinear discriminant analysis designed to measure the separation between features of different classes.

##### Abstract (translated by Google)
许多卷积神经网络（CNN）具有前馈结构。在本文中，提出了一种估计这种CNN的Lipschitz界的线性程序。几个CNN，包括散射网络，AlexNet和GoogleNet，都在数值上进行了研究，并与理论界限进行了比较。接下来，建立输出分布到以Lipschitz界限表示的静止随机输入信号的浓度不等式。 Lipschitz界限进一步用于建立非线性判别分析，旨在测量不同类别的特征之间的分离。
