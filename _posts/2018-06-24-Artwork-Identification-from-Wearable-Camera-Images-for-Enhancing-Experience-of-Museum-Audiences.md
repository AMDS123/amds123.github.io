##### Abstract
Recommendation systems based on image recognition could prove a vital tool in enhancing the experience of museum audiences. However, for practical systems utilizing wearable cameras, a number of challenges exist which affect the quality of image recognition. In this pilot study, we focus on recognition of museum collections by using a wearable camera in three different museum spaces. We discuss the application of wearable cameras, and the practical and technical challenges in devising a robust system that can recognize artworks viewed by the visitors to create a detailed record of their visit. Specifically, to illustrate the impact of different kinds of museum spaces on image recognition, we collect three training datasets of museum exhibits containing variety of paintings, clocks, and sculptures. Subsequently, we equip selected visitors with wearable cameras to capture artworks viewed by them as they stroll along exhibitions. We use Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) which are pre-trained on the ImageNet dataset and fine-tuned on each of the training sets for the purpose of artwork identification. In the testing stage, we use CNNs to identify artworks captured by the visitors with a wearable camera. We analyze the accuracy of their recognition and provide an insight into the applicability of such a system to further engage audiences with museum exhibitions.

基于图像识别的推荐系统可以成为增强博物馆观众体验的重要工具。然而，对于使用可佩戴相机的实际系统，存在影响图像识别质量的许多挑战。在这项试点研究中，我们专注于在三个不同的博物馆空间中使用可穿戴相机识别博物馆收藏。我们讨论可穿戴相机的应用，以及设计一个强大的系统的实际和技术挑战，该系统可以识别访问者浏览的作品以创建其访问的详细记录。具体来说，为了说明不同类型的博物馆空间对图像识别的影响，我们收集了三个包含各种绘画，钟表和雕塑的博物馆展品的训练数据集。随后，我们为选定的参观者配备了可穿戴相机，以便在他们沿着展览漫步时拍摄他们观看的作品。我们使用在ImageNet数据集上预先训练好的卷积神经网络（CNN），并对每个训练集进行微调以达到艺术作品识别的目的。在测试阶段，我们使用CNN通过可穿戴相机识别访问者拍摄的作品。我们分析他们的认可的准确性，并提供一个这种系统的适用性进一步吸引观众与博物馆展览。
