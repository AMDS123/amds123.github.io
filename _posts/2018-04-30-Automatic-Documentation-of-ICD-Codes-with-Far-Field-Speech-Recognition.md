##### Abstract
Documentation errors increase healthcare costs and cause unnecessary patient deaths. As the standard language for diagnoses and billing, ICD codes serve as the foundation for medical documentation worldwide. Despite the prevalence of electronic medical records, hospitals still witness high levels of ICD miscoding. In this paper, we propose to automatically document ICD codes with far-field speech recognition. Far-field speech occurs when the microphone is located several meters from the source, as is common with smart homes and security systems. Our method combines acoustic signal processing with recurrent neural networks to recognize and document ICD codes in real time. To evaluate our model, we collected a far-field speech dataset of ICD-10 codes used in emergency departments and found our model to achieve 87% accuracy with a BLEU score of 85%. By sampling from an unsupervised medical language model, our method is able to outperform existing methods. This work shows the potential of automatic speech recognition to provide efficient, accurate, and cost-effective documentation.

文件错误会增加医疗成本并导致不必要的患者死亡。作为诊断和计费的标准语言，ICD代码是全球医疗文件的基础。尽管电子病历普遍存在，但医院仍然见证了高水平的ICD误码。在本文中，我们建议用远场语音识别自动记录ICD码。麦克风距离信号源几米时会发生远场语音，这与智能家居和安全系统常见的情况相同。我们的方法结合了声学信号处理和递归神经网络来实时识别和记录ICD代码。为了评估我们的模型，我们收集了用于急诊科的ICD-10代码的远场语音数据集，发现我们的模型在BLEU评分为85％时准确度达到了87％。通过从无监督的医学语言模型中抽样，我们的方法能够超越现有的方法。这项工作显示了自动语音识别的潜力，以提供高效，准确和具有成本效益的文档。
