##### Abstract
The classic supervised classification algorithms are efficient, but time-consuming, complicated and not interpretable, which makes it difficult to analyze their results that limits the possibility to improve them based on real observations. In this paper, we propose a new and a simple classifier to predict a sentiment label of a short text. This model keeps the capacity of human interpret-ability and can be extended to integrate NLP techniques in a more interpretable way. Our model is based on a correlation metric which measures the degree of association between a sentiment label and a word. Ten correlation metrics are proposed and evaluated intrinsically. And then a classifier based on each metric is proposed, evaluated and compared to the classic classification algorithms which have proved their performance in many studies. Our model outperforms these algorithms with several correlation metrics.

经典的监督分类算法是高效的，但费时，复杂且不可解释，这使得难以分析其结果，从而限制了基于真实观察来改进它们的可能性。在本文中，我们提出了一种新的和简单的分类器来预测短文本的情感标签。该模型保留了人类可解释能力的能力，并且可以扩展到以更易解释的方式整合NLP技术。我们的模型基于衡量情绪标签和单词之间关联程度的相关性度量。本质上提出并评估了十个相关度量标准。然后提出基于每个度量的分类器，对其进行评估并与经典分类算法进行比较，这些算法在许多研究中已经证明了它们的性能。我们的模型通过几个相关度量标准优于这些算法。
