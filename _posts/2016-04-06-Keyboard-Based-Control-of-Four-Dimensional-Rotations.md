##### Abstract
Aiming at applications to the scientific visualization of three dimensional simulations with time evolution, a keyboard based control method to specify rotations in four dimensions is proposed. It is known that four dimensional rotations are generally so-called double rotations, and a double rotation is a combination of simultaneously applied two simple rotations. The proposed method can specify both the simple and double rotations by single key typings of the keyboard. The method is tested in visualizations of a regular pentachoron in four dimensional space by a hyperplane slicing.

针对三维仿真时间演化的科学可视化应用，提出了一种基于键盘的四维旋转控制方法。众所周知，四维旋转一般是所谓的双旋转，双旋转是同时施加两个简单旋转的组合。所提出的方法可以通过键盘的单个键类型指定简单和双重旋转。通过超平面切片在四维空间中对正五边形的可视化进行测试。
