##### Abstract
To facilitate computer analysis of visual art, in the form of paintings, we introduce Pandora (Paintings Dataset for Recognizing the Art movement) database, a collection of digitized paintings labelled with respect to the artistic movement. Noting that the set of databases available as benchmarks for evaluation is highly reduced and most existing ones are limited in variability and number of images, we propose a novel large scale dataset of digital paintings. The database consists of more than 7700 images from 12 art movements. Each genre is illustrated by a number of images varying from 250 to nearly 1000. We investigate how local and global features and classification systems are able to recognize the art movement. Our experimental results suggest that accurate recognition is achievable by a combination of various categories.To facilitate computer analysis of visual art, in the form of paintings, we introduce Pandora (Paintings Dataset for Recognizing the Art movement) database, a collection of digitized paintings labelled with respect to the artistic movement.

为便于视觉艺术的电脑分析，以绘画的形式，我们介绍潘多拉（认识艺术运动的绘画数据库）数据库，这是一个关于艺术运动的数字化绘画集合。注意到可用作评估基准的数据库集大大减少，大多数现有数据库的可变性和图像数量有限，因此我们提出了一个新的大型数字绘画数据集。数据库包含来自12个艺术运动的7700多幅图像。每种类型都由250个到近1000个不等的图像来说明。我们调查局部和全局特征和分类系统如何识别艺术运动。我们的实验结果表明，可以通过各种类别的组合来实现准确的识别。为了便于视觉艺术的计算机分析，以绘画的形式，我们介绍了潘多拉（识别艺术运动的绘画数据集）数据库，一系列数字化绘画关于艺术运动。注意到可用作评估基准的数据库集大大减少，大多数现有数据库的可变性和图像数量有限，因此我们提出了一个新的大型数字绘画数据集。数据库包含来自12个艺术运动的7700多幅图像。每种类型都由250个到近1000个不等的图像来说明。我们调查局部和全局特征和分类系统如何识别艺术运动。我们的实验结果表明，通过各种类别的组合可以实现准确的识别。
