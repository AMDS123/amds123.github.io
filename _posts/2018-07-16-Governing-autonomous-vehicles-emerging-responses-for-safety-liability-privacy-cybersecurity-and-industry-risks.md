##### Abstract
The benefits of autonomous vehicles (AVs) are widely acknowledged, but there are concerns about the extent of these benefits and AV risks and unintended consequences. In this article, we first examine AVs and different categories of the technological risks associated with them. We then explore strategies that can be adopted to address these risks, and explore emerging responses by governments for addressing AV risks. Our analyses reveal that, thus far, governments have in most instances avoided stringent measures in order to promote AV developments and the majority of responses are non-binding and focus on creating councils or working groups to better explore AV implications. The US has been active in introducing legislations to address issues related to privacy and cybersecurity. The UK and Germany, in particular, have enacted laws to address liability issues, other countries mostly acknowledge these issues, but have yet to implement specific strategies. To address privacy and cybersecurity risks strategies ranging from introduction or amendment of non-AV specific legislation to creating working groups have been adopted. Much less attention has been paid to issues such as environmental and employment risks, although a few governments have begun programmes to retrain workers who might be negatively affected.

自动驾驶汽车（AVs）的好处得到了广泛认可，但人们担心这些益处和AV风险的程度以及意外后果。在本文中，我们首先检查AV和与其相关的技术风险的不同类别。然后，我们探索可用于解决这些风险的策略，并探索政府为解决AV风险而采取的新措施。我们的分析表明，到目前为止，政府在大多数情况下都采取了严格的措施来促进AV发展，而且大多数答复都没有约束力，并且专注于建立理事会或工作组以更好地探索AV影响。美国一直积极引入立法来解决与隐私和网络安全相关的问题。特别是英国和德国已经制定了解决责任问题的法律，其他国家大多承认这些问题，但尚未实施具体的战略。为了解决隐私和网络安全风险，已经采用了从引入或修订非AV特定立法到创建工作组的各种策略。虽然少数政府已开始对可能受到负面影响的工人进行再培训，但对环境和就业风险等问题的关注却少得多。
