##### Abstract
This paper studies the dynamic generator model for spatial-temporal processes such as dynamic textures and action sequences in video data. In this model, each time frame of the video sequence is generated by a generator model, which is a non-linear transformation of a latent state vector, where the non-linear transformation is parametrized by a top-down neural network. The sequence of latent state vectors follows a non-linear auto-regressive model, where the state vector of the next frame is a non-linear transformation of the state vector of the current frame as well as an independent noise vector that provides randomness in the transition. The non-linear transformation of this transition model can be parametrized by a feedforward neural network. We show that this model can be learned by an alternating back-propagation through time algorithm that iteratively samples the noise vectors and updates the parameters in the transition model and the generator model. We show that our training method can learn realistic models for dynamic textures and action patterns.
