##### Abstract
Coronary angiography is considered to be a safe tool for the evaluation of coronary artery disease and perform in approximately 12 million patients each year worldwide. [1] In most cases, angiograms are manually analyzed by a cardiologist. Actually, there are no clinical practice algorithms which could improve and automate this work. Neural networks show high efficiency in tasks of image analysis and they can be used for the analysis of angiograms and facilitate diagnostics. We have developed an algorithm based on Convolutional Neural Network and Neural Network U-Net [2] for vessels segmentation and defects detection such as stenosis. For our research we used anonymized angiography data obtained from one of the city's hospitals and augmented them to improve learning efficiency. U-Net usage provided high quality segmentation and the combination of our algorithm with an ensemble of classifiers shows a good accuracy in the task of ischemia evaluation on test data. Subsequently, this approach can be served as a basis for the creation of an analytical system that could speed up the diagnosis of cardiovascular diseases and greatly facilitate the work of a specialist.

##### Abstract (translated by Google)
冠状动脉造影被认为是评估冠状动脉疾病的安全工具，每年在全球约有1200万患者中进行。 [1]在大多数情况下，血管造影是由心脏病专家手动分析的。实际上，没有临床实践算法可以改善和自动化这项工作。神经网络在图像分析任务中表现出高效率，可用于血管造影分析和诊断。我们开发了一种基于卷积神经网络和神经网络U-Net的算法[2]，用于血管分割和狭窄等缺陷检测。对于我们的研究，我们使用了从该市一家医院获得的匿名血管造影数据，并对其进行了扩充，以提高学习效率。 U-Net的使用提供了高质量的分割，并且我们的算法与分类器集合的组合在测试数据的缺血评估任务中显示出良好的准确性。随后，这种方法可以作为创建一个分析系统的基础，可以加速心血管疾病的诊断，并极大地方便专家的工作。
