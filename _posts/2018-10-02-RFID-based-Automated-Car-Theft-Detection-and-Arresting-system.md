##### Abstract
In this paper, we are presenting a new approach to car theft detection and arresting system using RFID technology. The main purpose of this paper is to establish the concept and the architecture of the whole system. The system which we are able to develop still now is basically a demonstration model or a prototype of the system. The key thing in this system is the passive RFID tags which will be hidden inside the car and act as a unique identification number for the car. The information of all such tags will be maintained by a centralized server. In case of any car being theft, a report should be logged into the server by an authorized user and a network of RFID scanners installed in different check post, traffic signal or toll plazas in the city will search for the reported tag. Once it is found necessary security system would be activated for arresting the car.
