##### Abstract
A novel probabilistic perception algorithm is presented as a real-time joint solution to data association, object tracking, and object classification for an autonomous ground vehicle in all-weather conditions. The presented algorithm extends a Rao-Blackwellized Particle Filter originally built with a particle filter for data association and a Kalman filter for multi-object tracking (Miller et al. 2011a) to now also include multiple model tracking for classification. Additionally a state-of-the-art vision detection algorithm that includes heading information for autonomous ground vehicle (AGV) applications was implemented. Cornell's AGV from the DARPA Urban Challenge was upgraded and used to experimentally examine if and how state-of-the-art vision algorithms can complement or replace lidar and radar sensors. Sensor and algorithm performance in adverse weather and lighting conditions is tested. Experimental evaluation demonstrates robust all-weather data association, tracking, and classification where camera, lidar, and radar sensors complement each other inside the joint probabilistic perception algorithm.

提出了一种新颖的概率感知算法作为全天候条件下自主地面车辆的数据关联，目标跟踪和目标分类的实时联合解决方案。所提出的算法扩展了一个Rao-Blackwellized粒子滤波器，该滤波器最初由用于数据关联的粒子滤波器和用于多目标跟踪的卡尔曼滤波器（Miller等，2011a）构建，现在还包括用于分类的多模型跟踪。此外，还实施了包括自主地面车辆（AGV）应用的航向信息的最新视觉检测算法。来自DARPA城市挑战赛的康奈尔AGV进行了升级，并用于通过实验来检验最新的视觉算法是否以及如何补充或取代激光雷达和雷达传感器。测试不利天气和照明条件下的传感器和算法性能。实验评估显示了强大的全天候数据关联，跟踪和分类，其中相机，激光雷达和雷达传感器在联合概率感知算法内相互补充。
