##### Abstract
In this research work, probabilistic decision-making approaches are studied, e.g. Bayesian and Boltzmann strategies, along with various deterministic exploration strategies, e.g. greedy, epsilon-Greedy and random approaches. In this research work, a comparative study has been done between probabilistic and deterministic decision-making approaches, the experiments are performed in OpenAI gym environment, solving Cart Pole problem. This research work discusses about the Bayesian approach to decision-making in deep reinforcement learning, and about dropout, how it can reduce the computational cost. All the exploration approaches are compared. It also discusses about the importance of exploration in deep reinforcement learning, and how improving exploration strategies may help in science and technology. This research work shows how probabilistic decision-making approaches are better in the long run as compared to the deterministic approaches. When there is uncertainty, Bayesian dropout approach proved to be better than all other approaches in this research work.
