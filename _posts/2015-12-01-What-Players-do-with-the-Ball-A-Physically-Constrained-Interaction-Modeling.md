##### Abstract
Tracking the ball is critical for video-based analysis of team sports. However, it is difficult, especially in low-resolution images, due to the small size of the ball, its speed that creates motion blur, and its often being occluded by players. In this paper, we propose a generic and principled approach to modeling the interaction between the ball and the players while also imposing appropriate physical constraints on the ball's trajectory. We show that our approach, formulated in terms of a Mixed Integer Program, is more robust and more accurate than several state-of-the-art approaches on real-life volleyball, basketball, and soccer sequences.

跟踪球是基于视频的团队运动分析的关键。但是，由于球的尺寸小，运动模糊的速度以及球员经常被遮挡，所以很难，特别是在低分辨率的图像中。在本文中，我们提出了一个通用和原则的方法来模拟球和球员之间的相互作用，同时也对球的轨迹施加适当的物理约束。我们表明，我们的方法，混合整数计划制定，比现实生活中的排球，篮球和足球序列的几种最先进的方法更强大和更准确。
