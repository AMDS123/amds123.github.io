##### Abstract
Spelling errors are introduced in text either during typing, or when the user does not know the correct phoneme or grapheme. If a language contains complex words like sandhi where two or more morphemes join based on some rules, spell checking becomes very tedious. In such situations, having a spell checker with sandhi splitter which alerts the user by flagging the errors and providing suggestions is very useful. A novel algorithm of sandhi splitting is proposed in this paper. The sandhi splitter can split about 7000 most common sandhi words in Kannada language used as test samples. The sandhi splitter was integrated with a Kannada spell checker and a mechanism for generating suggestions was added. A comprehensive, platform independent, standalone spell checker with sandhi splitter application software was thus developed and tested extensively for its efficiency and correctness. A comparative analysis of this spell checker with sandhi splitter was made and results concluded that the Kannada spell checker with sandhi splitter has an improved performance. It is twice as fast, 200 times more space efficient, and it is 90% accurate in case of complex nouns and 50% accurate for complex verbs. Such a spell checker with sandhi splitter will be of foremost significance in machine translation systems, voice processing, etc. This is the first sandhi splitter in Kannada and the advantage of the novel algorithm is that, it can be extended to all Indian languages.

拼写错误在文本中或者在用户不知道正确的音素或字形时在文本中引入。如果一个语言包含了一些复杂的词，如sandhi，根据一些规则，两个或多个词素连接在一起，拼写检查变得非常单调乏味。在这种情况下，使用sandhi splitter拼写检查器通过标记错误并提供建议来提醒用户非常有用。本文提出了一种新的分散算法。 sandhi拆分器可以分解大约7000个最常用的以Kannada语言作为测试样本的sandhi词。 sandhi分配器与Kannada拼写检查器集成在一起，并添加了一个生成建议的机制。因此，开发了一个全面的，独立于平台的，独立的拼写检查程序，并使用sandhi splitter应用程序软件进行了广泛的测试，以确保其效率和正确性。这个拼写检查器与sandhi splitter进行了比较分析，结果表明，与sandhi splitter卡纳达语拼写检查器有一个改进的性能。速度提高一倍，空间效率提高200倍，复杂名词的准确度为90％，复杂动词的准确率为50％。这样的一个拼写检查器，在机器翻译系统，语音处理等方面具有非常重要的意义。这是卡纳达语中的第一个sandhi分词器，新算法的优点是可以扩展到所有印度语言。
