##### Abstract
3D imaging modalities are becoming increasingly popular and relevant in retinal imaging owing to their effectiveness in highlighting structures in sub-retinal layers. OCT is one such modality which has great importance in the context of analysis of cystoid structures in subretinal layers. Signal to noise ratio(SNR) of the images obtained from OCT is less and hence automated and accurate determination of cystoid structures from OCT is a challenging task. We propose an automated method for detecting/segmenting cysts in 3D OCT volumes. The proposed method is biologically inspired and fast aided by the domain knowledge about the cystoid structures. An ensemble learning methodRandom forests is learnt for classification of detected region into cyst region. The method achieves detection and segmentation in a unified setting. We believe the proposed approach with further improvements can be a promising starting point for more robust approach. This method is validated against the training set achieves a mean dice coefficient of 0.3893 with a standard deviation of 0.2987

3D成像模式在视网膜成像中变得越来越流行和相关，因为它们有效地突出了视网膜下层的结构。 OCT是一种在分析视网膜下层囊样结构方面具有重要意义的方式。从OCT获得的图像的信噪比（SNR）较小，因此自动化和准确测定来自OCT的囊样结构是具有挑战性的任务。我们提出了一种自动化方法来检测/分割三维OCT体积中的囊肿。所提出的方法是生物启发和快速帮助的领域知识囊样结构。学习集合学习方法随机森林将被检测区域分类为囊肿区域。该方法实现了统一设置下的检测和分割。我们相信所提出的进一步改进的方法可能是一个更有前途的开始点，以更强大的方法。该方法通过训练集验证了0.3893的平均模子系数和0.2987的标准偏差
