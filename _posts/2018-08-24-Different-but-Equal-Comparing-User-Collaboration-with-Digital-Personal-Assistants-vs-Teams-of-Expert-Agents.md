##### Abstract
This work compares user collaboration with conversational personal assistants vs. teams of expert chatbots. Two studies were performed to investigate whether each approach affects accomplishment of tasks and collaboration costs. Participants interacted with two equivalent financial advice chatbot systems, one composed of a single conversational adviser and the other based on a team of four experts chatbots. Results indicated that users had different forms of experiences but were equally able to achieve their goals. Contrary to the expected, there were evidences that in the teamwork situation that users were more able to predict agent behavior better and did not have an overhead to maintain common ground, indicating similar collaboration costs. The results point towards the feasibility of either of the two approaches for user collaboration with conversational agents.

这项工作将用户协作与会话式个人助理与专家聊天机器人团队进行比较。进行了两项研究，以调查每种方法是否影响任务的完成和协作成本。参与者与两个相同的财务建议聊天机器人系统进行了互动，一个由一个会话顾问组成，另一个基于四个专家聊天机器人的团队。结果表明，用户有不同形式的经验，但同样能够实现他们的目标。与预期相反，有证据表明，在团队合作的情况下，用户更能够更好地预测代理行为，并且没有维持共同点的开销，这表明类似的协作成本。结果表明用户与会话代理协作的两种方法中的任何一种的可行性。
