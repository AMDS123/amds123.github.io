##### Abstract
The color sensation evoked by an object depends on both the spectral power distribution of the illumination and the reflectance properties of the object being illuminated. The color sensation can be characterized by three color-space values, such as XYZ, RGB, HSV, L*a*b*, etc. It is straightforward to compute the three values given the illuminant and reflectance curves. The converse process of computing a reflectance curve given the color-space values and the illuminant is complicated by the fact that an infinite number of different reflectance curves can give rise to a single set of color-space values (metamerism). This paper presents five algorithms for generating a reflectance curve from a specified sRGB triplet, written for a general audience. The algorithms are designed to generate reflectance curves that are similar to those found with naturally occurring colored objects. The computed reflectance curves are compared to a database of thousands of reflectance curves measured from paints and pigments available both commercially and in nature, and the similarity is quantified. One particularly useful application of these algorithms is in the field of computer graphics, where modeling color transformations sometimes requires wavelength-specific information, such as when modeling subtractive color mixture.
