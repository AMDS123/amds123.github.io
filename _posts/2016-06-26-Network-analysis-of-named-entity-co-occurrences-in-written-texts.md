##### Abstract
The use of methods borrowed from statistics and physics to analyze written texts has allowed the discovery of unprecedent patterns of human behavior and cognition by establishing links between models features and language structure. While current models have been useful to unveil patterns via analysis of syntactical and semantical networks, only a few works have probed the relevance of investigating the structure arising from the relationship between relevant entities such as characters, locations and organizations. In this study, we represent entities appearing in the same context as a co-occurrence network, where links are established according to a null model based on random, shuffled texts. Computational simulations performed in novels revealed that the proposed model displays interesting topological features, such as the small world feature, characterized by high values of clustering coefficient. The effectiveness of our model was verified in a practical pattern recognition task in real networks. When compared with traditional word adjacency networks, our model displayed optimized results in identifying unknown references in texts. Because the proposed representation plays a complementary role in characterizing unstructured documents via topological analysis of named entities, we believe that it could be useful to improve the characterization of written texts (and related systems), specially if combined with traditional approaches based on statistical and deeper paradigms.

##### Abstract (translated by Google)
运用统计学和物理学的方法分析书面文本，可以通过建立模型特征和语言结构之间的联系，发现人类行为和认知的前所未有的模式。虽然目前的模型通过分析句法和语义网络来发现模式是有用的，但只有少数作品探讨了调查由相关实体（如人物，地点和组织）之间的关系引起的结构的相关性。在这项研究中，我们代表实体出现在同一上下文中作为共现网络，其中链接是根据随机混合文本的空模型建立的。在小说中进行的计算模拟表明，所提出的模型显示出有趣的拓扑特征，例如以高聚类系数值为特征的小世界特征。我们的模型的有效性在实际网络中的实际模式识别任务中被验证。当与传统的字邻接网络相比，我们的模型显示优化的结果在识别文本中的未知引用。由于提出的代表性在通过命名实体的拓扑分析来表征非结构化文档方面起到了补充作用，所以我们相信，改进书面文本（和相关系统）的特征可能是有用的，特别是如果与基于统计学和更深层次的传统方法相结合范式。
