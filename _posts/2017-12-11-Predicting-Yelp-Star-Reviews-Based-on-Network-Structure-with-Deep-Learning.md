##### Abstract
In this paper, we tackle the real-world problem of predicting Yelp star-review rating based on business features (such as images, descriptions), user features (average previous ratings), and, of particular interest, network properties (which businesses has a user rated before). We compare multiple models on different sets of features -- from simple linear regression on network features only to deep learning models on network and item features. In recent years, breakthroughs in deep learning have led to increased accuracy in common supervised learning tasks, such as image classification, captioning, and language understanding. However, the idea of combining deep learning with network feature and structure appears to be novel. While the problem of predicting future interactions in a network has been studied at length, these approaches have often ignored either node-specific data or global structure. We demonstrate that taking a mixed approach combining both node-level features and network information can effectively be used to predict Yelp-review star ratings. We evaluate on the Yelp dataset by splitting our data along the time dimension (as would naturally occur in the real-world) and comparing our model against others which do no take advantage of the network structure and/or deep learning.

在本文中，我们根据业务特征（如图像，描述），用户特征（以前的平均评级）以及特别感兴趣的网络特性（企业已有的特征）来处理预测Yelp星评级的现实问题用户之前评分）。我们比较不同功能集上的多个模型 - 从网络功能的简单线性回归到网络和项目功能的深度学习模型。近年来，深度学习的突破导致了图像分类，字幕，语言理解等常见监督学习任务的准确性提高。然而，将深度学习与网络特征和结构相结合的想法似乎是新颖的。虽然对网络中未来相互作用的预测问题进行了长时间的研究，但这些方法经常忽略节点特定数据或全局结构。我们证明，结合节点级功能和网络信息的混合方法可以有效地用于预测Yelp评论的星级评级。我们通过在时间维度上分割我们的数据（就像在现实世界中自然发生的那样）并且将我们的模型与没有利用网络结构和/或深度学习的模型进行比较来评估Yelp数据集。
