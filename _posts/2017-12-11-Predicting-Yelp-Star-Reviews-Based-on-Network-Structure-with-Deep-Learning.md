##### Abstract
In this paper, we tackle the real-world problem of predicting Yelp star-review rating based on business features (such as images, descriptions), user features (average previous ratings), and, of particular interest, network properties (which businesses has a user rated before). We compare multiple models on different sets of features -- from simple linear regression on network features only to deep learning models on network and item features. In recent years, breakthroughs in deep learning have led to increased accuracy in common supervised learning tasks, such as image classification, captioning, and language understanding. However, the idea of combining deep learning with network feature and structure appears to be novel. While the problem of predicting future interactions in a network has been studied at length, these approaches have often ignored either node-specific data or global structure. We demonstrate that taking a mixed approach combining both node-level features and network information can effectively be used to predict Yelp-review star ratings. We evaluate on the Yelp dataset by splitting our data along the time dimension (as would naturally occur in the real-world) and comparing our model against others which do no take advantage of the network structure and/or deep learning.

在本文中，我们根据业务功能（如图像，描述），用户功能（平均以前的评级）以及特别感兴趣的网络属性（企业拥有）来解决预测Yelp星评评级的现实问题。用户评分之前）。我们在不同的特征集上比较多个模型 - 从仅网络特征的简单线性回归到网络和项目特征的深度学习模型。近年来，深度学习的突破已经提高了共同监督学习任务的准确性，例如图像分类，字幕和语言理解。然而，将深度学习与网络特征和结构相结合的想法似乎是新颖的。虽然已经详细研究了预测网络中未来交互的问题，但这些方法经常忽略节点特定数据或全局结构。我们证明采用结合节点级功能和网络信息的混合方法可以有效地用于预测Yelp评论星级。我们通过在时间维度上分割我们的数据（在现实世界中自然发生）并将我们的模型与不利用网络结构和/或深度学习的其他模型进行比较来评估Yelp数据集。
