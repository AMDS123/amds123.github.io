##### Abstract
This paper addresses challenges of Natural Language Processing (NLP) on non-canonical multilingual data in which two or more languages are mixed. It refers to code-switching which has become more popular in our daily life and therefore obtains an increasing amount of attention from the research community. We report our experience that cov- ers not only core NLP tasks such as normalisation, language identification, language modelling, part-of-speech tagging and dependency parsing but also more downstream ones such as machine translation and automatic speech recognition. We highlight and discuss the key problems for each of the tasks with supporting examples from different language pairs and relevant previous work.

##### Abstract (translated by Google)
本文讨论了非规范多语言数据中的自然语言处理（NLP）挑战，其中混合了两种或更多种语言。它是指在我们日常生活中越来越流行的代码转换，因此越来越受到研究界的关注。我们汇报了我们的经验，不仅涵盖了归一化，语言识别，语言建模，词性标注和依赖分析等核心NLP任务，而且涵盖了机器翻译和自动语音识别等更为下游的任务。我们通过不同语言对的配套实例和以前的相关工作来突出和讨论每个任务的关键问题。
