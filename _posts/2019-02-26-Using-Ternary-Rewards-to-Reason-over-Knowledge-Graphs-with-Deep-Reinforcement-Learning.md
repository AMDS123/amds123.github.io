##### Abstract
In this paper, we investigate the practical challenges of using reinforcement learning agents for question-answering over knowledge graphs. We examine the performance metrics used by state-of-the-art systems and determine that they are inadequate. More specifically, they do not evaluate the systems correctly for situations when there is no answer available and thus agents optimized for these metrics are poor at modeling confidence. We introduce a simple new performance metric for evaluating question-answering agents that is more representative of practical usage conditions, and optimize for this metric by extending the binary reward structure used in prior work to a ternary reward structure which also rewards an agent for not answering a question rather than giving an incorrect answer. We show that this can drastically improve the precision of answered questions while only not answering a limited number of questions that were previously answered correctly.
