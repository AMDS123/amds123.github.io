##### Abstract
There is increasing awareness in the planning community that the burden of specifying complete domain models is too high, which impedes the applicability of planning technology in many real-world domains. Although there have many learning systems that help automatically learning domain models, most existing work assumes that the input traces are completely correct. A more realistic situation is that the plan traces are disordered and noisy, such as plan traces described by natural language. In this paper we propose and evaluate an approach for doing this. Our approach takes as input a set of plan traces with disordered actions and noise and outputs action models that can best explain the plan traces. We use a MAX-SAT framework for learning, where the constraints are derived from the given plan traces. Unlike traditional action models learners, the states in plan traces can be partially observable and noisy as well as the actions in plan traces can be disordered and parallel. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through a systematic empirical evaluation with both IPC domains and the real-world dataset extracted from natural language documents.
