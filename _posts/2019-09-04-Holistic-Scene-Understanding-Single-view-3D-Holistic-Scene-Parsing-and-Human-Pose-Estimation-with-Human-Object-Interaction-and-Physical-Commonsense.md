##### Abstract
We propose a new 3D holistic++ scene understanding problem, which jointly tackles two tasks from a single-view image: (i) holistic scene parsing and reconstruction---3D estimations of object bounding boxes, camera pose, and room layout, and (ii) 3D human pose estimation. The intuition behind is to leverage the coupled nature of these two tasks to improve the granularity and performance of scene understanding. We propose to exploit two critical and essential connections between these two tasks: (i) human-object interaction (HOI) to model the fine-grained relations between agents and objects in the scene, and (ii) physical commonsense to model the physical plausibility of the reconstructed scene. The optimal configuration of the 3D scene, represented by a parse graph, is inferred using Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC), which efficiently traverses through the non-differentiable joint solution space. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm significantly improves the performance of the two tasks on three datasets, showing an improved generalization ability.
