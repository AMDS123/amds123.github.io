##### Abstract
This paper presents an application of evolutionary search procedures to artificial neural networks. Here, we can distinguish among three kinds of evolution in artificial neural networks, i.e. the evolution of connection weights, of architectures, and of learning rules. We review each kind of evolution in detail and analyse critical issues related to different evolutions. This article concentrates on finding the suitable way of using evolutionary algorithms for optimizing the artificial neural network parameters.
