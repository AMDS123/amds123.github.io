##### Abstract
In this paper, we address the problem of multiple view data fusion in the presence of noise and interferences. Recent studies have approached this problem using kernel methods, by relying particularly on a product of kernels constructed separately for each view. From a graph theory point of view, we analyze this fusion approach in a discrete setting. More specifically, based on a statistical model for the connectivity between data points, we propose an algorithm for the selection of the kernel bandwidth, a parameter, which, as we show, has important implications on the robustness of this fusion approach to interferences. Then, we consider the fusion of audio-visual speech signals measured by a single microphone and by a video camera pointed to the face of the speaker. Specifically, we address the task of voice activity detection, i.e., the detection of speech and non-speech segments, in the presence of structured interferences such as keyboard taps and office noise. We propose an algorithm for voice activity detection based on the audio-visual signal. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm outperforms competing fusion and voice activity detection approaches. In addition, we demonstrate that a proper selection of the kernel bandwidth indeed leads to improved performance.

在本文中，我们解决了在存在噪声和干扰的情况下多视点数据融合的问题。最近的研究已经利用内核方法来解决这个问题，特别依赖于为每个视图单独构建的内核产品。从图论的角度来看，我们分析了这种融合方法。更具体地说，基于数据点之间连通性的统计模型，我们提出了一个选择内核带宽的算法，这个参数如我们所示，对于这种融合干扰方法的鲁棒性具有重要意义。然后，我们考虑由单个麦克风测量的视听语音信号与指向扬声器表面的摄像机的融合。具体来说，我们针对话音活动检测的任务，即在存在诸如键盘敲击和办公室噪声之类的结构化干扰的情况下检测语音和非语音片段。我们提出一种基于视听信号的语音活动检测算法。仿真结果表明，该算法优于竞争融合和语音活动检测方法。另外，我们证明，正确选择内核带宽确实会提高性能。
