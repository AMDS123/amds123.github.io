##### Abstract
We developed a machine vision system to automatically capture the dynamics of pedestrians under four different traffic scenarios. By considering the overhead view of each pedestrian as a digital object, the system processes the image sequences to track the pedestrians. Considering the perspective effect of the camera lens and the projected area of the hallway at the top-view scene, the distance of each tracked object from its original position to its current position is approximated every video frame. Using the approximated distance and the video frame rate (30 frames per second), the respective velocity and acceleration of each tracked object are later derived. The quantified motion characteristics of the pedestrians are displayed by the system through 2-dimensional graphs of the kinematics of motion. The system also outputs video images of the pedestrians with superimposed markers for tracking. These visual markers were used to visually describe and quantify the behavior of the pedestrians under different traffic scenarios.

我们开发了一个机器视觉系统，可以在四种不同的交通情况下自动捕捉行人的动态。通过考虑每个行人的俯视图作为数字对象，系统处理图像序列以追踪行人。考虑到摄像机镜头的透视效果和俯视场景下走廊的投影面积，每个被摄体从原始位置到当前位置的距离在每个视频帧都近似。使用近似距离和视频帧速率（每秒30帧），稍后导出每个被跟踪对象的相应速度和加速度。系统通过运动的运动学的二维图来显示行人的量化的运动特征。系统还输出行人的视频图像，并叠加标记用于跟踪。这些视觉标记被用来可视化地描述和量化在不同交通场景下行人的行为。
