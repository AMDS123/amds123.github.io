##### Abstract
Regular medical records are useful for medical practitioners to analyze and monitor patient health status especially for those with chronic disease, but such records are usually incomplete due to unpunctuality and absence of patients. In order to resolve the missing data problem over time, tensor-based model is suggested for missing data imputation in recent papers because this approach makes use of low rank tensor assumption for highly correlated data. However, when the time intervals between records are long, the data correlation is not high along temporal direction and such assumption is not valid. To address this problem, we propose to decompose a matrix with missing data into its latent factors. Then, the locally linear constraint is imposed on these factors for matrix completion in this paper. By using a publicly available dataset and two medical datasets collected from hospital, experimental results show that the proposed algorithm achieves the best performance by comparing with the existing methods.

定期的医疗记录对于医生来说尤其对于慢性病患者的病人健康状况进行分析和监测是有用的，但是由于不准时和患者不存在，这些记录通常是不完整的。为了解决丢失的数据问题随着时间的推移，建议张量为基础的模型缺失数据插补在最近的论文，因为这种方法使用低秩张量假设的高度相关的数据。但是，当记录之间的时间间隔很长时，数据相关性在时间方向上不高，并且这种假设是无效的。为了解决这个问题，我们建议将一个缺失数据的矩阵分解成它的潜在因素。然后，对这些矩阵完成的因素施加局部线性约束。通过使用公开的数据集和从医院收集的两个医学数据集，实验结果表明，该算法与现有方法相比，性能达到最佳。
