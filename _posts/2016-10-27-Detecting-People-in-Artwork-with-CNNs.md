##### Abstract
CNNs have massively improved performance in object detection in photographs. However research into object detection in artwork remains limited. We show state-of-the-art performance on a challenging dataset, People-Art, which contains people from photos, cartoons and 41 different artwork movements. We achieve this high performance by fine-tuning a CNN for this task, thus also demonstrating that training CNNs on photos results in overfitting for photos: only the first three or four layers transfer from photos to artwork. Although the CNN's performance is the highest yet, it remains less than 60\% AP, suggesting further work is needed for the cross-depiction problem. The final publication is available at Springer via this http URL

CNN在照片中的物体检测方面有了显着的改进。然而，对艺术品中物体检测的研究仍然有限。我们在具有挑战性的数据集People-Art上展示了最先进的表现，其中包含来自照片，漫画和41种不同艺术品动作的人物。我们通过对CNN进行微调来达到这个高性能，因此也证明了对照片进行CNN训练导致照片过度适应：只有前三到四个图层从照片转移到图片。尽管美国有线电视新闻网的表现最高，但仍然不到60％的美联社，这意味着交叉描述问题需要进一步的工作。最终的出版物可以通过这个http URL在Springer上找到
