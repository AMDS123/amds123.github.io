##### Abstract
Convolutional Neural Networks have been highly successful in performing a host of computer vision tasks such as object recognition, object detection, image segmentation and texture synthesis. In 2015, Gatys et. al [7] show how the style of a painter can be extracted from an image of the painting and applied to another normal photograph, thus recreating the photo in the style of the painter. The method has been successfully applied to a wide range of images and has since spawned multiple applications and mobile apps. In this paper, the neural style transfer algorithm is applied to fashion so as to synthesize new custom clothes. We construct an approach to personalize and generate new custom clothes based on a users preference and by learning the users fashion choices from a limited set of clothes from their closet. The approach is evaluated by analyzing the generated images of clothes and how well they align with the users fashion style.

卷积神经网络在执行许多计算机视觉任务（如物体识别，物体检测，图像分割和纹理合成）方面取得了巨大的成功。 2015年，Gatys et。 [7]展示了如何从绘画的图像中提取画家的风格，并将其应用到另一张普通的照片上，从而以画家的风格再现照片。该方法已成功应用于各种图像，并从此衍生出多个应用程序和移动应用程序。本文将神经风格转移算法应用于时尚，以综合新的定制服装。我们构建了一种方法，根据用户的偏好个性化和生成新的定制服装，并从衣柜中从有限的衣服中了解用户的时尚选择。通过分析生成的服装图像以及它们与用户时尚风格的一致性来评估该方法。
