##### Abstract
Skeleton based action recognition distinguishes human actions using the trajectories of skeleton joints, which provide a very good representation for describing actions. Considering that recurrent neural networks (RNNs) with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) can learn feature representations and model long-term temporal dependencies automatically, we propose an end-to-end fully connected deep LSTM network for skeleton based action recognition. Inspired by the observation that the co-occurrences of the joints intrinsically characterize human actions, we take the skeleton as the input at each time slot and introduce a novel regularization scheme to learn the co-occurrence features of skeleton joints. To train the deep LSTM network effectively, we propose a new dropout algorithm which simultaneously operates on the gates, cells, and output responses of the LSTM neurons. Experimental results on three human action recognition datasets consistently demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model.

基于骨架的动作识别使用骨架关节的轨迹来区分人的动作，这为描述动作提供了非常好的表示。考虑到长时间短时记忆（LSTM）的递归神经网络能够自动学习特征表示和长时间依赖关系模型，我们提出了一个基于骨架的动作识别的端到端完全连接的深度LSTM网络。受关节共生发生本质上人类行为特征的启发，以骨架为输入，引入一种新的正则化方法来学习骨骼关节的共现特征。为了有效地训练深度LSTM网络，我们提出了一种同时在LSTM神经元的门，单元和输出响应上运行的新的丢失算法。三个人类动作识别数据集的实验结果一致证明了该模型的有效性。
