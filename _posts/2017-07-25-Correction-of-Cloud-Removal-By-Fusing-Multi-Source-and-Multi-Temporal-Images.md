##### Abstract
Remote sensing images often suffer from cloud cover. Cloud removal is required in many applications of remote sensing images. Multitemporal-based methods are popular and effective to cope with thick clouds. This paper contributes to a summarization and experimental comparation of the existing multitemporal-based methods. Furthermore, we propose a spatiotemporal-fusion with poisson-adjustment method to fuse multi-sensor and multi-temporal images for cloud removal. The experimental results show that the proposed method has potential to address the problem of accuracy reduction of cloud removal in multi-temporal images with significant changes.

遥感图像经常遭受云层覆盖。在许多遥感图像应用中需要去除云。基于多时钟的方法对于处理厚厚的云层而言是流行和有效的。本文有助于总结和实验比较现有的基于多时钟的方法。此外，我们提出了一种利用泊松调整方法的时空融合方法，将多传感器和多时相图像融合去除云层。实验结果表明，该方法有潜力解决多时相图像云量去除的准确性降低的问题。
