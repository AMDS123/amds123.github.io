##### Abstract
Extracting shape information from object bound- aries is a well studied problem in vision, and has found tremen- dous use in applications like object recognition. Conversely, studying the space of shapes represented by curves satisfying certain constraints is also intriguing. In this paper, we model and analyze the space of shapes represented by a 3D curve (space curve) formed by connecting n pieces of quarter of a unit circle. Such a space curve is what we call a Tangle, the name coming from a toy built on the same principle. We provide two models for the shape space of n-link open and closed tangles, and we show that tangles are a subset of trigonometric splines of a certain order. We give algorithms for curve approximation using open/closed tangles, computing geodesics on these shape spaces, and to find the deformation that takes one given tangle to another given tangle, i.e., the Log map. The algorithms provided yield tangles upto a small and acceptable tolerance, as shown by the results given in the paper.

从对象边界中提取形状信息是一个很好的视觉问题研究，并发现在诸如对象识别等应用中有着巨大的应用。相反，研究满足一定约束条件的曲线形状的空间也是有趣的。在本文中，我们对由连接n个四分之一单位圆所形成的3D曲线（空间曲线）所表示的形状空间进行建模和分析。这样的空间曲线就是我们所说的“Tangle”，这个名字来源于同样原理的玩具。我们提供了两个模型的形状空间n连杆打开和关闭缠结，我们显示缠结是一个三角样条的一个特定顺序的子集。我们给出了使用开/关缠结曲线近似的算法，计算这些形状空间上的测地线，并找出将给定缠结带到另一给定缠结（即，对数映射）的变形。如文中给出的结果所示，算法提供了一个小的可接受的容差。
