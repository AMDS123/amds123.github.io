##### Abstract
Image retrieval under varying illumination conditions, such as day and night images, is addressed by image preprocessing, both hand-crafted and learned. Prior to extracting image descriptors by a convolutional neural network, images are photometrically normalised in order to reduce the descriptor sensitivity to illumination changes. We propose a learnable normalisation based on the U-Net architecture, which is trained on a combination of single-camera multi-exposure images and a newly constructed collection of similar views of landmarks during day and night. We experimentally show that both hand-crafted normalisation based on local histogram equalisation and the learnable normalisation outperform standard approaches in varying illumination conditions, while staying on par with the state-of-the-art methods on daylight illumination benchmarks, such as Oxford or Paris datasets.
