##### Abstract
Several methods have recently been proposed to analyze speech and automatically infer the personality of the speaker. These methods often rely on prosodic and other hand crafted speech processing features extracted with off-the-shelf toolboxes. To achieve high accuracy, numerous features are typically extracted using complex and highly parameterized algorithms. In this paper, a new method based on feature learning and spectrogram analysis is proposed to simplify the feature extraction process while maintaining a high level of accuracy. The proposed method learns a dictionary of discriminant features from patches extracted in the spectrogram representations of training speech segments. Each speech segment is then encoded using the dictionary, and the resulting feature set is used to perform classification of personality traits. Experiments indicate that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art results with a significant reduction in complexity when compared to the most recent reference methods. The number of features, and difficulties linked to the feature extraction process are greatly reduced as only one type of descriptors is used, for which the 6 parameters can be tuned automatically. In contrast, the simplest reference method uses 4 types of descriptors to which 6 functionals are applied, resulting in over 20 parameters to be tuned.

近来已经提出了几种方法来分析语音并自动推断说话者的个性。这些方法通常依赖于使用现成的工具箱提取的韵律和其他手工制作的语音处理特征。为了实现高精度，通常使用复杂且高度参数化的算法提取大量特征。本文提出了一种基于特征学习和谱图分析的新方法，在保持高精度的同时简化了特征提取过程。所提出的方法从训练语音片段的频谱图表示中提取的块中学习判别特征的字典。然后使用字典对每个语音段进行编码，并使用得到的特征集来执行人格特征的分类。实验表明，与最新的参考方法相比，所提出的方法实现了最新的结果，复杂度显着降低。与特征提取过程相关的特征数量和难度大大减少，因为只使用一种类型的描述符，其中6个参数可以自动调整。相反，最简单的参考方法使用4种类型的描述符，其中应用了6个函数，导致超过20个要调整的参数。
