##### Abstract
The research on multi-object tracking (MOT) is essentially to solve for the data association assignment, the core of which is to design the association cost as discriminative as possible. Generally speaking, the match ambiguities caused by similar appearances of objects and the moving cameras make the data association perplexing and challenging. In this paper, we propose a new heuristic method to search for structural constraints (HSSC) of multiple targets when solving the problem of online multi-object tracking. We believe that the internal structure among multiple targets in the adjacent frames could remain constant and stable even though the video sequences are captured by a moving camera. As a result, the structural constraints are able to cut down the match ambiguities caused by the moving cameras as well as similar appearances of the tracked objects. The proposed heuristic method aims to obtain a maximum match set under the minimum structural cost for each available match pair, which can be integrated with the raw association costs and make them more elaborate and discriminative compared with other approaches. In addition, this paper presents a new method to recover missing targets by minimizing the cost function generated from both motion and structure cues. Our online multi-object tracking (MOT) algorithm based on HSSC has achieved the multi-object tracking accuracy (MOTA) of 25.0 on the public dataset 2DMOT2015[1].

对多目标跟踪（MOT）的研究基本上是为了解决数据关联分配问题，其核心是尽可能区分关联成本。一般来说，由于物体和移动摄像机的相似外观造成的匹配模糊，使得数据关联令人困惑和具有挑战性。在本文中，我们提出了一种新的启发式方法来解决多目标在线多目标跟踪问题的结构约束（HSSC）。我们认为，即使视频序列被移动摄像机捕获，相邻帧中的多个目标之间的内部结构也可以保持恒定和稳定。结果，结构限制能够减少移动相机引起的匹配模糊以及被跟踪物体的相似外观。所提出的启发式方法旨在获得每个可用匹配对的最小结构成本下的最大匹配集，这可以与原始关联成本相结合，并使得它们与其他方法相比更加精细和可区分。另外，本文提出了一种通过最小化运动和结构线索产生的成本函数来恢复失踪目标的新方法。我们基于HSSC的在线多目标跟踪（MOT）算法在公开数据集2DMOT2015上实现了25.0的多目标跟踪精度（MOTA）[1]。
