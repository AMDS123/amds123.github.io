##### Abstract
In this paper, we address the basic problem of recognizing moving objects in video images using SP Theory of Intelligence. The concept of SP Theory of Intelligence which is a framework of artificial intelligence, was first introduced by Gerard J Wolff, where S stands for Simplicity and P stands for Power. Using the concept of multiple alignment, we detect and recognize object of our interest in video frames with multilevel hierarchical parts and subparts, based on polythetic categories. We track the recognized objects using the species based Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO). First, we extract the multiple alignment of our object of interest from training images. In order to recognize accurately and handle occlusion, we use the polythetic concepts on raw data line to omit the redundant noise via searching for best alignment representing the features from the extracted alignments. We recognize the domain of interest from the video scenes in form of wide variety of multiple alignments to handle scene variability. Unsupervised learning is done in the SP model following the DONSVIC principle and natural structures are discovered via information compression and pattern analysis. After successful recognition of objects, we use species based PSO algorithm as the alignments of our object of interest is analogues to observation likelihood and fitness ability of species. Subsequently, we analyze the competition and repulsion among species with annealed Gaussian based PSO. We have tested our algorithms on David, Walking2, FaceOcc1, Jogging and Dudek, obtaining very satisfactory and competitive results.

在本文中，我们使用SP理论来解决在视频图像中识别运动物体的基本问题。智能SP理论是一个人工智能的框架，由Gerard J Wolff首先提出，其中S代表简单性，P代表Power。使用多重对齐的概念，我们基于多义类别，检测并识别我们感兴趣的对象，具有多级分层部分和子部分的视频帧。我们使用基于种群的粒子群优化（PSO）跟踪识别的对象。首先，我们从训练图像中提取感兴趣对象的多重对齐。为了准确识别和处理遮挡，我们使用原始数据行上的多义概念，通过从提取的对齐中搜索表示特征的最佳对齐来省略冗余噪声。我们从各种多重对齐的视频场景中识别感兴趣的领域来处理场景变化。 SP模型中遵循DONSVIC原则进行无监督学习，通过信息压缩和模式分析发现自然结构。在成功识别物体之后，我们使用基于物种的PSO算法，因为我们感兴趣的物体的对准类似于物种的观测可能性和适应能力。随后，我们分析退火高斯粒子群之间的竞争和排斥。我们已经在David，Walking2，FaceOcc1，Jogging和Dudek上测试了我们的算法，获得了非常令人满意的结果。
