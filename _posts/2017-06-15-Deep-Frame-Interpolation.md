##### Abstract
This work presents a supervised learning based approach to the computer vision problem of frame interpolation. The presented technique could also be used in the cartoon animations since drawing each individual frame consumes a noticeable amount of time. The most existing solutions to this problem use unsupervised methods and focus only on real life videos with already high frame rate. However, the experiments show that such methods do not work as well when the frame rate becomes low and object displacements between frames becomes large. This is due to the fact that interpolation of the large displacement motion requires knowledge of the motion structure thus the simple techniques such as frame averaging start to fail. In this work the deep convolutional neural network is used to solve the frame interpolation problem. In addition, it is shown that incorporating the prior information such as optical flow improves the interpolation quality significantly.

本文提出了一种基于监督学习的方法来处理帧插值的计算机视觉问题。提出的技术也可以用在卡通动画中，因为绘制每个单独的帧消耗了大量的时间。这个问题的最现有的解决方案使用无监督的方法，并只关注具有高帧率的现实生活视频。然而，实验表明，当帧速率变低并且帧之间的目标位移变大时，这种方法不能很好地工作。这是由于大位移运动的插值需要运动结构的知识，因此诸如帧平均的简单技术开始失败。在这项工作中，深卷积神经网络被用来解决帧插值问题。另外，表明结合光流等先验信息显着提高了插值质量。
