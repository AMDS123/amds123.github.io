##### Abstract
Previously, we proposed a physically-inspired method to construct data points into an effective in-tree (IT) structure, in which the underlying cluster structure in the dataset is well revealed. Although there are some edges in the IT structure requiring to be removed, such undesired edges are generally distinguishable from other edges and thus are easy to be determined. For instance, when the IT structures for the 2-dimensional (2D) datasets are graphically presented, those undesired edges can be easily spotted and interactively determined. However, in practice, there are many datasets that do not lie in the 2D Euclidean space, thus their IT structures cannot be graphically presented. But if we can effectively map those IT structures into a visualized space in which the salient features of those undesired edges are preserved, then the undesired edges in the IT structures can still be visually determined in a visualization environment. Previously, this purpose was reached by our method called IT-map. The outstanding advantage of IT-map is that clusters can still be found even with the so-called crowding problem in the embedding. In this paper, we propose another method, called IT-Dendrogram, to achieve the same goal through an effective combination of the IT structure and the single link hierarchical clustering (SLHC) method. Like IT-map, IT-Dendrogram can also effectively represent the IT structures in a visualization environment, whereas using another form, called the Dendrogram. IT-Dendrogram can serve as another visualization method to determine the undesired edges in the IT structures and thus benefit the IT-based clustering analysis. This was demonstrated on several datasets with different shapes, dimensions, and attributes. Unlike IT-map, IT-Dendrogram can always avoid the crowding problem, which could help users make more reliable cluster analysis in certain problems.

在此之前，我们提出了一种物理启发式的方法，将数据点构建成一个有效的树状结构（IT），其中数据集中的底层聚类结构被很好地揭示。尽管IT结构中有一些边缘需要去除，但是这些不需要的边缘通常可以与其他边缘区分开来，因此很容易确定。例如，当二维（2D）数据集的IT结构以图形方式呈现时，可以容易地发现并交互式地确定那些不期望的边缘。然而实际上，有许多数据集不在二维欧几里德空间，因此它们的IT结构不能被图形表示。但是如果我们可以将这些IT结构有效地映射到一个可视化的空间中，那些不需要的边缘的显着特征被保留下来，那么IT结构中不需要的边缘仍然可以在可视化环境中直观地确定。以前，这个目的是通过我们称为IT-map的方法实现的。 IT映射的突出优点是即使嵌入中存在所谓的拥挤问题仍然可以找到簇。在本文中，我们提出另一种称为IT树状图的方法，通过IT结构和单链路层次聚类（SLHC）方法的有效结合来实现相同的目标。与IT图一样，IT树形图也可以在可视化环境中有效地表示IT结构，而使用另一种称为树形图的形式。 IT-树状图可以作为另一种可视化方法来确定IT结构中不需要的边缘，从而有利于基于IT的聚类分析。这在几个具有不同形状，尺寸和属性的数据集上被证明。与IT图不同，IT树状图总是可以避免拥挤问题，这可以帮助用户在某些问题上进行更可靠的聚类分析。
