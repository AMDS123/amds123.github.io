##### Abstract
This paper introduces our approach to building a robot with communication capability based on the two key features: stochastic neural dynamics and prediction error minimization (PEM). A preliminary experiment with humanoid robots showed that the robot was able to imitate other's action by means of those key features. In addition, we found that some sorts of communicative patterns emerged between two robots in which the robots inferred the intention of another agent behind the sensory observation.
