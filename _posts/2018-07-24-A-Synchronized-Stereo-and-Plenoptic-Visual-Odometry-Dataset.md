##### Abstract
We present a new dataset to evaluate monocular, stereo, and plenoptic camera based visual odometry algorithms. The dataset comprises a set of synchronized image sequences recorded by a micro lens array (MLA) based plenoptic camera and a stereo camera system. For this, the stereo cameras and the plenoptic camera were assembled on a common hand-held platform. All sequences are recorded in a very large loop, where beginning and end show the same scene. Therefore, the tracking accuracy of a visual odometry algorithm can be measured from the drift between beginning and end of the sequence. For both, the plenoptic camera and the stereo system, we supply full intrinsic camera models, as well as vignetting data. The dataset consists of 11 sequences which were recorded in challenging indoor and outdoor scenarios. We present, by way of example, the results achieved by state-of-the-art algorithms.

我们提出了一个新的数据集来评估单眼，立体和全光相机的视觉测距算法。该数据集包括由基于微透镜阵列（MLA）的全光相机和立体相机系统记录的一组同步图像序列。为此，立体相机和全光相机组装在一个共同的手持平台上。所有序列都以非常大的循环记录，其中开始和结束显示相同的场景。因此，可以从序列的开始和结束之间的漂移来测量视觉测距算法的跟踪精度。对于全光相机和立体声系统，我们提供全内置相机模型以及渐晕数据。该数据集由11个序列组成，这些序列记录在具有挑战性的室内和室外场景中。作为示例，我们提出了通过最先进算法实现的结果。
