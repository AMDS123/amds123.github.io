##### Abstract
RX Detector is recognized as the benchmark algorithm for image anomaly detection, however it presents known limitations, namely the dependence over the image following a multivariate Gaussian model, the estimation and inversion of a highly dimensional covariance matrix and the inability to effectively include spatial awareness in its evaluation. In this work a novel graph-based solution to the image anomaly detection problem is proposed; leveraging on the Graph Fourier Transform, we are able to overcome some of RX Detector's limitations while reducing computational cost at the same time. Tests over both hyperspectral and medical images, using both synthetic and real anomalies, prove the proposed technique is able to obtain significant gains over RX Detector performance.

RX检测器被公认为图像异常检测的基准算法，然而它提出了已知的限制，即多元高斯模型之后的图像依赖性，高维协方差矩阵的估计和反演以及无法有效地包括空间感知其评价。在这项工作中，提出了一种新的基于图形的图像异常检测问题的解决方案;利用图傅里叶变换，我们能够克服一些RX检测器的局限性，同时降低计算成本。使用合成和真实异常对高光谱和医学图像进行测试，证明所提出的技术能够获得超过RX检测器性能的显着增益。
