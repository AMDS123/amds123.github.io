##### Abstract
Accurate and fast identification of seed cultivars is crucial to plant breeding, with accelerating breeding of new products and increasing its quality. In our study, the first attempt to design a high-accurate identification model of maize haploid seeds from diploid ones based on optimum waveband selection of the LSTM-CNN algorithm is realized via deep learning and hyperspectral imaging technology, with accuracy reaching 97% in the determining optimum waveband of 1367.6-1526.4nm. The verification of testing another cultivar achieved an accuracy of 93% in the same waveband. The model collected images of 256 wavebands of seeds in the spectral region of 862.9-1704.2nm. The high-noise waveband intervals were found and deleted by the LSTM. The optimum-data waveband intervals were determined by CNN's waveband-based detection. The optimum sample set for network training only accounted for 1/5 of total sample data. The accuracy was significantly higher than the full-waveband modeling or modeling of any other wavebands. Our study demonstrates that the proposed model has outstanding effect on maize haploid identification and it could be generalized to some extent.

准确快速地鉴定种子品种对于植物育种至关重要，加快新品种繁育和提高品质。在我们的研究中，首次尝试通过深度学习和高光谱成像技术，基于LSTM-CNN算法的最佳波段选择，设计一个二倍体玉米单倍体种子的高精度鉴定模型，准确率达到97％确定1367.6-1526.4nm的最佳波段。在同一波段测试另一品种的验证达到了93％的准确度。该模型采集了862.9-1704.2nm谱区的256个波段种子图像。高噪声波段间隔被LSTM发现并删除。最佳数据波段间隔由CNN基于波段的检测确定。网络训练的最佳样本组仅占总样本数据的1/5。其准确度明显高于任何其他波段的全波段建模或建模。我们的研究表明，该模型对玉米单倍体的鉴定具有显着的效果，可以在一定程度上推广。
