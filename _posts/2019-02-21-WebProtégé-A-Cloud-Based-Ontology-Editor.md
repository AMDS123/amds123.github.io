##### Abstract
We present the WebProtégé application to develop ontologies represented in the Web Ontology Language (OWL). WebProtégé is a cloud-based application that allows users to collaboratively edit OWL ontologies, and it is available for use at this https URL. WebProtégé currently hosts more than 66,000 OWL ontology projects and has over 50,000 user accounts. In this paper, we detail the main new features of the latest version of WebProtégé.
