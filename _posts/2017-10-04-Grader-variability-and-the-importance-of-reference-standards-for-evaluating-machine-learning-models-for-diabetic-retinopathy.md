##### Abstract
Diabetic retinopathy (DR) and diabetic macular edema are common complications of diabetes which can lead to vision loss. The grading of DR is a fairly complex process that requires the detection of fine features such as microaneurysms, intraretinal hemorrhages, and intraretinal microvascular abnormalities. Because of this, there can be a fair amount of grader variability. There are different methods of obtaining the reference standard and resolving disagreements between graders, and while it is usually accepted that adjudication until full consensus will yield the best reference standard, the difference between various methods of resolving disagreements has not been examined extensively. In this study, we examine the variability in different methods of grading, definitions of reference standards, and their effects on building deep learning models for the detection of diabetic eye disease. We find that a small set of adjudicated DR grades allows substantial improvements in algorithm performance. The resulting algorithm's performance was on par with that of individual U.S. board-certified ophthalmologists and retinal specialists.

糖尿病视网膜病变（DR）和糖尿病性黄斑水肿是糖尿病常见的并发症，可导致视力下降。 DR的分级是相当复杂的过程，需要检测诸如微动脉瘤，视网膜内出血和视网膜内微血管异常等优良特征。正因为如此，可以有相当数量的分级变化。获取参考标准和解决分级人员之间的分歧的方法不尽相同，人们通常认为，直到完全达成共识才能产生最好的参考标准，但各种解决分歧的方法之间的差异还没有得到广泛的研究。在这项研究中，我们考察了不同分级方法的变异性，参考标准的定义以及它们对建立糖尿病眼病检测深度学习模型的影响。我们发现一小部分判定的DR等级可以在算法性能上有显着的改进。由此产生的算法的性能与个人美国董事会认证的眼科医生和视网膜专家的性能相当。
