##### Abstract
RoboCup SSL is an excellent platform for researching artificial intelligence and robotics. The dribbling system is an essential issue, which is the main part for completing advanced soccer skills such as trapping and dribbling. In this paper, we designed a new dribbling system for SSL robots, including mechatronics design and control algorithms. For the mechatronics design, we analysed and exposed the 3-touch-point model with the simulation in ADAMS. In the motor controller algorithm, we use reinforcement learning to control the torque output. Finally we verified the results on the robot.
