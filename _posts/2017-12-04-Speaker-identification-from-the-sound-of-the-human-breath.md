##### Abstract
This paper examines the speaker identification potential of breath sounds in continuous speech. Speech is largely produced during exhalation. In order to replenish air in the lungs, speakers must periodically inhale. When inhalation occurs in the midst of continuous speech, it is generally through the mouth. Intra-speech breathing behavior has been the subject of much study, including the patterns, cadence, and variations in energy levels. However, an often ignored characteristic is the {\em sound} produced during the inhalation phase of this cycle. Intra-speech inhalation is rapid and energetic, performed with open mouth and glottis, effectively exposing the entire vocal tract to enable maximum intake of air. This results in vocal tract resonances evoked by turbulence that are characteristic of the speaker's speech-producing apparatus. Consequently, the sounds of inhalation are expected to carry information about the speaker's identity. Moreover, unlike other spoken sounds which are subject to active control, inhalation sounds are generally more natural and less affected by voluntary influences. The goal of this paper is to demonstrate that breath sounds are indeed bio-signatures that can be used to identify speakers. We show that these sounds by themselves can yield remarkably accurate speaker recognition with appropriate feature representations and classification frameworks.

本文考察了连续语音中呼吸音的说话人识别潜力。讲话在呼气时大量产生。为了补充肺部的空气，扬声器必须定期吸气。当在持续言语中发生吸入时，一般是通过口腔吸入。言语内呼吸行为一直是许多研究的主题，包括模式，节奏和能量变化。然而，这个循环的吸气阶段产生的一个经常被忽略的特征是{\ em声音}。语音内吸入迅速且充满活力，以开放的嘴和声门进行，有效地暴露整个声道以使空气最大化。这导致由说话者的语音产生装置的特征的湍流引起的声道共振。因此，吸入声音预计会带有关于说话者身份的信息。而且，不同于受主动控制的其他口语声音，吸入声音通常更自然，并且受自愿影响的影响较小。本文的目的是证明呼吸音确实是可用于识别说话者的生物特征。我们表明，这些声音本身可以产生非常准确的说话人识别与适当的特征表示和分类框架。
