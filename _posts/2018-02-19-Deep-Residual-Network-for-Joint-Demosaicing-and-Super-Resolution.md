##### Abstract
In digital photography, two image restoration tasks have been studied extensively and resolved independently: demosaicing and super-resolution. Both these tasks are related to resolution limitations of the camera. Performing super-resolution on a demosaiced images simply exacerbates the artifacts introduced by demosaicing. In this paper, we show that such accumulation of errors can be easily averted by jointly performing demosaicing and super-resolution. To this end, we propose a deep residual network for learning an end-to-end mapping between Bayer images and high-resolution images. By training on high-quality samples, our deep residual demosaicing and super-resolution network is able to recover high-quality super-resolved images from low-resolution Bayer mosaics in a single step without producing the artifacts common to such processing when the two operations are done separately. We perform extensive experiments to show that our deep residual network achieves demosaiced and super-resolved images that are superior to the state-of-the-art both qualitatively and in terms of PSNR and SSIM metrics.

在数码摄影中，两项图像恢复任务已经得到广泛研究并得到独立解决：去马赛克和超分辨率。这两项任务都与相机的分辨率限制有关。在去马赛克图像上执行超分辨率只会加剧去马赛克引入的伪影。在本文中，我们表明，通过联合执行去马赛克和超分辨率，可以轻松避免这种积累的错误。为此，我们提出了一个深度残差网络，用于学习拜耳图像和高分辨率图像之间的端到端映射。通过对高质量样品进行培训，我们的深度残差去马赛克和超分辨率网络能够在一个步骤中从低分辨率拜耳马赛克中恢复出高质量的超分辨率图像，而不会产生两种操作时常见的伪影分开完成。我们进行大量实验，证明我们的深度残差网络能够实现从质量和PSNR和SSIM指标方面优于最新技术的去马赛克和超分辨图像。
