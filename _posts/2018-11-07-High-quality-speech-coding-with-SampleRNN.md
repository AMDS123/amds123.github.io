##### Abstract
We provide a speech coding scheme employing a generative model based on SampleRNN that, while operating at significantly lower bitrates, matches or surpasses the perceptual quality of state-of-the-art classic wide-band codecs. Moreover, it is demonstrated that the proposed scheme can provide a meaningful rate-distortion trade-off without retraining. We evaluate the proposed scheme in a series of listening tests and discuss limitations of the approach.
