##### Abstract
This paper presents design and experimental evaluations of an articulated robotic limb called Capler-Leg. The key element of Capler-Leg is its single-stage cable-pulley transmission combined with a high-gap radius motor. Our cable-pulley system is designed to be as light-weight as possible and to additionally serve as the primary cooling element, thus significantly increasing the power density and efficiency of the overall system. The total weight of active elements on the leg, i.e. the stators and the rotors, contribute more than 60% of the total leg weight, which is an order of magnitude higher than most existing robots. The resulting robotic leg has low inertia, high torque transparency, low manufacturing cost, no backlash, and a low number of parts. Capler-Leg system itself, serves as an experimental setup for evaluating the proposed cable- pulley design in terms of robustness and efficiency. A continuous jump experiment shows a remarkable 96.5 % recuperation rate, measured at the battery output. This means that almost all the mechanical energy output used during push-off returned back to the battery during touch-down.

本文介绍了一种称为Capler-Leg的铰接机器人肢体的设计和实验评估。 Capler-Leg的关键元素是其单级缆索滑轮变速箱和高间隙半径电机。我们的缆绳滑轮系统设计为尽可能轻便，并且可以作为主要冷却元件，从而显着提高整个系统的功率密度和效率。腿上的有源元件，即定子和转子的总重量占总腿部重量的60％以上，这比大多数现有机器人高出一个数量级。由此产生的机器人腿具有低惯性，高转矩透明度，低制造成本，无间隙以及零件数量少。 Capler-Leg系统本身就是一个实验装置，用于评估所提出的缆索滑轮设计的鲁棒性和效率。连续跳跃实验表明，在电池输出时测得的恢复率显着高达96.5％。这意味着几乎所有在推出过程中使用的机械能输出在接地过程中都会返回到电池。
