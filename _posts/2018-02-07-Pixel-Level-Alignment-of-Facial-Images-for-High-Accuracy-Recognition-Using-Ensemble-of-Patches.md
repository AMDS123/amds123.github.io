##### Abstract
The variation of pose, illumination and expression makes face recognition still a challenging problem. As a pre-processing in holistic approaches, faces are usually aligned by eyes. The proposed method tries to perform a pixel alignment rather than eye-alignment by mapping the geometry of faces to a reference face while keeping their own textures. The proposed geometry alignment not only creates a meaningful correspondence among every pixel of all faces, but also removes expression and pose variations effectively. The geometry alignment is performed pixel-wise, i.e., every pixel of the face is corresponded to a pixel of the reference face. In the proposed method, the information of intensity and geometry of faces are separated properly, trained by separate classifiers, and finally fused together to recognize human faces. Experimental results show a great improvement using the proposed method in comparison to eye-aligned recognition. For instance, at the false acceptance rate of 0.001, the recognition rates are respectively improved by 24% and 33% in Yale and AT&T datasets. In LFW dataset, which is a challenging big dataset, improvement is 20% at FAR of 0.1.

姿态，照度和表情的变化使得人脸识别仍然是一个具有挑战性的问题。作为整体方法的预处理，通常通过眼睛对齐面部。所提出的方法试图通过将面的几何图形映射到参考面来执行像素对准而不是眼对准，同时保持它们自己的纹理。所提出的几何对齐不仅在所有面的每个像素之间创建有意义的对应关系，而且有效地消除了表情和姿态变化。几何对准是以像素为单位进行的，即，脸部的每个像素都对应于参考脸部的像素。在所提出的方法中，人脸的强度和几何信息被恰当地分离，由不同的分类器进行训练，最后融合在一起识别人脸。实验结果表明，与眼对准识别相比，使用所提出的方法有了很大的改进。例如，在错误接受率为0.001的情况下，耶鲁和AT＆T数据集的识别率分别提高了24％和33％。在LFW数据集中，这是一个具有挑战性的大数据集，在FAR为0.1时，改进为20％。
