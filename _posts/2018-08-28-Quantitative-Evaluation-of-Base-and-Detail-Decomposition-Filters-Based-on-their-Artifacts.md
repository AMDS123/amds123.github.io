##### Abstract
This paper introduces a quantitative evaluation of filters that seek to separate an image into its large-scale variations, the base layer, and its fine-scale variations, the detail layer. Such methods have proliferated with the development of HDR imaging and the proposition of many new tone-mapping operators. We argue that an objective quality measurement for all methods can be based on their artifacts. To this aim, the four main recurrent artifacts are described and mathematically characterized. Among them two are classic, the luminance halo and the staircase effect, but we show the relevance of two more, the contrast halo and the compartmentalization effect. For each of these artifacts we design a test-pattern and its attached measurement formula. Then we fuse these measurements into a single quality mark, and obtain in that way a ranking method valid for all filters performing a base+detail decomposition. This synthetic ranking is applied to seven filters representative of the literature and shown to agree with expert artifact rejection criteria.

本文介绍了一种过滤器的定量评估，该过滤器旨在将图像分成大尺度变化，基础层及其精细尺度变化，即细节层。随着HDR成像的发展和许多新的色调映射算子的提出，这些方法已经激增。我们认为所有方法的客观质量测量可以基于它们的工件。为此目的，描述了四种主要的复现伪像并在数学上进行了表征。其中两个是经典的，亮度晕和阶梯效应，但我们展示了两个的相关性，对比光晕和分隔效果。对于这些工件中的每一个，我们设计了测试图案及其附加的测量公式。然后，我们将这些测量值融合到单个质量标记中，并以这种方式获得对执行基本+细节分解的所有滤波器有效的排序方法。该合成排名应用于代表文献的七个过滤器，并且显示出与专家伪影拒绝标准一致。
