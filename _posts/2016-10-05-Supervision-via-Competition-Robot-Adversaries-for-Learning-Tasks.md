##### Abstract
There has been a recent paradigm shift in robotics to data-driven learning for planning and control. Due to large number of experiences required for training, most of these approaches use a self-supervised paradigm: using sensors to measure success/failure. However, in most cases, these sensors provide weak supervision at best. In this work, we propose an adversarial learning framework that pits an adversary against the robot learning the task. In an effort to defeat the adversary, the original robot learns to perform the task with more robustness leading to overall improved performance. We show that this adversarial framework forces the the robot to learn a better grasping model in order to overcome the adversary. By grasping 82% of presented novel objects compared to 68% without an adversary, we demonstrate the utility of creating adversaries. We also demonstrate via experiments that having robots in adversarial setting might be a better learning strategy as compared to having collaborative multiple robots.

机器人学最近发生了一个范式转变，即数据驱动的学习计划和控制。由于培训所需的大量经验，这些方法大多使用自我监督的范例：使用传感器来衡量成功/失败。但是，在大多数情况下，这些传感器最多只能提供较弱的监视。在这项工作中，我们提出了一个敌对的学习框架，使对手机器人学习任务。为了击败对手，原来的机器人学习执行更具鲁棒性的任务，导致整体性能的提高。我们表明，这种对抗框架迫使机器人学习一个更好的抓模型，以克服对手。通过把握所提出的新对象的82％而不是对手的68％，我们证明了创造对手的效用。我们还通过实验证明，与具有协作的多个机器人相比，具有对抗设置的机器人可能是更好的学习策略。
