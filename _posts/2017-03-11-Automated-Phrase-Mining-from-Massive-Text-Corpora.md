##### Abstract
As one of the fundamental tasks in text analysis, phrase mining aims at extracting quality phrases from a text corpus. Phrase mining is important in various tasks such as information extraction/retrieval, taxonomy construction, and topic modeling. Most existing methods rely on complex, trained linguistic analyzers, and thus likely have unsatisfactory performance on text corpora of new domains and genres without extra but expensive adaption. Recently, a few data-driven methods have been developed successfully for extraction of phrases from massive domain-specific text. However, none of the state-of-the-art models is fully automated because they require human experts for designing rules or labeling phrases. Since one can easily obtain many quality phrases from public knowledge bases to a scale that is much larger than that produced by human experts, in this paper, we propose a novel framework for automated phrase mining, AutoPhrase, which leverages this large amount of high-quality phrases in an effective way and achieves better performance compared to limited human labeled phrases. In addition, we develop a POS-guided phrasal segmentation model, which incorporates the shallow syntactic information in part-of-speech (POS) tags to further enhance the performance, when a POS tagger is available. Note that, AutoPhrase can support any language as long as a general knowledge base (e.g., Wikipedia) in that language is available, while benefiting from, but not requiring, a POS tagger. Compared to the state-of-the-art methods, the new method has shown significant improvements in effectiveness on five real-world datasets across different domains and languages.

作为文本分析的基本任务之一，短语挖掘旨在从文本语料库中提取优质短语。短语挖掘在各种任务中很重要，例如信息提取/检索，分类建构和主题建模。大多数现有的方法依赖于复杂的，训练有素的语言分析器，因此在新的领域和流派的文本语料上可能具有不令人满意的性能，而没有额外但昂贵的适应。最近，一些数据驱动的方法已经成功地从海量特定领域的文本中提取短语。然而，没有一个最先进的模型是完全自动化的，因为他们需要人类专家来设计规则或标注短语。由于人们可以很容易地从公共知识库中获取许多优质的短语，其规模比人类专家所产生的要大得多，本文提出了一种新的自动短语挖掘框架AutoPhrase，高质量的短语，并且与有限的人类标记的短语相比，实现了更好的表现。此外，我们还开发了一个POS引导的短语分词模型，该模型在词性标注（POS）标签中包含浅层句法信息，以便在POS标注器可用时进一步提高性能。请注意，只要使用该语言的常规知识库（例如维基百科），AutoPhrase就可以支持任何语言，而受益于但不要求POS标记器。与最先进的方法相比，新方法在不同领域和语言的五个实际数据集的有效性方面显示出显着的提高。
