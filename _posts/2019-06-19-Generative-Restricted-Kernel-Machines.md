##### Abstract
We propose a novel method for estimating generative models based on the Restricted Kernel Machine (RKM) framework. This mechanism uses the shared representation of data from various sources where training only involves solving an eigenvalue problem. By defining an explicit feature map, we show that neural networks could be incorporated in the current framework. Experiments on various datasets demonstrate the potential of the model through qualitative evaluation of generated samples.
