##### Abstract
The aim is to explore new opportunities of the pitch organization of the musical scale. Specifically, a numerical comparison of the different musical temperaments among themselves in the degree of approximation of the Pythagorean scale is provided, and thus it numerically substantiates the thesis that the 53-tone tempered system is the most advanced among possible others. We present numerical data on the approximation of overtones from first twenty by steps of the 53-tone temperament. Here were proposed some schemes of the three-manual keyboard for the implementation of 53-tone temperament, which are also implemented at the same time for 12 -, 17 -, 24 -, 29 - and 41-sounding system. If there are technical means then these schemes can be used to play music in any temperaments, based on said number of steps.

目的是探索音阶组织的新机遇。具体来说，提供了毕达哥拉斯尺度的近似度之间的不同音乐气质的数值比较，从而在数值上证实了53度调和系统是其中最先进的论点。我们提供数值数据的第二十三个泛音的近似值的53阶色调的气质。这里提出了一些用于实现53音调气质的三手动键盘的方案，同时也为12,17,24,29和41音响系统实施。如果有技术手段，那么根据所述步数，这些方案可以用于以任何气质播放音乐。
