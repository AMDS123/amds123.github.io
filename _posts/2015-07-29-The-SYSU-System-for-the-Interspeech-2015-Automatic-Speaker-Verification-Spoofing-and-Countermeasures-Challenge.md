##### Abstract
Many existing speaker verification systems are reported to be vulnerable against different spoofing attacks, for example speaker-adapted speech synthesis, voice conversion, play back, etc. In order to detect these spoofed speech signals as a countermeasure, we propose a score level fusion approach with several different i-vector subsystems. We show that the acoustic level Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCC) features, the phase level modified group delay cepstral coefficients (MGDCC) and the phonetic level phoneme posterior probability (PPP) tandem features are effective for the countermeasure. Furthermore, feature level fusion of these features before i-vector modeling also enhance the performance. A polynomial kernel support vector machine is adopted as the supervised classifier. In order to enhance the generalizability of the countermeasure, we also adopted the cosine similarity and PLDA scoring as one-class classifications methods. By combining the proposed i-vector subsystems with the OpenSMILE baseline which covers the acoustic and prosodic information further improves the final performance. The proposed fusion system achieves 0.29% and 3.26% EER on the development and test set of the database provided by the INTERSPEECH 2015 automatic speaker verification spoofing and countermeasures challenge.

据报道，许多现有的说话者验证系统容易受到不同的欺骗攻击，例如说话者自适应的语音合成，语音转换，回放等。为了检测这些欺骗的语音信号作为对策，我们提出了分数级融合方法与几个不同的i矢量子系统。我们发现声级美尔频率倒谱系数（MFCC）特征，相位级修正群延迟倒谱系数（MGDCC）和语音级音素后验概率（PPP）串联特征对于对策是有效的。此外，在i矢量建模之前，这些特征的特征级融合也提高了性能。采用多项式核支持向量机作为监督分类器。为了提高对策的普遍性，我们也采用余弦相似度和PLDA评分作为一级分类方法。通过将提出的i矢量子系统与涵盖声学和韵律信息的OpenSMILE基线相结合，进一步提高了最终性能。所提出的融合系统在INTERSPEECH 2015自动说话人验证欺骗和对策挑战提供的数据库开发和测试集上达到了0.29％和3.26％的EER。
