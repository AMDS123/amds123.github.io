##### Abstract
Biomedical word sense disambiguation (WSD) is an important intermediate task in many natural language processing applications such as named entity recognition, syntactic parsing, and relation extraction. In this paper, we employ knowledge-based approaches that also exploit recent advances in neural word/concept embeddings to improve over the state-of-the-art in biomedical WSD using the MSH WSD dataset as the test set. Our methods involve weak supervision - we do not use any hand-labeled examples for WSD to build our prediction models; however, we employ an existing well known named entity recognition and concept mapping program, MetaMap, to obtain our concept vectors. Over the MSH WSD dataset, our linear time (in terms of numbers of senses and words in the test instance) method achieves an accuracy of 92.24% which is an absolute 3% improvement over the best known results obtained via unsupervised or knowledge-based means. A more expensive approach that we developed relies on a nearest neighbor framework and achieves an accuracy of 94.34%. Employing dense vector representations learned from unlabeled free text has been shown to benefit many language processing tasks recently and our efforts show that biomedical WSD is no exception to this trend. For a complex and rapidly evolving domain such as biomedicine, building labeled datasets for larger sets of ambiguous terms may be impractical. Here, we show that weak supervision that leverages recent advances in representation learning can rival supervised approaches in biomedical WSD. However, external knowledge bases (here sense inventories) play a key role in the improvements achieved.

生物医学词义消歧（WSD）是许多自然语言处理应用中的重要中间任务，如命名实体识别，句法分析和关系提取。在本文中，我们采用基于知识的方法，利用神经词汇/概念嵌入的最新进展，以MSH WSD数据集作为测试集，改进生物医学WSD的最新技术。我们的方法涉及弱监督 - 我们不使用任何手动标记的例子来建立我们的预测模型;然而，我们使用一个已知的命名实体识别和概念映射程序MetaMap来获得我们的概念向量。在MSH WSD数据集上，我们的线性时间（根据测试实例中感官和词汇的数量）的方法达到了92.24％的精确度，这比绝大多数通过无监督或基于知识的手段。我们开发的更昂贵的方法依赖于最近邻框架，并且达到94.34％的准确度。从未标记的自由文本中学习密集的向量表示已被证明最近有益于许多语言处理任务，而且我们的努力表明，生物医学WSD也不例外。对于像生物医学这样一个复杂且快速发展的领域，为更大的模糊术语集建立标记数据集可能是不切实际的。在这里，我们表明，利用代表性学习近期进展的弱监督可以与生物医学WSD中的监督方法相媲美。但是，外部知识库（这里是指库存）在所取得的改进中起着关键作用。
