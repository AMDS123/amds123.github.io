##### Abstract
We present a novel semantic framework for modeling linguistic expressions of generalization - generic, habitual, and episodic statements - as combinations of simple, real-valued referential properties of predicates and their arguments. We use this framework to construct a dataset covering the entirety of the Universal Dependencies English Web Treebank. We use this dataset to probe the efficacy of type-level and token-level information - including hand-engineered features and contextual and non-contextual word embeddings - for predicting expressions of generalization. Data and code are available at decomp.io.
