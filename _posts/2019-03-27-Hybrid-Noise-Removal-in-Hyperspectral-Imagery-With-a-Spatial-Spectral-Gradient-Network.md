##### Abstract
The existence of hybrid noise in hyperspectral images (HSIs) severely degrades the data quality, reduces the interpretation accuracy of HSIs, and restricts the subsequent HSIs applications. In this paper, the spatial-spectral gradient network (SSGN) is presented for mixed noise removal in HSIs. The proposed method employs a spatial-spectral gradient learning strategy, in consideration of the unique spatial structure directionality of sparse noise and spectral differences with additional complementary information for better extracting intrinsic and deep features of HSIs. Based on a fully cascaded multi-scale convolutional network, SSGN can simultaneously deal with the different types of noise in different HSIs or spectra by the use of the same model. The simulated and real-data experiments undertaken in this study confirmed that the proposed SSGN performs better at mixed noise removal than the other state-of-the-art HSI denoising algorithms, in evaluation indices, visual assessments, and time consumption.
