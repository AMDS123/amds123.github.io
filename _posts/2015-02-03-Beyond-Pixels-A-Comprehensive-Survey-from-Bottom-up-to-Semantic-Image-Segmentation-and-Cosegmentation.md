##### Abstract
Image segmentation refers to the process to divide an image into nonoverlapping meaningful regions according to human perception, which has become a classic topic since the early ages of computer vision. A lot of research has been conducted and has resulted in many applications. However, while many segmentation algorithms exist, yet there are only a few sparse and outdated summarizations available, an overview of the recent achievements and issues is lacking. We aim to provide a comprehensive review of the recent progress in this field. Covering 180 publications, we give an overview of broad areas of segmentation topics including not only the classic bottom-up approaches, but also the recent development in superpixel, interactive methods, object proposals, semantic image parsing and image cosegmentation. In addition, we also review the existing influential datasets and evaluation metrics. Finally, we suggest some design flavors and research directions for future research in image segmentation.

##### Abstract (translated by Google)
图像分割是指根据人类感知将图像划分为不重叠的有意义区域的过程，这已经成为计算机视觉早期的一个经典话题。大量的研究已经进行，并导致了许​​多应用。然而，虽然有许多分割算法存在，但只有少量稀少和过时的总结，缺乏近期成果和问题的概述。我们的目标是全面回顾这个领域的最新进展。涵盖180个出版物，我们概述了分割主题的广泛领域，不仅包括经典的自下而上的方法，而且还包括最近在超像素，交互方法，对象提议，语义图像分析和图像分割方面的发展。另外，我们还回顾了现有的有影响力的数据集和评估指标。最后，针对未来的图像分割研究，提出一些设计风格和研究方向。
