##### Abstract
Search is a prominent channel for discovering products on an e-commerce platform. Ranking products retrieved from search becomes crucial to address customer's need and optimize for business metrics. While learning to Rank (LETOR) models have been extensively studied and have demonstrated efficacy in the context of web search; it is a relatively new research area to be explored in the e-commerce. 
 In this paper, we present a framework for building LETOR model for an e-commerce platform. We analyze user queries and propose a mechanism to segment queries between broad and narrow based on user's intent. We discuss different types of features - query, product and query-product and discuss challenges in using them. We show that sparsity in product features can be tackled through a denoising auto-encoder while skip-gram based word embeddings help solve the query-product sparsity issues. We also present various target metrics that can be employed for evaluating search results and compare their robustness. 
 Further, we build and compare performances of both pointwise and pairwise LETOR models on fashion category data set. We also build and compare distinct models for broad and narrow queries, analyze feature importance across these and show that these specialized models perform better than a combined model in the fashion world.
