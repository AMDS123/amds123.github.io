##### Abstract
Since the beginning of early civilizations, social relationships derived from each individual fundamentally form the basis of social structure in our daily life. In the computer vision literature, much progress has been made in scene understanding, such as object detection and scene parsing. Recent research focuses on the relationship between objects based on its functionality and geometrical relations. In this work, we aim to study the problem of social relationship recognition, in still images. We have proposed a dual-glance model for social relationship recognition, where the first glance fixates at the individual pair of interest and the second glance deploys attention mechanism to explore contextual cues. We have also collected a new large scale People in Social Context (PISC) dataset, which comprises of 22,670 images and 76,568 annotated samples from 9 types of social relationship. We provide benchmark results on the PISC dataset, and qualitatively demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed model.

早期文明开始以来，每个人的社会关系从根本上构成了我们日常生活中社会结构的基础。在计算机视觉文献中，场景理解已经取得了很大的进展，如对象检测和场景解析。最近的研究集中在基于功能和几何关系的对象之间的关系上。在这项工作中，我们的目标是研究静态图像中的社会关系识别问题。我们提出了一个社会关系认知的双视图模型，第一眼看着个人兴趣对，第二眼看着注意机制探索情境暗示。我们还收集了一个新的大规模的社会背景的人（PISC）数据集，其中包括来自9种社会关系的22,670张图片和76,568份注释样本。我们在PISC数据集上提供基准测试结果，并定性证明所提出模型的有效性。
