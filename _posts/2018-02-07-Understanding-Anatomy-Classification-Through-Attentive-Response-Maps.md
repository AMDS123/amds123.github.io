##### Abstract
One of the main challenges for broad adoption of deep learning based models such as convolutional neural networks (CNN), is the lack of understanding of their decisions. In many applications, a simpler, less capable model that can be easily understood is favorable to a black-box model that has superior performance. In this paper, we present an approach for designing CNNs based on visualization of the internal activations of the model. We visualize the model's response through attentive response maps obtained using a fractional stride convolution technique and compare the results with known imaging landmarks from the medical literature. We show that sufficiently deep and capable models can be successfully trained to use the same medical landmarks a human expert would use. Our approach allows for communicating the model decision process well, but also offers insight towards detecting biases.

广泛采用卷积神经网络（CNN）等基于深度学习的模型面临的主要挑战之一是缺乏对其决策的理解。在许多应用中，更容易理解的更简单，不太能力的模型有利于具有优越性能的黑盒模型。在本文中，我们提出了一种基于模型内部激活的可视化设计CNN的方法。我们通过使用分步跨度卷积技术获得的周密反应图来显现模型的响应，并将结果与​​来自医学文献的已知成像界标进行比较。我们表明，足够深入和有能力的模型可以成功地训练使用人类专家将使用相同的医疗地标。我们的方法可以很好地传达模型决策过程，但也可以提供对检测偏差的洞察力。
