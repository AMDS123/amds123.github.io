##### Abstract
The purpose of this paper is to introduce a set of four test images containing features and structures that can facilitate effective examination and comparison of image processing algorithms. More specifically, the images are designed to more explicitly expose the characteristic properties of algorithms for image compression, virtual resolution adjustment, and enhancement. This set was developed at the Naval Research Laboratory (NRL) in the late 1990s as a more rigorous alternative to Lena and other images that have come into common use for purely ad hoc reasons with little or no rigorous consideration of their suitability. The increasing number of test images appearing in the literature not only makes it more difficult to compare results from different papers, it also introduces the potential for cherry-picking to influence results. The key contribution of this paper is the proposal to establish {\em some} canonical set to ensure that published results can be analyzed and compared in a rigorous way from one paper to another, and consideration of the four NRL images is proposed for this purpose.

##### Abstract (translated by Google)
本文的目的是介绍一组包含特征和结构的测试图像，以便于图像处理算法的有效检查和比较。更具体地说，图像被设计为更明确地暴露用于图像压缩，虚拟分辨率调整和增强的算法的特性。该组是在20世纪90年代后期在海军研究实验室（NRL）开发的，作为对Lena和其他图像的更为严格的替代方案，这些图像由于纯粹的特殊原因而很少或根本没有严格考虑其适用性。文献中出现越来越多的测试图像不仅使得比较不同论文的结果变得更加困难，而且还引入了采摘樱桃以影响结果的可能性。本文的主要贡献是建议建立一些规范集以确保公布的结果能够以严格的方式从一篇论文到另一篇进行分析和比较，并且为此目的提出了对四种NRL图像的考虑。
