##### Abstract
With the recent advances of neural models and natural language processing, automatic generation of classical Chinese poetry has drawn significant attention due to its artistic and cultural value. Previous works mainly focus on generating poetry given keywords or other text information, while visual inspirations for poetry have been rarely explored. Generating poetry from images is much more challenging than generating poetry from text, since images contain very rich visual information which cannot be described completely using several keywords, and a good poem should convey the image accurately. In this paper, we propose a memory based neural model which exploits images to generate poems. Specifically, an Encoder-Decoder model with a topic memory network is proposed to generate classical Chinese poetry from images. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work attempting to generate classical Chinese poetry from images with neural networks. A comprehensive experimental investigation with both human evaluation and quantitative analysis demonstrates that the proposed model can generate poems which convey images accurately.

随着神经模型和自然语言处理技术的进步，中国古典诗歌的自动生成因其艺术和文化价值受到了极大的关注。以前的作品主要集中在为关键词或其他文本信息生成诗歌，而对诗歌的视觉灵感很少被探索。从图像生成诗歌比从文本生成诗歌更具挑战性，因为图像包含非常丰富的视觉信息，不能用几个关键词来完整描述，而好的诗应该能够准确地传达图像。在本文中，我们提出了一种基于记忆的神经模型，它利用图像生成诗歌。具体而言，提出了具有主题记忆网络的编码器 - 解码器模型以从图像生成古典中国诗歌。据我们所知，这是第一部尝试从神经网络图像生成中国古典诗歌的作品。一项包含人类评估和定量分析的全面实验研究表明，所提出的模型可以生成精确传达图像的诗歌。
