##### Abstract
While many models are purposed for detecting the occurrence of significant events in financial systems, the task of providing qualitative detail on the developments is not usually as well automated. We present a deep learning approach for detecting relevant discussion in text and extracting natural language descriptions of events. Supervised by only a small set of event information, comprising entity names and dates, the model is leveraged by unsupervised learning of semantic vector representations on extensive text data. We demonstrate applicability to the study of financial risk based on news (6.6M articles), particularly bank distress and government interventions (243 events), where indices can signal the level of bank-stress-related reporting at the entity level, or aggregated at national or European level, while being coupled with explanations. Thus, we exemplify how text, as timely, widely available and descriptive data, can serve as a useful complementary source of information for financial and systemic risk analytics.

尽管有许多模型用于检测金融系统中重大事件的发生，但提供定性细节的任务通常不是自动化的。我们提出了深入的学习方法来检测文本中的相关讨论，并提取事件的自然语言描述。仅由一小组事件信息（包括实体名称和日期）进行监督，通过在广泛的文本数据上无监督地学习语义向量表示来利用该模型。我们证明了基于新闻（6.6M篇），尤其是银行危机和政府干预（243个事件）的金融风险研究的适用性，其中指标可以指示实体层面的银行压力相关报告的水平，国家或欧洲的水平，同时加上解释。因此，我们举例说明了文本作为及时，广泛可用的描述性数据如何可以作为金融和系统风险分析的有用补充信息来源。
