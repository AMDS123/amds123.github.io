##### Abstract
Making inferences from partial information constitutes a critical aspect of cognition. During visual perception, pattern completion enables recognition of poorly visible or occluded objects. We combined psychophysics, physiology and computational models to test the hypothesis that pattern completion is implemented by recurrent computations and present three pieces of evidence that are consistent with this hypothesis. First, subjects robustly recognized objects even when rendered <10% visible, but recognition was largely impaired when processing was interrupted by backward masking. Second, invasive physiological responses along the human ventral cortex exhibited visually selective responses to partially visible objects that were delayed compared to whole objects, suggesting the need for additional computations. These physiological delays were correlated with the effects of backward masking. Third, state-of-the-art feed-forward computational architectures were not robust to partial visibility. However, recognition performance was recovered when the model was augmented with attractor-based recurrent connectivity. These results provide a strong argument of plausibility for the role of recurrent computations in making visual inferences from partial information.

从部分信息进行推断构成了认知的一个关键方面。在视觉感知期间，图案完成使得能够识别难以看见或被遮挡的物体。我们结合心理物理学，生理学和计算模型来检验模式完成是通过反复计算来实现的假设，并提出了三个与这个假设一致的证据。首先，即使在可见度<10％的情况下，对象仍然具有强大的识别对象，但是当处理被后向遮蔽中断时识别受到很大损害。其次，沿着人类腹侧皮质的侵入性生理反应对部分可见物体的视觉选择性响应表现出与整个物体相比被延迟，表明需要额外的计算。这些生理延迟与后向遮蔽的影响相关。第三，最先进的前馈计算架构对部分可视性不够强健。然而，当模型增加了基于吸引子的经常性连接时，识别性能得到了恢复。这些结果为反复计算在从局部信息进行视觉推断中的作用提供了一个有力的论证。
