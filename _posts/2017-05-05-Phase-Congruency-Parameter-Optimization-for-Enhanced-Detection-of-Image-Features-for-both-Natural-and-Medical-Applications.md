##### Abstract
Following the presentation and proof of the hypothesis that image features are particularly perceived at points where the Fourier components are maximally in phase, the concept of phase congruency (PC) is introduced. Subsequently, a two-dimensional multi-scale phase congruency (2D-MSPC) is developed, which has been an important tool for detecting and evaluation of image features. However, the 2D-MSPC requires many parameters to be appropriately tuned for optimal image features detection. In this paper, we defined a criterion for parameter optimization of the 2D-MSPC, which is a function of its maximum and minimum moments. We formulated the problem in various optimal and suboptimal frameworks, and discussed the conditions and features of the suboptimal solutions. The effectiveness of the proposed method was verified through several examples, ranging from natural objects to medical images from patients with a neurological disease, multiple sclerosis.

在傅立叶分量最大相位点上特别感知图像特征的假设的介绍和证明之后，介绍了相位一致性（PC）的概念。随后，开发了二维多尺度相位一致性（2D-MSPC），该方法一直是图像特征检测和评估的重要工具。然而，2D-MSPC需要很多参数进行适当的调整以获得最佳的图像特征检测。在本文中，我们定义了2D-MSPC参数优化的一个准则，它是最大和最小矩的函数。我们在各种最优和次优框架下制定了这个问题，并讨论了次优解的条件和特点。所提出的方法的有效性通过几个例子来验证，从自然对象到患有神经疾病，多发性硬化的患者的医学图像。
