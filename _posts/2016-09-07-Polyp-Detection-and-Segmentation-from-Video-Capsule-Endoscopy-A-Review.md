##### Abstract
Video capsule endoscopy (VCE) is used widely nowadays for visualizing the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. Capsule endoscopy exams are prescribed usually as an additional monitoring mechanism and can help in identifying polyps, bleeding, etc. To analyze the large scale video data produced by VCE exams automatic image processing, computer vision, and learning algorithms are required. Recently, automatic polyp detection algorithms have been proposed with various degrees of success. Though polyp detection in colonoscopy and other traditional endoscopy procedure based images is becoming a mature field, due to its unique imaging characteristics detecting polyps automatically in VCE is a hard problem. We review different polyp detection approaches for VCE imagery and provide systematic analysis with challenges faced by standard image processing and computer vision methods.

视频胶囊内镜（VCE）如今被广泛用于可视化胃肠（GI）道。胶囊内镜检查通常被规定为额外的监测机制，可以帮助识别息肉，出血等。为了分析由VCE考试产生的大规模视频数据，需要自动图像处理，计算机视觉和学习算法。最近，已经提出了不同程度的成功的自动息肉检测算法。虽然结肠镜检查等传统内镜手术图像的息肉检测正在成为一个成熟的领域，但由于其独特的成像特征，在VCE中自动检测息肉是一个难题。我们回顾了不同的VCE图像息肉检测方法，并提供了系统分析标准图像处理和计算机视觉方法面临的挑战。
