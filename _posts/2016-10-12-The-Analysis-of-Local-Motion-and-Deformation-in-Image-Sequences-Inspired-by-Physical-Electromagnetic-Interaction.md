##### Abstract
In order to analyze the moving and deforming of the objects in image sequence, a novel way is presented to analyze the local changes of object edges between two related images (such as two adjacent frames in a video sequence), which is inspired by the physical electromagnetic interaction. The changes of edge between adjacent frames in sequences are analyzed by simulation of virtual current interaction, which can reflect the change of the object's position or shape. The virtual current along the main edge line is proposed based on the significant edge extraction. Then the virtual interaction between the current elements in the two related images is studied by imitating the interaction between physical current-carrying wires. The experimental results prove that the distribution of magnetic forces on the current elements in one image applied by the other can reflect the local change of edge lines from one image to the other, which is important in further analysis.

为了分析图像序列中物体的运动和变形，提出了一种新的方法来分析两个相关图像（如视频序列中的两个相邻帧）之间物体边缘的局部变化，电磁相互作用通过虚拟电流相互作用的仿真分析了序列中相邻帧之间边缘的变化，可以反映物体位置或形状的变化。基于重要的边缘提取，提出了沿主边线的虚拟电流。然后通过模拟物理载流线之间的相互作用，研究两个相关图像中当前元素之间的虚拟相互作用。实验结果证明，一个图像中的磁场分量可以反映一幅图像中的边缘线的局部变化，这对于进一步的分析是非常重要的。
