##### Abstract
Recently, significant progress has been achieved in deep image matting. Most of the classical image matting methods are time-consuming and require an ideal trimap which is difficult to attain in practice. A high efficient image matting method based on a weakly annotated mask is in demand for mobile applications. In this paper, we propose a novel method based on Deep Learning and Guided Filter, called Inductive Guided Filter, which can tackle the real-time general image matting task on mobile devices. We design a lightweight hourglass network to parameterize the original Guided Filter method that takes an image and a weakly annotated mask as input. Further, the use of Gabor loss is proposed for training networks for complicated textures in image matting. Moreover, we create an image matting dataset MAT-2793 with a variety of foreground objects. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method massively reduces running time with robust accuracy.
