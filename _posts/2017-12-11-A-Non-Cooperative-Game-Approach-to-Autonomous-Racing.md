##### Abstract
We consider autonomous racing of two cars and present an approach to formulate the decision making as a non-cooperative non-zero-sum game. The game is formulated by restricting both players to fulfill static track constraints as well as collision constraints which depend on the combined actions of the two players. At the same time the players try to maximize their own progress. In the case where the action space of the players is finite, the racing game can be reformulated as a bimatrix game. For this bimatrix game, we show that the actions obtained by a sequential maximization approach where only the follower considers the action of the leader are identical to a Stackelberg and a Nash equilibrium in pure strategies. Furthermore, we propose a game promoting blocking, by additionally rewarding the leading car for staying ahead at the end of the horizon. We show that this changes the Stackelberg equilibrium, but has a minor influence on the Nash equilibria. For an online implementation, we propose to play the games in a moving horizon fashion, and we present two methods for guaranteeing feasibility of the resulting coupled repeated games. Finally, we study the performance of the proposed approaches in simulation for a set-up that replicates the miniature race car tested at the Automatic Control Laboratory of ETH Zurich. The simulation study shows that the presented games can successfully model different racing behaviors and generate interesting racing situations.

我们考虑两辆车的自主竞赛，并提出一种将决策制定为非合作非零和博弈的方法。通过限制两个玩家履行静态轨道约束以及取决于两个玩家的组合动作的碰撞限制来制定游戏。与此同时，球员们试图最大化自己的进步。在玩家的动作空间是有限的情况下，赛车游戏可以被重新构造为双矩阵游戏。对于这个双矩阵游戏，我们表明，通过连续最大化方法获得的行动，只有追随者认为领导者的行为，与纯战略中的斯坦克伯格和纳什均衡是一致的。此外，我们提出了一个促进阻塞的比赛，另外奖励领先的赛车在地平线的尽头。我们证明这改变了斯塔克尔伯格的均衡，但对纳什均衡有一个小的影响。对于在线实现，我们提出以移动视界方式来玩游戏，并提出两种方法来保证所产生的耦合重复游戏的可行性。最后，我们研究所提出的方法在模拟仿真中的性能，该仿真复制在苏黎世联邦理工学院的自动控制实验室中测试的微型赛车。仿真研究表明，所提供的游戏可以成功模拟不同的赛车行为，并产生有趣的赛车情况。
