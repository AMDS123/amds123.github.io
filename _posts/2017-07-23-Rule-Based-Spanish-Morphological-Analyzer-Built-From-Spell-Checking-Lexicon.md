##### Abstract
Preprocessing tools for automated text analysis have become more widely available in major languages, but non-English tools are often still limited in their functionality. When working with Spanish-language text, researchers can easily find tools for tokenization and stemming, but may not have the means to extract more complex word features like verb tense or mood. Yet Spanish is a morphologically rich language in which such features are often identifiable from word form. Conjugation rules are consistent, but many special verbs and nouns take on different rules. While building a complete dictionary of known words and their morphological rules would be labor intensive, resources to do so already exist, in spell checkers designed to generate valid forms of known words. This paper introduces a set of tools for Spanish-language morphological analysis, built using the COES spell checking tools, to label person, mood, tense, gender and number, derive a word's root noun or verb infinitive, and convert verbs to their nominal form.

用于自动化文本分析的预处理工具在主要语言中已经变得更加广泛，但是非英语工具的功能通常仍然有限。在使用西班牙语文本时，研究人员可以很容易地找到用于分词和词干的工具，但可能没有办法提取更复杂的单词特征，如动词时态或情绪。然而西班牙语是一种形态丰富的语言，其中这些特征通常可以从单词形式中识别出来。共轭规则是一致的，但许多特殊的动词和名词采取不同的规则。虽然建立一个完整的已知单词字典及其形态规则将是劳动密集型的，但已经存在的资源已经存在，用于生成有效形式的已知单词的拼写检查器。本文介绍了一套用于西班牙语形态分析的工具，使用COES拼写检查工具建立，标注人，情绪，时态，性别和数字，导出单词的根名词或动词不定式，并将动词转换为名词形式。
