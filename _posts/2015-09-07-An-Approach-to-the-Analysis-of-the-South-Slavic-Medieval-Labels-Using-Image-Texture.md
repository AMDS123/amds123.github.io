##### Abstract
The paper presents a new script classification method for the discrimination of the South Slavic medieval labels. It consists in the textural analysis of the script types. In the first step, each letter is coded by the equivalent script type, which is defined by its typographical features. Obtained coded text is subjected to the run-length statistical analysis and to the adjacent local binary pattern analysis in order to extract the features. The result shows a diversity between the extracted features of the scripts, which makes the feature classification more effective. It is the basis for the classification process of the script identification by using an extension of a state-of-the-art approach for document clustering. The proposed method is evaluated on an example of hand-engraved in stone and hand-printed in paper labels in old Cyrillic, angular and round Glagolitic. Experiments demonstrate very positive results, which prove the effectiveness of the proposed method.

##### Abstract (translated by Google)
本文提出了一种新的南斯拉夫中世纪标签分类方法。它包括对脚本类型的纹理分析。在第一步中，每个字母都由等效的脚本类型编码，这是由其排版特征定义的。获得的编码文本受到游程长度统计分析和相邻的本地二进制模式分析以提取特征。结果表明，提取的特征之间的差异，使特征分类更有效。它是文件聚类的最新方法的延伸，是脚本识别分类过程的基础。所提出的方法是在手工雕刻的例子上进行评估的，并以旧西里尔字形，角形和圆形的Glagolitic手工打印在纸质标签上。实验证明了非常好的结果，证明了该方法的有效性。
