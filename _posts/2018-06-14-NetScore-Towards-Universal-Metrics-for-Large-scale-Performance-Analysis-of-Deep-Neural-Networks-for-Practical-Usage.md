##### Abstract
Much of the focus in the design of deep neural networks has been on improving accuracy, leading to more powerful yet highly complex network architectures that are difficult to deploy in practical scenarios, particularly on edge devices such as mobile and other consumer devices, given their high computational and memory requirements. As a result, there has been a recent interest in the design of quantitative metrics for evaluating deep neural networks that accounts for more than just model accuracy as the sole indicator of network performance. In this study, we continue the conversation towards universal metrics for evaluating the performance of deep neural networks for practical usage. In particular, we propose a new balanced metric called NetScore, which is designed specifically to provide a quantitative assessment of the balance between accuracy, computational complexity, and network architecture complexity of a deep neural network. In what is one of the largest comparative analysis between deep neural networks in literature, the NetScore metric, the top-1 accuracy metric, and the popular information density metric were compared across a diverse set of 50 different deep convolutional neural networks for image classification on the ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge (ILSVRC 2012) dataset. The evaluation results across these three metrics for this diverse set of networks are presented in this study to act as a reference guide for practitioners in the field. The proposed NetScore metric, along with the other tested metrics, are by no means perfect, but the hope is to push the conversation towards better universal metrics for evaluating deep neural networks for use in practical scenarios to help guide practitioners in model design.

深度神经网络设计中的许多焦点一直在提高准确性，导致更强大但高度复杂的网络架构难以在实际场景中部署，特别是在诸如移动和其他消费者设备的边缘设备上，因为它们的高计算和内存要求。因此，最近人们对用于评估深度神经网络的量化指标的设计有兴趣，这些指标不仅仅将模型精度作为网络性能的唯一指标。在这项研究中，我们继续讨论通用度量标准，以评估实际使用的深度神经网络的性能。特别是，我们提出了一种新的称为NetScore的平衡度量，它专门用于定量评估深度神经网络的精度，计算复杂度和网络架构复杂度之间的平衡。在文献中深度神经网络之间最大的对比分析之一是NetScore度量，前1精度度量和流行信息密度度量在50种不同的深度卷积神经网络的不同集合上进行比较，用于图像分类ImageNet大规模视觉识别挑战（ILSVRC 2012）数据集。这项研究介绍了这三种不同网络指标的评估结果，以作为该领域从业人员的参考指南。建议的NetScore度量以及其他测试指标并不完美，但希望将对话推向更好的通用度量标准，以评估深度神经网络以用于实际场景，以帮助指导模型设计中的从业人员。
