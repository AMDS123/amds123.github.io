##### Abstract
In recent years, low-rank based tensor completion, which is a higher-order extension of matrix completion, has received considerable attention. However, the low-rank assumption is not sufficient for the recovery of visual data, such as color and 3D images, where the ratio of missing data is extremely high. In this paper, we consider "smoothness" constraints as well as low-rank approximations, and propose an efficient algorithm for performing tensor completion that is particularly powerful regarding visual data. The proposed method admits significant advantages, owing to the integration of smooth PARAFAC decomposition for incomplete tensors and the efficient selection of models in order to minimize the tensor rank. Thus, our proposed method is termed as "smooth PARAFAC tensor completion (SPC)." In order to impose the smoothness constraints, we employ two strategies, total variation (SPC-TV) and quadratic variation (SPC-QV), and invoke the corresponding algorithms for model learning. Extensive experimental evaluations on both synthetic and real-world visual data illustrate the significant improvements of our method, in terms of both prediction performance and efficiency, compared with many state-of-the-art tensor completion methods.

近年来，作为矩阵完成的高阶扩展的基于低秩的张量完成得到了相当的关注。然而，对于缺失数据比例非常高的颜色和3D图像等视觉数据的恢复来说，低秩假设是不够的。在本文中，我们考虑“平滑”约束以及低秩逼近，并提出一个高效的算法来执行对视觉数据特别有效的张量完成。该方法具有显着的优点，因为对不完全张量的光滑PARAFAC分解的整合和模型的有效选择以使张量等级最小化。因此，我们提出的方法被称为“平滑PARAFAC张量完成（SPC）”。为了强加平滑约束，我们采用总变差（SPC-TV）和二次变差（SPC-QV）两种策略，并调用相应的算法进行模型学习。对综合和现实世界的视觉数据进行广泛的实验评估，说明我们的方法在预测性能和效率方面的重大改进，与许多最先进的张量完成方法相比。
