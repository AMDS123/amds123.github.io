##### Abstract
The problem of inpainting involves reconstructing the missing areas of an image. Inpainting has many applications, such as reconstructing old damaged photographs or removing obfuscations from images. In this paper we present the directional diffusion algorithm for inpainting. Typical diffusion algorithms are bad at propagating edges from the image into the unknown masked regions. The directional diffusion algorithm improves on the regular diffusion algorithm by reconstructing edges more accurately. It scores better than regular diffusion when reconstructing images that are obfuscated by a text mask.

修补的问题涉及重建图像的缺失区域。修补有许多应用，如重建旧损坏的照片或从图像中删除混淆。在本文中，我们提出了用于修复的定向扩散算法。典型的扩散算法在从图像传播到未知掩蔽区域的过程中是不好的。定向扩散算法通过更精确地重构边缘来改进规则扩散算法。在重构由文本掩码模糊的图像时，它比常规扩散要好得多。
