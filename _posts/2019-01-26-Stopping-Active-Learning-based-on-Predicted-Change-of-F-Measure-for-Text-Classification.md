##### Abstract
During active learning, an effective stopping method allows users to limit the number of annotations, which is cost effective. In this paper, a new stopping method called Predicted Change of F Measure will be introduced that attempts to provide the users an estimate of how much performance of the model is changing at each iteration. This stopping method can be applied with any base learner. This method is useful for reducing the data annotation bottleneck encountered when building text classification systems.
