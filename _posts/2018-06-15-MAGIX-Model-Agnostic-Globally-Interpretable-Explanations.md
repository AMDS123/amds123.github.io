##### Abstract
Explaining the behavior of a black box machine learning model at the instance level is useful for building trust. However, it is also important to understand how the model behaves globally. Such an understanding provides insight into both the data on which the model was trained and the patterns that it learned. We present here an approach that learns if-then rules to globally explain the behavior of black box machine learning models that have been used to solve classification problems. The approach works by first extracting conditions that were important at the instance level and then evolving rules through a genetic algorithm with an appropriate fitness function. Collectively, these rules represent the patterns followed by the model for decisioning and are useful for understanding its behavior. We demonstrate the validity and usefulness of the approach by interpreting black box models created using publicly available data sets as well as a private digital marketing data set.

在实例级别解释黑盒机器学习模型的行为对建立信任非常有用。但是，了解模型如何在全球范围内行为也很重要。这种理解提供了对模型的训练数据和所学模式的深入了解。我们在这里介绍一种方法，学习if-then规则来全局解释已用于解决分类问题的黑盒机器学习模型的行为。该方法首先提取在实例级重要的条件，然后通过具有适当适应度函数的遗传算法演化规则。总的来说，这些规则代表了决策模型遵循的模式，对理解其行为有用。我们通过解释使用公开可用数据集创建的黑盒模型以及私人数字营销数据集来证明该方法的有效性和实用性。
