##### Abstract
Tensegrity mechanisms are composed of rigid and tensile parts that are in equilibrium. They are interesting alternative designs for some applications, such as modelling musculo-skeleton systems. Tensegrity mechanisms are more difficult to analyze than classical mechanisms as the static equilibrium conditions that must be satisfied generally result in complex equations. A class of planar one-degree-of-freedom tensegrity mechanisms with three linear springs is analyzed in detail for the sake of systematic solution classifications. The kinetostatic equations are derived and solved under several loading and geometric conditions. It is shown that these mechanisms exhibit up to six equilibrium configurations, of which one or two are stable, depending on the geometric and loading conditions. Discriminant varieties and cylindrical algebraic decomposition combined with Groebner base elimination are used to classify solutions as a function of the geometric, loading and actuator input parameters.

张拉整体机制由处于平衡状态的刚性和拉伸部分组成。对于某些应用来说，它们是有趣的替代设计，例如模拟肌肉骨架系统。张力机制比传统机制更难分析，因为必须满足的静态平衡条件通常会导致复杂的方程。为了系统的解决方案分类，详细分析了一类具有三个线性弹簧的平面一自由度张拉整体机构。在几种载荷和几何条件下导出并求解了动力学方程。结果表明，这些机构具有多达六种平衡配置，其中一种或两种是稳定的，这取决于几何和载荷条件。使用判别变量和圆柱代数分解与Groebner基消除相结合来将解作为几何，加载和致动器输入参数的函数进行分类。
