##### Abstract
We introduce DIODE, a dataset that contains thousands of diverse high resolution color images with accurate, dense, long-range depth measurements. DIODE (Dense Indoor/Outdoor DEpth) is the first public dataset to include RGBD images of indoor and outdoor scenes obtained with one sensor suite. This is in contrast to existing datasets that focus on just one domain/scene type and employ different sensors, making generalization across domains difficult.
