##### Abstract
This paper deals with classifying ambiguities for Multimodal Languages. It evolves the classifications and the methods of the literature on ambiguities for Natural Language and Visual Language, empirically defining an original classification of ambiguities for multimodal interaction using a linguistic perspective. This classification distinguishes between Semantic and Syntactic multimodal ambiguities and their subclasses, which are intercepted using a rule-based method implemented in a software module. The experimental results have achieved an accuracy of the obtained classification compared to the expected one, which are defined by the human judgment, of 94.6% for the semantic ambiguities classes, and 92.1% for the syntactic ambiguities classes.

本文讨论了多模态语言的歧义分类问题。它演化了关于自然语言和视觉语言歧义的文献的分类和方法，用语言学的视角实证地定义了多模态交互的歧义的原始分类。该分类区分语义和句法多模态歧义及其子类，其使用在软件模块中实施的基于规则的方法截取。与人类判断所预期的预期结果相比，实验结果获得了94.6％的语义歧义类和92.1％的语义歧义类的准确性。
