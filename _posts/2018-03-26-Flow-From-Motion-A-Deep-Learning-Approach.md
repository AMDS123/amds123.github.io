##### Abstract
Wearable devices have the potential to enhance sports performance, yet they are not fulfilling this promise. Our previous studies with 6 professional tennis coaches and 20 players indicate that this could be due the lack of psychological or mental state feedback, which the coaches claim to provide. Towards this end, we propose to detect the flow state, mental state of optimal performance, using wearables data to be later used in training. We performed a study with a professional tennis coach and two players. The coach provided labels about the players' flow state while each player had a wearable device on their racket holding wrist. We trained multiple models using the wearables data and the coach labels. Our deep neural network models achieved around 98% testing accuracy for a variety of conditions. This suggests that the flow state or what coaches recognize as flow, can be detected using wearables data in tennis which is a novel result. The implication for the HCI community is that having access to such information would allow for design of novel hardware and interaction paradigms that would be helpful in professional athlete training.

可穿戴设备有提升运动表现的潜力，但他们没有兑现这一承诺。我们之前对6名职业网球教练和20名球员的研究表明，这可能是由于缺乏教练声称提供的心理或精神状态反馈。为此，我们建议检测流量状态，最佳性能的心理状态，并使用可穿戴数据稍后用于训练。我们与职业网球教练和两名球员进行了一项研究。教练提供了有关球员流动状态的标签，而每位球员在他们的手腕上拿着可佩戴的设备。我们使用穿戴数据和教练标签对多个模型进行了训练。我们的深层神经网络模型在各种条件下实现了大约98％的测试精度。这表明流动状态或教练认为流动，可以使用可穿戴数据在网球中检测到，这是一个新颖的结果。 HCI社区的含义是，获得这些信息将允许设计新颖的硬件和交互范例，这对专业运动员的训练很有帮助。
