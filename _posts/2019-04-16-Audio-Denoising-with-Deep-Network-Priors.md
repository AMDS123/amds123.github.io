##### Abstract
We present a method for audio denoising that combines processing done in both the time domain and the time-frequency domain. Given a noisy audio clip, the method trains a deep neural network to fit this signal. Since the fitting is only partly successful and is able to better capture the underlying clean signal than the noise, the output of the network helps to disentangle the clean audio from the rest of the signal. The method is completely unsupervised and only trains on the specific audio clip that is being denoised. Our experiments demonstrate favorable performance in comparison to the literature methods, and our code and audio samples are available at https: //github.com/mosheman5/DNP. Index Terms: Audio denoising; Unsupervised learning
