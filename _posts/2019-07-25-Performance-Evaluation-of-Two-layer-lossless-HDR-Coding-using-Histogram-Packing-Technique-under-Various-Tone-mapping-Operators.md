##### Abstract
We proposed a lossless two-layer HDR coding method using a histogram packing technique. The proposed method was demonstrated to outperform the normative JPEG XT encoder, under the use of the default tone-mapping operator. However, the performance under various tone-mapping operators has not been discussed. In this paper, we aim to compare the performance of the proposed method with that of the JPEG XT encoder under the use of various tone-mapping operators to clearly show the characteristic difference between them.
