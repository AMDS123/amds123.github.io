##### Abstract
The capacity to recognize faces under varied poses is a fundamental human ability that presents a unique challenge for computer vision systems. Compared to frontal face recognition, which has been intensively studied and has gradually matured in the past few decades, pose-invariant face recognition (PIFR) remains a largely unsolved problem. However, PIFR is crucial to realizing the full potential of face recognition for real-world applications, since face recognition is intrinsically a passive biometric technology for recognizing uncooperative subjects. In this paper, we discuss the inherent difficulties in PIFR and present a comprehensive review of established techniques. Existing PIFR methods can be grouped into four categories, i.e., pose-robust feature extraction approaches, multi-view subspace learning approaches, face synthesis approaches, and hybrid approaches. The motivations, strategies, pros/cons, and performance of representative approaches are described and compared. Moreover, promising directions for future research are discussed.

在各种姿势下识别人脸的能力是人类的基本能力，对计算机视觉系统提出了独特的挑战。与前几十年深入研究并逐渐成熟的正面人脸识别相比，姿态不变人脸识别（PIFR）仍然是一个很大的问题。然而，PIFR对于实现真实世界应用中人脸识别的全部潜力是至关重要的，因为人脸识别本质上是用于识别不合作主题的被动生物识别技术。在本文中，我们将讨论PIFR的内在困难，并对已有技术进行综合评述。现有的PIFR方法可以分为四类，即姿态鲁棒特征提取方法，多视图子空间学习方法，人脸合成方法和混合方法。描述和比较代表性方法的动机，策略，优缺点和表现。此外，讨论未来研究的有希望的方向。
