##### Abstract
Nowadays the CNN is widely used in practical applications for image classification task. However the design of the CNN model is very professional work and which is very difficult for ordinary users. Besides, even for experts of CNN, to select an optimal model for specific task may still need a lot of time (to train many different models). In order to solve this problem, we proposed an automated CNN recommendation system for image classification task. Our system is able to evaluate the complexity of the classification task and the classification ability of the CNN model precisely. By using the evaluation results, the system can recommend the optimal CNN model and which can match the task perfectly. The recommendation process of the system is very fast since we don't need any model training. The experiment results proved that the evaluation methods are very accurate and reliable.

如今，CNN被广泛应用于图像分类任务的实际应用中。然而CNN模型的设计是非常专业的工作，对普通用户来说是非常困难的。此外，即使是CNN的专家，为具体任务选择一个最佳模型仍然需要很多时间（以培养许多不同的模型）。为了解决这个问题，我们提出了一个自动CNN推荐系统的图像分类任务。我们的系统能够精确地评估分类任务的复杂性和CNN模型的分类能力。通过使用评估结果，系统可以推荐最优的CNN模型，并且可以完美地匹配任务。由于我们不需要任何模型训练，所以系统的推荐过程非常快。实验结果证明，评价方法准确可靠。
