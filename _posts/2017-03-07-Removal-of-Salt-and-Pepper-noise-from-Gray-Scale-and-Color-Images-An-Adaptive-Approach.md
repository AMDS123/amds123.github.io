##### Abstract
An efficient adaptive algorithm for the removal of Salt and Pepper noise from gray scale and color image is presented in this paper. In this proposed method first a 3X3 window is taken and the central pixel of the window is considered as the processing pixel. If the processing pixel is found as uncorrupted, then it is left unchanged. And if the processing pixel is found corrupted one, then the window size is increased according to the conditions given in the proposed algorithm. Finally the processing pixel or the central pixel is replaced by either the mean, median or trimmed value of the elements in the current window depending upon different conditions of the algorithm. The proposed algorithm efficiently removes noise at all densities with better Peak Signal to Noise Ratio (PSNR) and Image Enhancement Factor (IEF). The proposed algorithm is compared with different existing algorithms like MF, AMF, MDBUTMF, MDBPTGMF and AWMF.

提出了一种从灰度和彩色图像中去除椒盐噪声的有效自适应算法。在这个提出的方法中，首先取一个3X3的窗口，并把窗口的中心像素当作处理像素。如果处理像素未被破坏，则保持不变。如果发现处理像素被破坏，则根据所提出的算法给出的条件增加窗口大小。最后，取决于算法的不同条件，处理像素或中心像素被当前窗口中的元素的平均值，中值或修整值替换。所提出的算法以更好的峰值信噪比（PSNR）和图像增强因子（IEF）有效地去除所有密度下的噪声。该算法与现有的不同算法如MF，AMF，MDBUTMF，MDBPTGMF和AWMF进行了比较。
