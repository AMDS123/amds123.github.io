##### Abstract
A pet that goes missing is among many people's worst fears: a moment of distraction is enough for a dog or a cat wandering off from home. Some measures help matching lost animals to their owners; but automated visual recognition is one that - although convenient, highly available, and low-cost - is surprisingly overlooked. In this paper, we inaugurate that promising avenue by pursuing face recognition for dogs. We contrast four ready-to-use human facial recognizers (EigenFaces, FisherFaces, LBPH, and a Sparse method) to two original solutions based upon convolutional neural networks: BARK (inspired in architecture-optimized networks employed for human facial recognition) and WOOF (based upon off-the-shelf OverFeat features). Human facial recognizers perform poorly for dogs (up to 60.5% accuracy), showing that dog facial recognition is not a trivial extension of human facial recognition. The convolutional network solutions work much better, with BARK attaining up to 81.1% accuracy, and WOOF, 89.4%. The tests were conducted in two datasets: Flickr-dog, with 42 dogs of two breeds (pugs and huskies); and Snoopybook, with 18 mongrel dogs.

一个失踪的宠物是许多人最担心的事情之一：一个分散注意力的时刻就足以让一只狗或一只猫在家中流浪。有些措施帮助将失去的动物与其所有者相匹配但自动化的视觉识别是一个虽然方便，高可用性和低成本，却令人惊讶地被忽视。在本文中，我们通过追求狗的脸部识别来开创这条有前景的大街。我们将四种随时可用的人脸识别器（EigenFaces，FisherFaces，LBPH和一种稀疏方法）与基于卷积神经网络的两种原始解决方案进行对比：BARK（灵感来自用于人脸识别的架构优化网络）和WOOF基于现成的OverFeat功能）。人类面部识别器对狗的表现不佳（高达60.5％的准确性），表明狗面部识别不是人类面部识别的微不足道的延伸。卷积网络解决方案效果更好，BARK的准确率达到了81.1％，WOOF为89.4％。测试进行了两个数据集：Flickr狗，42只狗的两个品种（哈巴狗和哈士奇）;和Snoopybook，有18只杂种狗。
