##### Abstract
In this paper, we aim at solving pixel-wise binary problems, including salient object segmentation, skeleton extraction, and edge detection, by introducing a unified architecture. Previous works have proposed tailored methods for solving each of the three tasks independently. Here, we show that these tasks share some similarities that can be exploited for developing a unified framework. In particular, we introduce a horizontal cascade, each component of which is densely connected to the outputs of previous component. Stringing these components together allows us to effectively exploit features across different levels hierarchically to effectively address the multiple pixel-wise binary regression tasks. To assess the performance of our proposed network on these tasks, we carry out exhaustive evaluations on multiple representative datasets. Although these tasks are inherently very different, we show that our unified approach performs very well on all of them and works far better than current single-purpose state-of-the-art methods. All the code in this paper will be publicly available.
