##### Abstract
The human visual color response is driven by specialized cells called cones, which exist in three types, viz. R, G, and B. Software is developed to simulate how color images are displayed for different types of color blindness. Specified the default color deficiency associated with a user, it generates a preview of the rainbow (in the visible range, from red to violet) and shows up, side by side with a colorful image provided as input, the display correspondent colorblind. The idea is to provide an image processing after image acquisition to enable a better perception ofcolors by the color blind. Examples of pseudo-correction are shown for the case of Protanopia (red blindness). The system is adapted into a screen of an i-pad or a cellphone in which the colorblind observe the camera, the image processed with color detail previously imperceptible by his naked eye. As prospecting, wearable computer glasses could be manufactured to provide a corrected image playback. The approach can also provide augmented reality for human vision by adding the UV or IR responses as a new feature of Google Glass.

人类的视觉颜色反应是由称为锥体的专用细胞驱动的，其存在三种类型，即， R，G和B.软件的开发是为了模拟不同类型的色盲如何显示彩色图像。指定与用户关联的默认颜色不足，它会生成彩虹预览（在可见范围内，从红色到紫色），并与作为输入提供的彩色图像并排显示，显示对应的色盲。这个想法是在图像采集之后提供一个图像处理，以便通过色盲更好地感知色彩。对于Protanopia（红色失明）的情况，显示伪校正的例子。该系统适应于在其中色盲观察相机的i-pad或手机的屏幕上，用肉眼无法察觉的用彩色细节处理的图像。作为勘探，可制造可佩带的计算机眼镜以提供校正的图像回放。该方法还可以通过添加UV或IR响应作为Google Glass的一项新功能，为人类视觉提供增强现实。
