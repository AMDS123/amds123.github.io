##### Abstract
Automation of brain matter segmentation from MR images is a challenging task due to the irregular boundaries between the grey and white matter regions. In addition, the presence of intensity inhomogeneity in the MR images further complicates the problem. In this paper, we propose a texture and vesselness incorporated version of the ScatterNet Hybrid Deep Learning Network (TS-SHDL) that extracts hierarchical invariant mid-level features, used by fisher vector encoding and a conditional random field (CRF) to perform the desired segmentation. The performance of the proposed network is evaluated by extensive experimentation and comparison with the state-of-the-art methods on several 2D MRI scans taken from the synthetic McGill Brain Web as well as on the MRBrainS dataset of real 3D MRI scans. The advantages of the TS-SHDL network over supervised deep learning networks is also presented in addition to its superior performance over the state-of-the-art.

由于灰质和白质区域之间的不规则边界，MR图像的脑物质分割自动化是一项具有挑战性的任务。另外，MR图像中强度不均匀的存在使问题进一步复杂化。在本文中，我们提出了ScatterNet混合深度学习网络（TS-SHDL）的纹理和导管融合版本，其提取由Fisher矢量编码和条件随机场（CRF）执行期望的层级不变中间特征分割。所提出的网络的性能通过广泛的实验以及与从合成McGill Brain Web取得的几个2D MRI扫描中的最先进方法的比较以及在真实3D MRI扫描的MRBrainS数据集上的评估来评估。 TS-SHDL网络优于有监督的深度学习网络的优点还体现在优越的性能上。
