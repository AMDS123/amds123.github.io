##### Abstract
De-fencing is to eliminate the captured fence on an image or a video, providing a clear view of the scene. It has been applied for many purposes including assisting photographers and improving the performance of computer vision algorithms such as object detection and recognition. However, the state-of-the-art de-fencing methods have limited performance caused by the difficulty of fence segmentation and also suffer from the motion of the camera or objects. To overcome these problems, we propose a novel method consisting of segmentation using convolutional neural networks and a fast/robust recovery algorithm. The segmentation algorithm using convolutional neural network achieves significant improvement in the accuracy of fence segmentation. The recovery algorithm using optical flow produces plausible de-fenced images and videos. The proposed method is experimented on both our diverse and complex dataset and publicly available datasets. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves the state-of-the-art performance for both segmentation and content recovery.

防护是为了消除图像或视频上捕获的栅栏，提供场景的清晰视图。它已经应用于许多目的，包括协助摄影师和改善计算机视觉算法的性能，如物体检测和识别。然而，由于栅栏分割的困难而导致的最新防护方法的性能有限，并且还受到照相机或物体的运动的困扰。为了克服这些问题，我们提出了一种使用卷积神经网络和快速/鲁棒恢复算法进行分割的新方法。使用卷积神经网络的分割算法实现了围栏分割精度的显着提高。使用光流的恢复算法产生似是而非的防护图像和视频。所提出的方法在我们不同的和复杂的数据集和公开可用的数据集上进行实验。实验结果表明，该方法实现了分段和内容恢复的最先进的性能。
