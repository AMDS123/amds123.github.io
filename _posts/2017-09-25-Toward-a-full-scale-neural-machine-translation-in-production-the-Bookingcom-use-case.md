##### Abstract
While some remarkable progress has been made in neural machine translation (NMT) research, there have not been many reports on its development and evaluation in practice. This paper tries to fill this gap by presenting some of our findings from building an in-house travel domain NMT system in a large scale E-commerce setting. The three major topics that we cover are optimization and training (including different optimization strategies and corpus sizes), handling real-world content and evaluating results.
