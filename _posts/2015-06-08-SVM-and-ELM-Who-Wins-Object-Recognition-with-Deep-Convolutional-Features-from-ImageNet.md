##### Abstract
Deep learning with a convolutional neural network (CNN) has been proved to be very effective in feature extraction and representation of images. For image classification problems, this work aim at finding which classifier is more competitive based on high-level deep features of images. In this report, we have discussed the nearest neighbor, support vector machines and extreme learning machines for image classification under deep convolutional activation feature representation. Specifically, we adopt the benchmark object recognition dataset from multiple sources with domain bias for evaluating different classifiers. The deep features of the object dataset are obtained by a well-trained CNN with five convolutional layers and three fully-connected layers on the challenging ImageNet. Experiments demonstrate that the ELMs outperform SVMs in cross-domain recognition tasks. In particular, state-of-the-art results are obtained by kernel ELM which outperforms SVMs with about 4% of the average accuracy. The features and codes are available in this http URL

用卷积神经网络（CNN）进行深度学习已经被证明是非常有效的特征提取和图像表示。针对图像分类问题，本研究的目标是基于图像的高层次深度特征，找出哪个分类器更具竞争力。在这个报告中，我们讨论了深度卷积激活特征表示下的最近邻，支持向量机和极限学习机的图像分类。具体而言，我们采用来自多个来源的具有域偏差的基准对象识别数据集来评估不同的分类器。对象数据集的深度特征是由具有挑战性的ImageNet上的五个卷积层和三个完全连接层的训练有素的CNN获得的。实验证明ELM在跨域识别任务中胜过SVM。尤其是，最先进的结果通过内核ELM获得，其优于平均精度约4％的SVM。这个功能和代码可以在这个http URL中找到
