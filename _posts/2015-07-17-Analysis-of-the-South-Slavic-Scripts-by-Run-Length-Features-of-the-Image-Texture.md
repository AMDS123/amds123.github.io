##### Abstract
The paper proposes an algorithm for the script recognition based on the texture characteristics. The image texture is achieved by coding each letter with the equivalent script type (number code) according to its position in the text line. Each code is transformed into equivalent gray level pixel creating an 1-D image. Then, the image texture is subjected to the run-length analysis. This analysis extracts the run-length features, which are classified to make a distinction between the scripts under consideration. In the experiment, a custom oriented database is subject to the proposed algorithm. The database consists of some text documents written in Cyrillic, Latin and Glagolitic scripts. Furthermore, it is divided into training and test parts. The results of the experiment show that 3 out of 5 run-length features can be used for effective differentiation between the analyzed South Slavic scripts.

##### Abstract (translated by Google)
本文提出了一种基于纹理特征的脚本识别算法。图像纹理是通过根据其在文本行中的位置用等效的脚本类型（数字代码）对每个字母进行编码来实现的。每个代码被转换成等效的灰度级像素来创建一维图像。然后，对图像纹理进行游程长度分析。该分析提取了划分的游程长度特征，以区分正在考虑的脚本。在这个实验中，一个定制的数据库受制于所提出的算法。数据库由一些用西里尔文，拉丁文和格拉斯哥文字书写的文本文件组成。此外，它分为训练和测试部分。实验结果显示，5个游程长度特征中的3个可以用于分析南斯拉夫文字之间的有效区分。
