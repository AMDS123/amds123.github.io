##### Abstract
The identification of authorship in disputed documents still requires human expertise, which is now unfeasible for many tasks owing to the large volumes of text and authors in practical applications. In this study, we introduce a methodology based on the dynamics of word co-occurrence networks representing written texts to classify a corpus of 80 texts by 8 authors. The texts were divided into sections with equal number of linguistic tokens, from which time series were created for 12 topological metrics. The series were proven to be stationary (p-value>0.05), which permits to use distribution moments as learning attributes. With an optimized supervised learning procedure using a Radial Basis Function Network, 68 out of 80 texts were correctly classified, i.e. a remarkable 85% author matching success rate. Therefore, fluctuations in purely dynamic network metrics were found to characterize authorship, thus opening the way for the description of texts in terms of small evolving networks. Moreover, the approach introduced allows for comparison of texts with diverse characteristics in a simple, fast fashion.

在有争议的文件中对作者身份的认定仍然需要人类的专业知识，由于大量文本和作者在实际应用中，这对许多任务来说是不可行的。在这项研究中，我们介绍了一种方法，基于代表书面文字的词共现网络的动力学，由8位作者对80个文本的语料进行分类。这些文本被分成几个等同数量的语言标记，从中为12个拓扑指标创建时间序列。该系列被证明是静止的（p值> 0.05），允许使用分布矩作为学习属性。通过使用径向基函数网络的优化的监督学习过程，80个文本中的68个被正确分类，即85％的作者匹配成功率显着。因此，纯粹的动态网络指标的波动被认为是描述作者身份的特征，从而为以小演化网络描述文本开辟了道路。而且，所引入的方法允许以简单，快速的方式比较具有不同特征的文本。
