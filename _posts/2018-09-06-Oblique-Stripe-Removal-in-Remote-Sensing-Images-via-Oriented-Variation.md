##### Abstract
Destriping is a classical problem in remote sensing image processing. Although considerable effort has been made to remove stripes, few of the existing methods can eliminate stripe noise with arbitrary orientations. This situation makes the removal of oblique stripes in the higher-level remote sensing products become an unfinished and urgent issue. To overcome the challenging problem, we propose a novel destriping model which is self-adjusted to different orientations of stripe noise. First of all, the oriented variation model is designed to accomplish the stripe orientation approximation. In this model, the stripe direction is automatically estimated and then imbedded into the constraint term to depict the along-stripe smoothness of the stripe component. Mainly based on the oriented variation model, a whole destriping framework is proposed by jointly employing an L1-norm constraint and a TV regularization to separately capture the global distribution property of stripe component and the piecewise smoothness of the clean image. The qualitative and quantitative experimental results of both orientation and destriping aspects confirm the effectiveness and stability of the proposed method.

去条纹是遥感图像处理中的经典问题。尽管已经做出相当大的努力来去除条纹，但是现有方法中的一些可以消除具有任意方向的条纹噪声。这种情况使得更高级别的遥感产品中的斜条纹的移除成为未完成和紧迫的问题。为了克服这个具有挑战性的问题，我们提出了一种新的去条纹模型，它可以根据条纹噪声的不同方向进行自我调整。首先，设计定向变化模型以实现条纹取向近似。在该模型中，自动估计条纹方向，然后嵌入约束项中以描绘条纹组件的沿条纹平滑度。主要基于面向变异模型，结合L1范数约束和TV正则化分别捕获条纹分量的全局分布特性和清晰图像的分段平滑性，提出了一个完整的去条带框架。定向和去条纹方面的定性和定量实验结果证实了所提方法的有效性和稳定性。
