##### Abstract
Reconstructing the missing parts of a curve has been the subject of much computational research, with applications in image inpainting, object synthesis, etc. Different approaches for solving that problem are typically based on processes that seek visually pleasing or perceptually plausible completions. In this work we focus on reconstructing the underlying physically likely shape by utilizing the global statistics of natural curves. More specifically, we develop a reconstruction model that seeks the mean physical curve for a given inducer configuration. This simple model is both straightforward to compute and it is receptive to diverse additional information, but it requires enough samples for all curve configurations, a practical requirement that limits its effective utilization. To address this practical issue we explore and exploit statistical geometrical properties of natural curves, and in particular, we show that in many cases the mean curve is scale invariant and oftentimes it is extensible. This, in turn, allows to boost the number of examples and thus the robustness of the statistics and its applicability. The reconstruction results are not only more physically plausible but they also lead to important insights on the reconstruction problem, including an elegant explanation why certain inducer configurations are more likely to yield consistent perceptual completions than others.

重构曲线的缺失部分一直是计算研究的主题，在图像修复，对象合成等方面的应用。解决该问题的不同方法通常基于寻求视觉愉悦或感觉上合理的完成的过程。在这项工作中，我们专注于利用自然曲线的全球统计数据重建潜在的物理形状。更具体地说，我们开发了一个重建模型，寻找一个给定的诱导物配置的平均物理曲线。这个简单的模型既易于计算，又可以接受各种附加信息，但是对于所有曲线配置需要足够的样本，这是一个限制其有效利用率的实际要求。为了解决这个实际问题，我们探索和利用了自然曲线的统计几何特性，特别是，我们表明，在许多情况下，平均曲线是尺度不变的，并且通常是可扩展的。这反过来又可以增加例子的数量，从而提高统计的稳健性和适用性。重建的结果不仅更加物理上合理，而且还导致重建问题的重要见解，包括一个优雅的解释，为什么某些诱导物配置更有可能产生一致的知觉完成比其他。
