##### Abstract
Feature curves are largely adopted to highlight shape features, such as sharp lines, or to divide surfaces into meaningful segments, like convex or concave regions. Extracting these curves is not sufficient to convey prominent and meaningful information about a shape. We have first to separate the curves belonging to features from those caused by noise and then to select the lines, which describe non-trivial portions of a surface. The automatic detection of such features is crucial for the identification and/or annotation of relevant parts of a given shape. To do this, the Hough transform (HT) is a feature extraction technique widely used in image analysis, computer vision and digital image processing, while, for 3D shapes, the extraction of salient feature curves is still an open problem. Thanks to algebraic geometry concepts, the HT technique has been recently extended to include a vast class of algebraic curves, thus proving to be a competitive tool for yielding an explicit representation of the diverse feature lines equations. In the paper, for the first time we apply this novel extension of the HT technique to the realm of 3D shapes in order to identify and localize semantic features like patterns, decorations or anatomical details on 3D objects (both complete and fragments), even in the case of features partially damaged or incomplete. The method recognizes various features, possibly compound, and it selects the most suitable feature profiles among families of algebraic curves.

特征曲线在很大程度上被用来突出形状特征，例如尖锐的线条，或者将表面划分成有意义的部分，如凸形或凹形区域。提取这些曲线不足以传达关于形状的显着和有意义的信息。我们首先将属于特征的曲线与由噪声引起的曲线分开，然后选择描述表面的非平凡部分的线。这些特征的自动检测对于给定形状的相关部分的识别和/或注释是至关重要的。为此，霍夫变换（HT）是一种广泛应用于图像分析，计算机视觉和数字图像处理的特征提取技术，而对于三维形状，提取显着特征曲线仍然是一个悬而未决的问题。由于代数几何的概念，HT技术最近已经扩展到包括一大类代数曲线，因此被证明是产生各种特征线方程的明确表示的竞争工具。在本文中，我们首次将这种HT技术的新颖扩展应用到3D形状的领域，以便识别和定位3D对象（完整和片段）上的图案，装饰或解剖细节的语义特征，甚至在特征部分损坏或不完整的情况。该方法识别各种特征，可能是复合的，并且在代数曲线族中选择最合适的特征曲线。
