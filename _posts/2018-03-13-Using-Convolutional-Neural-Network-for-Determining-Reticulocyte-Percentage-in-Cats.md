##### Abstract
Recent advances in artificial intelligence (AI), specifically in computer vision (CV) and deep learning (DL), have created opportunities for novel systems in many fields. In the last few years, deep learning applications have demonstrated impressive results not only in fields such as autonomous driving and robotics, but also in the field of medicine, where they have, in some cases, even exceeded human-level performance. However, despite the huge potential, adoption of deep learning-based methods is still slow in many areas, especially in veterinary medicine, where we haven't been able to find any research papers using modern convolutional neural networks (CNNs) in medical image processing. We believe that using deep learning-based medical imaging can enable more accurate, faster and less expensive diagnoses in veterinary medicine. In order to do so, however, these methods have to be accessible to everyone in this field, not just to computer scientists. To show the potential of this technology, we present results on a real-world task in veterinary medicine that is usually done manually: feline reticulocyte percentage. Using an open source Keras implementation of the Single-Shot MultiBox Detector (SSD) model architecture and training it on only 800 labeled images, we achieve an accuracy of 98.7% at predicting the correct number of aggregate reticulocytes in microscope images of cat blood smears. The main motivation behind this paper is to show not only that deep learning can approach or even exceed human-level performance on a task like this, but also that anyone in the field can implement it, even without a background in computer science.

##### Abstract (translated by Google)
人工智能（AI）方面的最新进展，特别是计算机视觉（CV）和深度学习（DL），为许多领域的新颖系统创造了机会。在过去的几年里，深度学习应用不仅在自动驾驶和机器人领域取得了令人瞩目的成就，而且在医学领域也取得了令人瞩目的成果，有些甚至超过了人类的表现。然而，尽管潜力巨大，但在许多领域采用基于深度学习的方法仍然很慢，尤其是在兽医学领域，我们无法在医学图像处理中找到任何使用现代卷积神经网络（CNN）的研究论文。我们相信，使用基于深度学习的医学成像可以实现更准确，更快，更便宜的兽医诊断。然而，为了这样做，这些方法必须能够被这个领域的每个人所使用，而不仅仅是计算机科学家。为了展示这项技术的潜力，我们将结果呈现在通常人工完成的兽医实际任务中：猫网织红细胞百分比。使用开放源码Keras实施的单发多盒探测器（SSD）模型架构并仅对800个标记图像进行训练，我们在猫血涂片的显微镜图像中预测聚集网织红细胞的正确数量的准确率达到98.7％。本文背后的主要动机是不仅表明深度学习可以接近甚至超越人类在这样的任务中的表现，而且即使没有计算机科学的背景知识，任何领域的人都可以实现它。
