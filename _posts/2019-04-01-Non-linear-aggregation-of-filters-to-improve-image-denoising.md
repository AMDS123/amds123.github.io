##### Abstract
We introduce a novel aggregation method to efficiently perform image denoising. Preliminary filters are aggregated in a non-linear fashion, using a new metric of pixel proximity based on how the pool of filters reaches a consensus. The numerical performance of the method is illustrated and we show that the aggregate significantly outperforms each of the preliminary filters.
