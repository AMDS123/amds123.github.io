##### Abstract
Conventional sequential learning methods such as Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) focus on interactions between consecutive inputs, i.e. first-order Markovian dependency. However, most of sequential data, as seen with videos, have complex temporal dependencies that imply variable-length semantic flows and their compositions, and those are hard to be captured by conventional methods. Here, we propose Temporal Dependency Networks (TDNs) for learning video data by discovering these complex structures of the videos. The TDNs represent video as a graph whose nodes and edges correspond to frames of the video and their dependencies respectively. Via a parameterized kernel with graph-cut and graph convolutions, the TDNs find compositional temporal dependencies of the data in multilevel graph forms. We evaluate the proposed method on the large-scale video dataset Youtube-8M. The experimental results show that our model efficiently learns the complex semantic structure of video data.
