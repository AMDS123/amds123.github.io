##### Abstract
A surface-based diffeomorphic algorithm to generate 3D coordinate grids in the cortical ribbon is described. In the grid, normal coordinate lines are generated by the diffeomorphic evolution from the grey/white (inner) surface to the grey/csf (outer) surface. Specifically, the cortical ribbon is described by two triangulated surfaces with open boundaries. Conceptually, the inner surface sits on top of the white matter structure and the outer on top of the gray matter. It is assumed that the cortical ribbon consists of cortical columns which are orthogonal to the white matter surface. This might be viewed as a consequence of the development of the columns in the embryo. It is also assumed that the columns are orthogonal to the outer surface so that the resultant vector field is orthogonal to the evolving surface. Then the distance of trajectories from the vector field such that the inner surface evolves diffeomorphically towards the outer one can be construed as a measure of thickness. Applications are described for the auditory cortices in human adults and cats with normal hearing or hearing loss. The approach offers great potential for cortical morphometry.

描述了一种基于表面的微分形态算法，用于在皮质带中生成3D坐标网格。在网格中，通过从灰/白（内）表面到灰/ csf（外）表面的微分演化生成法线。具体而言，皮质带由具有开放边界的两个三角形表面来描述。从概念上讲，内表面位于白质结构的顶部和灰质顶部的外部。假定皮质带由与白质表面正交的皮质柱组成。这可能被视为胚胎中柱子发育的结果。还假设列与外表面正交，使得合成矢量场与演化表面正交。然后，轨迹距离矢量场的距离使得内表面朝向外部展开有限差分形式可以被解释为厚度的量度。描述了成年人和正常听力或听力丧失的猫的听觉皮层的应用。该方法为皮层形态测量提供了巨大的潜力。
