##### Abstract
Prof. Robert Berwick's abstract for his forthcoming invited talk at the ACL2016 workshop on Cognitive Aspects of Computational Language Learning revives an ancient debate. Entitled "Why take a chance?", Berwick seems to refer implicitly to Chomsky's critique of the statistical approach of Harris as well as the currently dominant paradigms in CoNLL. Berwick avoids Chomsky's use of "innate" but states that "the debate over the existence of sophisticated mental grammars was settled with Chomsky's Logical Structure of Linguistic Theory (1957/1975)", acknowledging that "this debate has often been revived". This paper agrees with the view that this debate has long since been settled, but with the opposite outcome! Given the embers have not yet died away, and the questions remain fundamental, perhaps it is appropriate to refuel the debate, so I would like to join Bob in throwing fuel on this fire by reviewing the evidence against the Chomskian position!

##### Abstract (translated by Google)
罗伯特·贝里克（Robert Berwick）教授在即将到来的ACL2016计算机语言学习认知方面研讨会上发表的摘要重现了一场古老的辩论。 Berwick似乎暗指乔姆斯基对哈里斯的统计方法的批判以及目前在共和联盟中占统治地位的范式。贝里克避免了乔姆斯基对“先天”的使用，而是指出“关于复杂的智力语法存在的争论是用乔姆斯基的语言理论的逻辑结构（1957/1975）”来解决的，“承认”这个辩论经常被复活“。本文同意这样的观点，即这场辩论早已解决，但结果却相反！考虑到余烬还没有消失，问题仍然是根本，也许加强辩论是适当的，所以我想加入鲍勃在这场火上加油，审查反对乔姆斯基的立场的证据！
