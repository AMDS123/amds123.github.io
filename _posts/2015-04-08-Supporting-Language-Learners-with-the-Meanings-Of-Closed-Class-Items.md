##### Abstract
The process of language learning involves the mastery of countless tasks: making the constituent sounds of the language being learned, learning the grammatical patterns, and acquiring the requisite vocabulary for reception and production. While a plethora of computational tools exist to facilitate the first and second of these tasks, a number of challenges arise with respect to enabling the third. This paper describes a tool that has been designed to support language learners with the challenge of understanding the use of closed-class lexical items. The process of learning the Arabic for office is (mktb) is relatively simple and should be possible by means of simple repetition of the word. However, it is much more difficult to learn and correctly use the Arabic equivalent of the word on. The current paper describes a mechanism for the delivery of diagnostic information regarding specific lexical examples, with the aim of clearly demonstrating why a particular translation of a given closed-class item may be appropriate in certain situations but not others, thereby helping learners to understand and use the term correctly.

语言学习的过程涉及无数的任务的掌握：使语言的组成语音学习，学习语法模式，并获得必要的接收和生产词汇。虽然存在大量的计算工具来促进这些任务的第一个和第二个，但是在启用第三个任务方面存在许多挑战。本文描述了一个旨在支持语言学习者理解使用封闭类词汇项目的挑战的工具。学习阿拉伯语办公室的过程是（mktb）相对简单，应该可以通过简单的重复这个词来实现。然而，学习和正确使用阿拉伯语的这个词相当困难得多。目前的论文描述了一个机制，提供有关特定词汇的诊断信息的例子，目的是清楚地说明为什么特定的封闭类项目的翻译可能是适当的在某些情况下，而不是其他的，从而帮助学习者了解和正确使用这个词。
