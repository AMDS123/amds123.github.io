##### Abstract
This study implements a vector space model approach to measure the sentiment orientations of words. Two representative vectors for positive/negative polarity are constructed using high-dimensional vec-tor space in both an unsupervised and a semi-supervised manner. A sentiment ori-entation value per word is determined by taking the difference between the cosine distances against the two reference vec-tors. These two conditions (unsupervised and semi-supervised) are compared against an existing unsupervised method (Turney, 2002). As a result of our experi-ment, we demonstrate that this novel ap-proach significantly outperforms the pre-vious unsupervised approach and is more practical and data efficient as well.

本研究采用向量空间模型的方法来衡量词的情感取向。在无监督和半监督两种情况下，使用高维向量空间构造了两个有正/负极性的代表向量。通过取两个参考矢量之间的余弦距离之差来确定每个单词的情感取向值。将这两个条件（无监督和半监督）与现有的无监督方法进行比较（Turney，2002）。作为我们实验的结果，我们证明了这种新颖的方法明显胜过了先前的无监督方法，并且更加实用和数据有效。
