##### Abstract
Colour analysis is a crucial step in image-based fire detection algorithms. Many of the proposed fire detection algorithms in a still image are prone to false alarms caused by objects with a colour similar to fire. To design a colour-based system with a better false alarm rate, a new colour-differentiating conversion matrix, efficient on images of high colour complexity, is proposed. The elements of this conversion matrix are obtained by performing K-medoids clustering and Particle Swarm Optimisation procedures on a fire sample image with a background of high fire-colour similarity. The proposed conversion matrix is then used to construct two new fire colour detection frameworks. The first detection method is a two-stage non-linear image transformation framework, while the second is a direct transformation of an image with the proposed conversion matrix. A performance comparison of the proposed methods with alternate methods in the literature was carried out. Experimental results indicate that the linear image transformation method outperforms other methods regarding false alarm rate while the non-linear two-stage image transformation method has the best performance on the F-score metric and provides a better trade-off between missed detection and false alarm rate.

色彩分析是基于图像的火灾探测算法的关键一步。许多在静止图像中提出的火灾检测算法容易由于颜色类似于火的物体而引起误报。为了设计具有更好误报率的基于颜色的系统，提出了一种新的颜色区分转换矩阵，其对高颜色复杂度的图像有效。该转换矩阵的元素是通过对具有高火色相似性背景的火样本图像执行K-medoids聚类和粒子群优化程序而获得的。建议的转换矩阵然后用于构建两个新的火灾颜色检测框架。第一种检测方法是两阶段非线性图像变换框架，而第二种检测方法是用所提出的转换矩阵对图像进行直接变换。所提出的方法与文献中的替代方法的性能比较被执行。实验结果表明，线性图像变换方法在误报率方面优于其他方法，而非线性两级图像变换方法在F-score度量方面性能最好，并且在漏检和误报之间提供了更好的折衷率。
