##### Abstract
Text in curve orientation, despite being one of the common text orientations in real world environment, has close to zero existence in well received scene text datasets such as ICDAR2013 and MSRA-TD500. The main motivation of Total-Text is to fill this gap and facilitate a new research direction for the scene text community. On top of the conventional horizontal and multi-oriented texts, it features curved-oriented text. Total-Text is highly diversified in orientations, more than half of its images have a combination of more than two orientations. Recently, a new breed of solutions that casted text detection as a segmentation problem has demonstrated their effectiveness against multi-oriented text. In order to evaluate its robustness against curved text, we fine-tuned DeconvNet and benchmark it on Total-Text. Total-Text with its annotation is available at this https URL

##### Abstract (translated by Google)
尽管作为现实世界环境中常见的文本取向之一的曲线取向文本在ICDAR2013和MSRA-TD500等良好接收的场景文本数据集中存在接近于零的存在。 Total-Text的主要动机是填补这个空白，并为现场文本社区提供一个新的研究方向。在传统的横向和多面向文本之上，它具有曲面文本。 Total-Text在方向上高度多样化，超过一半的图像具有两个以上方向的组合。最近，文本检测作为分割问题的一种新的解决方案已经证明了它们对多向文本的有效性。为了评估其对曲线文本的鲁棒性，我们对DeconvNet进行了微调，并在Total-Text上进行了基准测试。带有注释的Total-Text可在此https URL中获得
