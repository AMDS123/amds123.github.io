##### Abstract
Photographing scenes with high dynamic range (HDR) poses great challenges to consumer cameras with their limited sensor bit depth. To address this, Zhao et al. recently proposed a novel sensor concept - the modulo camera - which captures the least significant bits of the recorded scene instead of going into saturation. Similar to conventional pipelines, HDR images can be reconstructed from multiple exposures, but significantly fewer images are needed than with a typical saturating sensor. While the concept is appealing, we show that the original reconstruction approach assumes noise-free measurements and quickly breaks down otherwise. To address this, we propose a novel reconstruction algorithm that is robust to image noise and produces significantly fewer artifacts. We theoretically analyze correctness as well as limitations, and show that our approach significantly outperforms the baseline on real data.

拍摄具有高动态范围（HDR）的场景对消费性相机的传感器位深度有限造成巨大挑战。为了解决这个问题，赵等人。最近提出了一种新颖的传感器概念 - 模相机 - 它捕获记录场景的最低有效位而不是进入饱和状态。类似于传统的管线，HDR图像可以从多次曝光重建，但比典型的饱和传感器需要的图像要少得多。虽然这个概念很有吸引力，但是我们表明，原始的重建方法假定无噪声的测量，否则很快就会中断。为了解决这个问题，我们提出了一种新的重建算法，对图像噪声是鲁棒的，并产生显着更少的文物。我们从理论上分析了正确性和局限性，表明我们的方法明显优于实际数据的基准。
