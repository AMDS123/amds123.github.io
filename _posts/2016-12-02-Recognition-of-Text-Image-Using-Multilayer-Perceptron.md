##### Abstract
The biggest challenge in the field of image processing is to recognize documents both in printed and handwritten format. Optical Character Recognition OCR is a type of document image analysis where scanned digital image that contains either machine printed or handwritten script input into an OCR software engine and translating it into an editable machine readable digital text format. A Neural network is designed to model the way in which the brain performs a particular task or function of interest: The neural network is simulated in software on a digital computer. Character Recognition refers to the process of converting printed Text documents into translated Unicode Text. The printed documents available in the form of books, papers, magazines, etc. are scanned using standard scanners which produce an image of the scanned document. Lines are identifying by an algorithm where we identify top and bottom of line. Then in each line character boundaries are calculated by an algorithm then using these calculation, characters is isolated from the image and then we classify each character by basic back propagation. Each image character is comprised of 30*20 pixels. We have used the Back propagation Neural Network for efficient recognition where the errors were corrected through back propagation and rectified neuron values were transmitted by feed-forward method in the neural network of multiple layers.

图像处理领域最大的挑战是识别印刷和手写格式的文件。光学字符识别OCR是一种文档图像分析，扫描数字图像包含机器打印或手写脚本输入到OCR软件引擎，并将其转换为可编辑的机器可读数字文本格式。神经网络被设计用于模拟大脑执行特定任务或功能的方式：神经网络在数字计算机上用软件模拟。字符识别是指将打印的文本文档转换为翻译的Unicode文本的过程。使用标准扫描仪扫描以书籍，报纸，杂志等形式提供的印刷文件，这些扫描仪产生扫描文件的图像。线是通过一个算法来识别，我们确定线的顶部和底部。然后在每一行字符边界通过算法计算，然后使用这些计算，字符与图像隔离，然后通过基本的反向传播对每个字符进行分类。每个图像字符由30×20个像素组成。我们使用反向传播神经网络进行高效识别，通过反向传播纠正错误，在多层神经网络中通过前馈方法传输整流神经元值。
