##### Abstract
The utility of Twitter data as a medium to support population-level mental health monitoring is not well understood. In an effort to better understand the predictive power of supervised machine learning classifiers and the influence of feature sets for efficiently classifying depression-related tweets on a large-scale, we conducted two feature study experiments. In the first experiment, we assessed the contribution of feature groups such as lexical information (e.g., unigrams) and emotions (e.g., strongly negative) using a feature ablation study. In the second experiment, we determined the percentile of top ranked features that produced the optimal classification performance by applying a three-step feature elimination approach. In the first experiment, we observed that lexical features are critical for identifying depressive symptoms, specifically for depressed mood (-35 points) and for disturbed sleep (-43 points). In the second experiment, we observed that the optimal F1-score performance of top ranked features in percentiles variably ranged across classes e.g., fatigue or loss of energy (5th percentile, 288 features) to depressed mood (55th percentile, 3,168 features) suggesting there is no consistent count of features for predicting depressive-related tweets. We conclude that simple lexical features and reduced feature sets can produce comparable results to larger feature sets.

推特数据作为支持人口水平心理健康监测的媒介的效用尚不清楚。为了更好地理解监督机器学习分类器的预测能力和特征集对大规模抑郁相关推文的有效分类的影响，我们进行了两个特征研究实验。在第一个实验中，我们使用特征消融研究评估了诸如词汇信息（例如unigrams）和情绪（例如，强烈否定）的特征组的贡献。在第二个实验中，我们通过应用三步特征消除方法确定产生最佳分类性能的排名最高的特征的百分比。在第一个实验中，我们观察到，词汇特征对于确定抑郁症状至关重要，特别是抑郁症状（-35分）和睡眠不安（-43分）。在第二个实验中，我们观察到，百分位数最高排名特征的最佳F1得分表现在不同类别之间可变地变化，例如疲劳或能量损失（第5百分位，288特征）到抑郁情绪（第55百分位，3,168特征）预测抑郁相关推文的功能并不一致。我们得出这样的结论：简单的词汇特征和减少的特征集可以产生与较大的特征集相当的结果。
