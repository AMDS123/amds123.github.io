##### Abstract
Visual attributes are great means of describing images or scenes, in a way both humans and computers understand. In order to establish a correspondence between images and to be able to compare the strength of each property between images, relative attributes were introduced. However, since their introduction, hand-crafted and engineered features were used to learn increasingly complex models for the problem of relative attributes. This limits the applicability of those methods for more realistic cases. We introduce a deep neural network architecture for the task of relative attribute prediction. A convolutional neural network (ConvNet) is adopted to learn the features by including an additional layer (ranking layer) that learns to rank the images based on these features. We adopt an appropriate ranking loss to train the whole network in an end-to-end fashion. Our proposed method outperforms the baseline and state-of-the-art methods in relative attribute prediction on various coarse and fine-grained datasets. Our qualitative results along with the visualization of the saliency maps show that the network is able to learn effective features for each specific attribute. Source code of the proposed method is available at this https URL

##### Abstract (translated by Google)
视觉属性是用人和计算机都能理解的方式描述图像或场景的重要手段。为了建立图像之间的对应关系，并且能够比较图像之间每个属性的强度，引入了相关属性。然而，自引入以来，手工制作和工程化特征被用于学习越来越复杂的相关属性问题模型。这限制了这些方法适用于更现实的情况。针对相关属性预测任务，引入深度神经网络体系结构。卷积神经网络（ConvNet）被用来通过包括额外的图层（排名图层）来学习这些特征，该图层根据这些特征学习排列图像。我们采取适当的排名损失来对整个网络进行端到端的培训。我们提出的方法在各种粗粒度和细粒度数据集上的相对属性预测中优于基线和现有技术的方法。我们定性的结果以及显着性图的可视化表明，网络能够为每个特定的属性学习有效的特征。所提议的方法的源代码可在此https URL处获得
