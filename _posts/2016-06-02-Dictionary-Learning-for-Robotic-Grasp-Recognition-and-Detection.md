##### Abstract
The ability to grasp ordinary and potentially never-seen objects is an important feature in both domestic and industrial robotics. For a system to accomplish this, it must autonomously identify grasping locations by using information from various sensors, such as Microsoft Kinect 3D camera. Despite numerous progress, significant work still remains to be done in this field. To this effect, we propose a dictionary learning and sparse representation (DLSR) framework for representing RGBD images from 3D sensors in the context of determining such good grasping locations. In contrast to previously proposed approaches that relied on sophisticated regularization or very large datasets, the derived perception system has a fast training phase and can work with small datasets. It is also theoretically founded for dealing with masked-out entries, which are common with 3D sensors. We contribute by presenting a comparative study of several DLSR approach combinations for recognizing and detecting grasp candidates on the standard Cornell dataset. Importantly, experimental results show a performance improvement of 1.69% in detection and 3.16% in recognition over current state-of-the-art convolutional neural network (CNN). Even though nowadays most popular vision-based approach is CNN, this suggests that DLSR is also a viable alternative with interesting advantages that CNN has not.

掌握普通和可能未曾见过的物体的能力是家用和工业机器人的重要特征。为了实现这一目标，系统必须通过使用来自各种传感器（例如Microsoft Kinect 3D相机）的信息自动识别抓取位置。尽管取得了很多进展，但在这个领域还有很多工作要做。为此，我们提出了一个字典学习和稀疏表示（DLSR）框架来表示从3D传感器的RGBD图像的上下文中确定这样好的抓取位置。与先前提出的依靠复杂的正则化或非常大的数据集的方法相比，派生的感知系统具有快速的训练阶段并且可以与小数据集一起工作。它也是在理论上建立的，用于处理3D传感器常见的蒙版输入。我们通过提出几个DLSR方法组合的比较研究来贡献，以识别和检测标准康奈尔数据集上的候选对象。重要的是，实验结果显示检测性能提高了1.69％，而目前最先进的卷积神经网络（CNN）的性能提高了3.16％。即使现在最流行的基于视觉的方法是CNN，这也表明DLSR也是一个可行的替代方案，CNN没有的有趣的优势。
