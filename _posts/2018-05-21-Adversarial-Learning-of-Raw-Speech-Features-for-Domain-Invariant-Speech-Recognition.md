##### Abstract
Recent advances in neural network based acoustic modelling have shown significant improvements in automatic speech recognition (ASR) performance. In order for acoustic models to be able to handle large acoustic variability, large amounts of labeled data is necessary, which are often expensive to obtain. This paper explores the application of adversarial training to learn features from raw speech that are invariant to acoustic variability. This acoustic variability is referred to as a domain shift in this paper. The experimental study presented in this paper leverages the architecture of Domain Adversarial Neural Networks (DANNs) [1] which uses data from two different domains. The DANN is a Y-shaped network that consists of a multi-layer CNN feature extractor module that is common to a label (senone) classifier and a so-called domain classifier. The utility of DANNs is evaluated on multiple datasets with domain shifts caused due to differences in gender and speaker accents. Promising empirical results indicate the strength of adversarial training for unsupervised domain adaptation in ASR, thereby emphasizing the ability of DANNs to learn domain invariant features from raw speech.

基于神经网络的声学建模方面的最新进展显示了自动语音识别（ASR）性能的显着改进。为了使声学模型能够处理大的声学变化，需要大量的标记数据，这通常是昂贵的。本文探讨了对抗训练的应用，以从原始语音中学习不变声学变化的特征。这种声学变异性在本文中被称为域变换。本文提出的实验研究利用了域对抗神经网络（DANNs）[1]的架构，该架构使用来自两个不同领域的数据。 DANN是一个Y形网络，由一个多层CNN特征提取模块组成，它是一个标签（senone）分类器和一个所谓的域分类器所共有的。 DANNs的效用在多个数据集上进行评估，这些数据集由于性别和说话者口音的差异而导致了域转移。有前景的实证结果表明ASR中无监督域适应的对抗训练强度，从而强调了DANN从原始语音中学习域不变特征的能力。
