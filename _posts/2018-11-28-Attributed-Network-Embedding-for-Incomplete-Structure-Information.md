##### Abstract
An attributed network enriches a pure network by encoding a part of widely accessible node auxiliary information into node attributes. Learning vector representation of each node a.k.a. Network Embedding (NE) for such an attributed network by considering both structure and attribute information has recently attracted considerable attention, since each node embedding is simply a unified low-dimension vector representation that makes downstream tasks e.g. link prediction more efficient and much easier to realize. Most of previous works have not considered the significant case of a network with incomplete structure information, which however, would often appear in our real-world scenarios e.g. the abnormal users in a social network who intentionally hide their friendships. And different networks obviously have different levels of incomplete structure information, which imposes more challenges to balance two sources of information. To tackle that, we propose a robust NE method called Attributed Biased Random Walks (ABRW) to employ attribute information for compensating incomplete structure information by using transition matrices. The experiments of link prediction and node classification tasks on real-world datasets confirm the robustness and effectiveness of our method to the different levels of the incomplete structure information.
