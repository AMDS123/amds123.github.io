##### Abstract
We present Lemotif. Lemotif generates a motif for your emotional life. You tell Lemotif a little bit about your day -- what were salient events or aspects and how they made you feel. Lemotif will generate a lemotif -- a creative abstract visual depiction of your emotions and their sources. Over time, Lemotif can create visual motifs to capture a summary of your emotional states over arbitrary periods of time -- making patterns in your emotions and their sources apparent, presenting opportunities to take actions, and measure their effectiveness. The underlying principles in Lemotif are that the lemotif should (1) separate out the sources of the emotions, (2) depict these sources visually, (3) depict the emotions visually, and (4) have a creative aspect to them. We verify via human studies that each of these factors contributes to the proposed lemotifs being favored over corresponding baselines.
