##### Abstract
Person re-identification aims to re-identify the probe image from a given set of images under different camera views. It is challenging due to large variations of pose, illumination, occlusion and camera view. Since the convolutional neural networks (CNN) have excellent capability of feature extraction, certain deep learning methods have been recently applied in person re-identification. However, in person re-identification, the deep networks often suffer from the over-fitting problem. In this paper, we propose a novel CNN-based method to learn a discriminative metric with good robustness to the over-fitting problem in person re-identification. Firstly, a novel deep architecture is built where the Mahalanobis metric is learned with a weight constraint. This weight constraint is used to regularize the learning, so that the learned metric has a better generalization ability. Secondly, we find that the selection of intra-class sample pairs is crucial for learning but has received little attention. To cope with the large intra-class variations in pedestrian images, we propose a novel training strategy named moderate positive mining to prevent the training process from over-fitting to the extreme samples in intra-class pairs. Experiments show that our approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods on several benchmarks of person re-identification.

人员重新识别的目的是在不同的摄像机视图下重新识别来自给定图像集合的探测图像。由于姿态，照明，遮挡和摄像机视图的大变化，这是具有挑战性的。由于卷积神经网络（CNN）具有很好的特征提取能力，因此最近有一些深度学习方法被应用于个人身份识别。然而，在个人重新识别中，深度网络往往遭受过度的挑战。在本文中，我们提出了一种新的基于CNN的方法来学习一个具有良好鲁棒性的判别性度量的过度拟合问题在人重新识别。首先，建立了一个新的深层架构，其中Mahalanobis度量是通过权重约束来学习的。这个权重约束被用来规范学习，所以学习的度量具有更好的泛化能力。其次，我们发现类内抽样对学习的选择对于学习至关重要，但很少受到关注。为了应对行人图像中的大类内部变化，我们提出了一种新的训练策略，称为中等正向挖掘，以防止训练过程从过度拟合到类内对的极端样本。实验表明，我们的方法在人重新识别的几个基准上明显优于最先进的方法。
