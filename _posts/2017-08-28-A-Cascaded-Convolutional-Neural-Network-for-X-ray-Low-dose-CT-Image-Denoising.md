##### Abstract
Image denoising techniques are essential to reducing noise levels and enhancing diagnosis reliability in low-dose computed tomography (CT). Machine learning based denoising methods have shown great potential in removing the complex and spatial-variant noises in CT images. However, some residue artifacts would appear in the denoised image due to complexity of noises. A cascaded training network was proposed in this work, where the trained CNN was applied on the training dataset to initiate new trainings and remove artifacts induced by denoising. A cascades of convolutional neural networks (CNN) were built iteratively to achieve better performance with simple CNN structures. Experiments were carried out on 2016 Low-dose CT Grand Challenge datasets to evaluate the method's performance.

图像去噪技术对于降低低剂量计算机断层扫描（CT）中的噪声水平和提高诊断可靠性至关重要。基于机器学习的去噪方法在消除CT图像中的复杂和空间变化的噪声方面显示出巨大的潜力。然而，由于噪声的复杂性，在去噪图像中会出现一些残留伪像。本文提出了一个级联的训练网络，将训练好的CNN应用到训练数据集上，开始新的训练，消除由去噪引起的伪影。卷积神经网络（CNN）的级联迭代建立，以获得更好的性能与简单的CNN结构。在2016年低剂量CT Grand Challenge数据集上进行了实验，以评估该方法的性能。
