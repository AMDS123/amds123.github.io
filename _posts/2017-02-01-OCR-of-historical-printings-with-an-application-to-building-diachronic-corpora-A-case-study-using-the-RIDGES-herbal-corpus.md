##### Abstract
This article describes the results of a case study that applies Neural Network-based Optical Character Recognition (OCR) to scanned images of books printed between 1487 and 1870 by training the OCR engine OCRopus [@breuel2013high] on the RIDGES herbal text corpus [@OdebrechtEtAlSubmitted]. Training specific OCR models was possible because the necessary *ground truth* is available as error-corrected diplomatic transcriptions. The OCR results have been evaluated for accuracy against the ground truth of unseen test sets. Character and word accuracies (percentage of correctly recognized items) for the resulting machine-readable texts of individual documents range from 94% to more than 99% (character level) and from 76% to 97% (word level). This includes the earliest printed books, which were thought to be inaccessible by OCR methods until recently. Furthermore, OCR models trained on one part of the corpus consisting of books with different printing dates and different typesets *(mixed models)* have been tested for their predictive power on the books from the other part containing yet other fonts, mostly yielding character accuracies well above 90%. It therefore seems possible to construct generalized models trained on a range of fonts that can be applied to a wide variety of historical printings still giving good results. A moderate postcorrection effort of some pages will then enable the training of individual models with even better accuracies. Using this method, diachronic corpora including early printings can be constructed much faster and cheaper than by manual transcription. The OCR methods reported here open up the possibility of transforming our printed textual cultural heritage into electronic text by largely automatic means, which is a prerequisite for the mass conversion of scanned books.

本文描述了一个案例研究的结果，该案例研究通过在RIDGES中草药文本语料库上训练OCR引擎OCRopus [@ breuel2013high]，将神经网络光学字符识别（OCR）应用于1487年至1870年之间印刷的书籍的扫描图像[@OdebrechtEtAlSubmitted ]。培训具体的OCR模型是可能的，因为必要的*基础事实*可用作纠错外交转录。 OCR结果已经被评估为与未见的测试集的基本事实相对的准确性。单个文档的机器可读文本的字符和单词精度（正确识别项目的百分比）范围从94％到99％（字符级别）和76％到97％（字级）。这包括最早的印刷书籍，直到最近才被OCR方法认为是无法访问的。此外，在包含不同印刷日期和不同排版*（混合模型）*的书籍的语料库的一部分上训练的OCR模型已经经过了对来自包含其他字体的其他部分的书籍的预测能力的测试，其中主要产生字符准确性远高于90％。因此，似乎有可能建立一系列广泛的模型，可以应用于各种各样的历史印刷，仍然给予好的结果。稍微纠正一些页面的工作量后，就可以对单个模型进行更精确的训练。使用这种方法，包括早期印刷的历时语料库可以比手动转录更快，更便宜地构建。这里所报告的OCR方法开辟了以大部分自动化手段将我们印刷的文本文化遗产转换成电子文本的可能性，这是大规模转换扫描书籍的先决条件。
