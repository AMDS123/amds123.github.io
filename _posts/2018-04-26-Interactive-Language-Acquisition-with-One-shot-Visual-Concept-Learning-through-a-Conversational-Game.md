##### Abstract
Building intelligent agents that can communicate with and learn from humans in natural language is of great value. Supervised language learning is limited by the ability of capturing mainly the statistics of training data, and is hardly adaptive to new scenarios or flexible for acquiring new knowledge without inefficient retraining or catastrophic forgetting. We highlight the perspective that conversational interaction serves as a natural interface both for language learning and for novel knowledge acquisition and propose a joint imitation and reinforcement approach for grounded language learning through an interactive conversational game. The agent trained with this approach is able to actively acquire information by asking questions about novel objects and use the just-learned knowledge in subsequent conversations in a one-shot fashion. Results compared with other methods verified the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

建立能够以自然语言与人交流并向人类学习的智能代理是非常有价值的。受监督的语言学习受到主要捕捉训练数据统计的能力的限制，并且难以适应新的场景或灵活获取新知识，而没有低效的再训练或灾难性遗忘。我们强调对话交互作为语言学习和新知识获取的自然界面的视角，并提出联合模仿和强化方法，通过交互式会话游戏进行基础语言学习。使用这种方法进行培训的代理人可以通过询问有关新颖物体的问题来主动获取信息，并在随后的对话中以一次性方式使用刚才学到的知识。结果与其他方法相比，验证了所提出方法的有效性。
