##### Abstract
To assure that an autonomous car is driving safely on public roads, its object detection module should not only work correctly, but show its prediction confidence as well. Previous object detectors driven by deep learning do not explicitly model uncertainties in the neural network. We tackle with this problem by presenting practical methods to capture uncertainties in a 3D vehicle detector for Lidar point clouds. The proposed probabilistic detector represents reliable epistemic uncertainty and aleatoric uncertainty in classification and localization tasks. Experimental results show that the epistemic uncertainty is related to the detection accuracy, whereas the aleatoric uncertainty is influenced by vehicle distance and occlusion. The results also show that we can improve the detection performance by 1%-5% by modeling the aleatoric uncertainty.

为了确保自动驾驶汽车在公共道路上安全行驶，其物体检测模块不仅应该正常工作，还要显示其预测信心。由深度学习驱动的先前物体检测器不明确地模拟神经网络中的不确定性。我们通过提出实用方法来捕捉激光雷达点云的3D车辆探测器中的不确定性来解决这个问题。所提出的概率检测器代表了分类和定位任务中可靠的认知不确定性和任意不确定性。实验结果表明，认知不确定性与检测精度有关，而任意不确定性受车辆距离和遮挡的影响。结果还表明，通过对任意不确定性进行建模，我们可以将检测性能提高1％-5％。
