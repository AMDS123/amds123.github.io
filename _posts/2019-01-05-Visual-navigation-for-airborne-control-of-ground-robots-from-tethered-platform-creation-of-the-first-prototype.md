##### Abstract
We propose control systems for the coordination of the ground robots. We develop robot efficient coordination using the devices located on towers or a tethered aerial apparatus tracing the robots on controlled area and supervising their environment including natural and artificial markings. The simple prototype of such a system was created in the Laboratory of Applied Mathematics of Ariel University (under the supervision of Prof. Domoshnitsky Alexander) in collaboration with company TRANSIST VIDEO LLC (Skolkovo, Moscow). We plan to create much more complicated prototype using Kamin grant (Israel)
