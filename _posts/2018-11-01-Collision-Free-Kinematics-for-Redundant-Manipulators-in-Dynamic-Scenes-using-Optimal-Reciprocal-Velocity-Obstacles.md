##### Abstract
We present a novel algorithm for collision-free manipulation of multiple manipulators in a shared workspace with moving obstacles. Our optimization-based approach simultaneously handles collision-free constraints based on reciprocal velocity obstacles and inverse kinematics constraints. We present an efficient method based on particle swarm optimization that can generate collision-free configurations for each redundant manipulator. Furthermore, our approach can be used to compute safe and oscillation-free trajectories. We highlight the real-time performance of our algorithm on multiple Baxter robots with 14-DOF manipulators operating in a workspace with dynamic obstacles.
