##### Abstract
Since the introduction of Direct Electron Detectors (DEDs), the resolution and range of macromolecules amenable to this technique has significantly widened, generating a broad interest that explains the well over a dozen reviews in top journal in the last two years. Similarly, the number of job offers to lead EM groups and/or coordinate EM facilities has exploded, and FEI (the main microscope manufacturer for Life Sciences) has received more than 100 orders of high-end electron microscopes by summer 2016. Strategic corporate movements are also happening, with very big players entering the market through key acquisitions (Thermo Fisher has recently bought FEI for \$4.2B), partly attracted by new Pharma interest in the field, now perceived to be in a position to impact structure-based drug design. The scientific perspectives are indeed extremely positive but, in these moments of well-founded generalized optimists, we want to make a reflection on some of the hurdles ahead us, since they certainly exist and they indeed limit the informational content of cryoEM projects. Here we focus on image processing aspects, particularly in the so-called area of Single Particle Analysis, discussing some of the current resolution and high-throughput limiting factors.

##### Abstract (translated by Google)
自推出直接电子探测器（DEDs）以来，适用于该技术的大分子的分辨率和范围已经显着扩大，引起了广泛的兴趣，这解释了过去两年在顶级期刊上十多篇评论。同样，领导EM团队和/或协调EM设备的工作机会数量已经激增，FEI（生命科学主要显微镜制造商）已经在2016年夏季获得了超过100台高端电子显微镜订单。战略性企业运动也正在发生，通过关键收购，有很大的玩家进入市场（赛默飞世界最近以42亿美元的价格收购了FEI），部分被新的制药公司在该领域的兴趣所吸引，现在被认为能够影响基于结构的药物设计。科学的观点确实是非常积极的，但是在这些有充分根据的广义乐观主义者的时刻，我们想要反思我们面前的一些障碍，因为它们确实存在，并且确实限制了cryoEM项目的信息内容。在这里，我们专注于图像处理方面，特别是在所谓的单粒子分析领域，讨论一些当前的分辨率和高通量的限制因素。
