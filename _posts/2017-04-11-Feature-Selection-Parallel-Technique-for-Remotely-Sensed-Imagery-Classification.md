##### Abstract
Remote sensing research focusing on feature selection has long attracted the attention of the remote sensing community because feature selection is a prerequisite for image processing and various applications. Different feature selection methods have been proposed to improve the classification accuracy. They vary from basic search techniques to clonal selections, and various optimal criteria have been investigated. Recently, methods using dependence-based measures have attracted much attention due to their ability to deal with very high dimensional datasets. However, these methods are based on Cramers V test, which has performance issues with large datasets. In this paper, we propose a parallel approach to improve their performance. We evaluate our approach on hyper-spectral and high spatial resolution images and compare it to the proposed methods with a centralized version as preliminary results. The results are very promising.

以特征选择为重点的遥感研究早已引起了遥感界的关注，因为特征选择是图像处理和各种应用的先决条件。已经提出了不同的特征选择方法来提高分类精度。它们从基本的搜索技术到克隆选择都不相同，并且已经研究了各种最佳标准。最近，使用基于依赖的度量方法由于能够处理非常高维的数据集而引起了很多关注。但是，这些方法基于Cramers V测试，对大数据集有性能问题。在本文中，我们提出了一个并行的方法来提高他们的表现。我们评估我们的方法在高光谱和高空间分辨率图像，并将其与所提出的方法作为初步结果进行比较。结果非常有希望。
