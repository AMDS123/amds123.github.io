##### Abstract
In this paper, a method is proposed to detect the emotion of a song based on its lyrical and audio features. Lyrical features are generated by segmentation of lyrics during the process of data extraction. ANEW and WordNet knowledge is then incorporated to compute Valence and Arousal values. In addition to this, linguistic association rules are applied to ensure that the issue of ambiguity is properly addressed. Audio features are used to supplement the lyrical ones and include attributes like energy, tempo, and danceability. These features are extracted from The Echo Nest, a widely used music intelligence platform. Construction of training and test sets is done on the basis of social tags extracted from the last.fm website. The classification is done by applying feature weighting and stepwise threshold reduction on the k-Nearest Neighbors algorithm to provide fuzziness in the classification.

##### Abstract (translated by Google)
本文提出了一种基于抒情和音频特征来检测歌曲情感的方法。在数据提取的过程中，歌词的分割会产生歌词的抒情特征。然后纳入ANEW和WordNet知识来计算价值和唤醒值。除此之外，还应用语言关联规则来确保解决歧义问题。音频功能是用来补充抒情的功能，包括能源，节奏，舞蹈等属性。这些功能是从广泛使用的音乐智能平台Echo Nest中提取的。训练和测试集的构建基于从last.fm网站提取的社交标签进行。通过对k-最近邻算法应用特征加权和逐步阈值降低来进行分类以提供分类中的模糊性。
