##### Abstract
We study multiview moduli problems that arise in computer vision. We show that these moduli spaces are always smooth and irreducible, in both the calibrated and uncalibrated cases, for any number of views. We also show that these moduli spaces always admit open immersions into Hilbert schemes for more than two views, extending and refining work of Aholt-Sturmfels-Thomas. We use these moduli spaces to study and extend the classical twisted pair covering of the essential variety.
