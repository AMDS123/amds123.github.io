##### Abstract
Automatic continuous time, continuous value assessment of a patient's pain from face video is highly sought after by the medical profession. Despite the recent advances in deep learning that attain impressive results in many domains, pain estimation risks not being able to benefit from this due to the difficulty in obtaining data sets of considerable size. In this work we propose a combination of hand-crafted and deep-learned features that makes the most of deep learning techniques in small sample settings. Encoding shape, appearance, and dynamics, our method significantly outperforms the current state of the art, attaining a RMSE error of less than 1 point on a 16-level pain scale, whilst simultaneously scoring a 67.3% Pearson correlation coefficient between our predicted pain level time series and the ground truth.

自动连续的时间，从面部视频的病人痛苦的持续价值评估是医疗界高度追捧。尽管最近深度学习在许多领域取得了令人印象深刻的成果，但由于难以获得相当规模的数据集，疼痛估计风险无法从中受益。在这项工作中，我们提出了手工制作和深度学习功能的组合，在小样本设置中充分利用深度学习技术。编码的形状，外观和动态，我们的方法显着优于当前的技术水平，达到16级疼痛量表上小于1分的RMSE误差，同时得分在我们预测的疼痛水平之间的67.3％的皮尔逊相关系数时间序列和事实真相。
