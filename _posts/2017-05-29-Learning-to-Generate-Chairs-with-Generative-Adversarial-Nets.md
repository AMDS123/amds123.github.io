##### Abstract
Generative adversarial networks (GANs) has gained tremendous popularity lately due to an ability to reinforce quality of its predictive model with generated objects and the quality of the generative model with and supervised feedback. GANs allow to synthesize images with a high degree of realism. However, the learning process of such models is a very complicated optimization problem and certain limitation for such models were found. It affects the choice of certain layers and nonlinearities when designing architectures. In particular, it does not allow to train convolutional GAN models with fully-connected hidden layers. In our work, we propose a modification of the previously described set of rules, as well as new approaches to designing architectures that will allow us to train more powerful GAN models. We show the effectiveness of our methods on the problem of synthesizing projections of 3D objects with the possibility of interpolation by class and view point.

生成对抗网络（GAN）最近获得了巨大的普及，因为它能够通过生成对象来强化其预测模型的质量，并且通过监督反馈来生成生成模型的质量。 GAN允许以高度真实性合成图像。然而，这些模型的学习过程是一个非常复杂的优化问题，并且发现了这种模型的一些限制。它在设计架构时会影响到某些层次的选择和非线性。特别是，它不允许训练具有完全连接的隐藏层的卷积GAN模型。在我们的工作中，我们提出了对前面描述的一套规则的修改，以及设计架构的新方法，这将使我们能够训练更强大的GAN模型。我们展示了我们的方法在合成三维物体的投影的问题上的有效性，以及通过类和视点的插值的可能性。
