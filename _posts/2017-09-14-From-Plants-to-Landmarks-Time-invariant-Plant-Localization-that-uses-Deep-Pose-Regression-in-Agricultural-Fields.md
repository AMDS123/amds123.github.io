##### Abstract
Agricultural robots are expected to increase yields in a sustainable way and automate precision tasks, such as weeding and plant monitoring. At the same time, they move in a continuously changing, semi-structured field environment, in which features can hardly be found and reproduced at a later time. Challenges for Lidar and visual detection systems stem from the fact that plants can be very small, overlapping and have a steadily changing appearance. Therefore, a popular way to localize vehicles with high accuracy is based on ex- pensive global navigation satellite systems and not on natural landmarks. The contribution of this work is a novel image- based plant localization technique that uses the time-invariant stem emerging point as a reference. Our approach is based on a fully convolutional neural network that learns landmark localization from RGB and NIR image input in an end-to-end manner. The network performs pose regression to generate a plant location likelihood map. Our approach allows us to cope with visual variances of plants both for different species and different growth stages. We achieve high localization accuracies as shown in detailed evaluations of a sugar beet cultivation phase. In experiments with our BoniRob we demonstrate that detections can be robustly reproduced with centimeter accuracy.

预计农业机器人将以可持续的方式提高产量，并使诸如除草和植物监测等精确任务自动化。与此同时，它们在一个不断变化，半结构化的现场环境中移动，在这个环境中，特征很难被发现和再现。激光雷达和视觉检测系统面临的挑战源于这样一个事实，即植物可以非常小，重叠并且外观稳定变化。因此，高度精确地定位车辆的流行方式是基于高昂的全球导航卫星系统而不是自然地标。这项工作的贡献是一个新颖的基于图像的植物定位技术，使用时间不变茎干点作为参考。我们的方法是基于完全卷积神经网络，从端到端的方式学习RGB和NIR图像输入的地标定位。网络执行姿态回归以生成植物位置可能性图。我们的方法使我们能够应对不同物种和不同生长阶段植物的视觉差异。如甜菜种植阶段的详细评估所示，我们实现了高定位精度。在我们的BoniRob的实验中，我们证明了检测能够以厘米级的精度进行稳健的再现。
