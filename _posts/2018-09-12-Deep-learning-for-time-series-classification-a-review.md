##### Abstract
Time Series Classification (TSC) is an important and challenging problem in data mining. With the increase of time series data availability, hundreds of TSC algorithms have been proposed. Among these methods, only a few have considered Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) to perform this task. This is surprising as deep learning has seen very successful applications in the last years. DNNs have indeed revolutionized the field of computer vision especially with the advent of novel deeper architectures such as Residual and Convolutional Neural Networks. Apart from images, sequential data such as text and audio can also be processed with DNNs to reach state of the art performance for document classification and speech recognition. In this article, we study the current state of the art performance of deep learning algorithms for TSC by presenting an empirical study of the most recent DNN architectures for TSC. We give an overview of the most successful deep learning applications in various time series domains under a unified taxonomy of DNNs for TSC. We also provide an open source deep learning framework to the TSC community where we implemented each of the compared approaches and evaluated them on a univariate TSC benchmark (the UCR archive) and 12 multivariate time series datasets. By training 8,730 deep learning models on 97 time series datasets, we propose the most exhaustive study of DNNs for TSC to date.

时间序列分类（TSC）是数据挖掘中一个重要且具有挑战性的问题。随着时间序列数据可用性的增加，已经提出了数百种TSC算法。在这些方法中，只有少数人考虑过深度神经网络（DNN）来执行此任务。这是令人惊讶的，因为深度学习在过去几年中已经取得了非常成功的应用。 DNN确实彻底改变了计算机视觉领域，特别是随着新的更深层架构的出现，如残余和卷积神经网络。除了图像之外，还可以使用DNN处理诸如文本和音频之类的顺序数据，以达到用于文档分类和语音识别的最先进性能。在本文中，我们通过对TSC最新DNN架构的实证研究，研究了TSC深度学习算法的当前最先进性能。我们概述了在统一的TSN分类标准下，TSC的各个时间序列域中最成功的深度学习应用程序。我们还为TSC社区提供了一个开源深度学习框架，我们在其中实施了每种比较方法，并在单变量TSC基准测试（UCR存档）和12个多变量时间序列数据集上进行评估。通过在97个时间序列数据集上训练8,730个深度学习模型，我们提出了迄今为止对TSC进行最详尽的DNN研究。
