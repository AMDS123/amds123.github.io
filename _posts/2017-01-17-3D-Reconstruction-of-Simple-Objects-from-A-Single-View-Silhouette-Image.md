##### Abstract
While recent deep neural networks have achieved promising results for 3D reconstruction from a single-view image, these rely on the availability of RGB textures in images and extra information as supervision. In this work, we propose novel stacked hierarchical networks and an end to end training strategy to tackle a more challenging task for the first time, 3D reconstruction from a single-view 2D silhouette image. We demonstrate that our model is able to conduct 3D reconstruction from a single-view silhouette image both qualitatively and quantitatively. Evaluation is performed using Shapenet for the single-view reconstruction and results are presented in comparison with a single network, to highlight the improvements obtained with the proposed stacked networks and the end to end training strategy. Furthermore, 3D re- construction in forms of IoU is compared with the state of art 3D reconstruction from a single-view RGB image, and the proposed model achieves higher IoU than the state of art of reconstruction from a single view RGB image.

尽管最近的深度神经网络从单视图图像中获得了有希望的三维重建结果，但是这些依赖于图像中的RGB纹理的可用性和作为监督的额外信息。在这项工作中，我们提出了新的堆叠层次网络和端到端的训练策略，以首次应对更具挑战性的任务，从单视图2D轮廓图像进行3D重建。我们证明，我们的模型能够从定性和定量的单视图轮廓图像进行三维重建。使用Shapenet进行单视图重建评估，并将结果与​​单个网络进行比较，以突出所提议的堆叠网络和端到端培训策略所获得的改进。此外，将IoU形式的3D重构与单视图RGB图像的现有技术三维重建进行比较，并且所提出的模型比单视图RGB图像的重建技术状态实现更高的IoU。
