##### Abstract
One of the most straightforward, direct and efficient approaches to Image Segmentation is Image Thresholding. Multi-level Image Thresholding is an essential viewpoint in many image processing and Pattern Recognition based real-time applications which can effectively and efficiently classify the pixels into various groups denoting multiple regions in an Image. Thresholding based Image Segmentation using fuzzy entropy combined with intelligent optimization approaches are commonly used direct methods to properly identify the thresholds so that they can be used to segment an Image accurately. In this paper a novel approach for multi-level image thresholding is proposed using Type II Fuzzy sets combined with Adaptive Plant Propagation Algorithm (APPA). Obtaining the optimal thresholds for an image by maximizing the entropy is extremely tedious and time consuming with increase in the number of thresholds. Hence, Adaptive Plant Propagation Algorithm (APPA), a memetic algorithm based on plant intelligence, is used for fast and efficient selection of optimal thresholds. This fact is reasonably justified by comparing the accuracy of the outcomes and computational time consumed by other modern state-of-the-art algorithms such as Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), Gravitational Search Algorithm (GSA) and Genetic Algorithm (GA).

图像分割最直接，最直接，最有效的方法之一就是图像阈值分割。多级图像阈值处理是许多基于图像处理和基于模式识别的实时应用的基本观点，能够将图像中的像素有效且高效地分类为表示多个区域的多个组。基于阈值的图像分割使用模糊熵结合智能优化的方法是常用的直接方法来正确识别阈值，以便它们可以用来精确地分割图像。本文提出了一种结合自适应植物繁殖算法（APPA）的II型模糊集的多级图像阈值分割方法。通过使熵最大化来获得图像的最佳阈值是非常繁琐且耗时的，随着阈值的数量的增加。因此，自适应植物繁殖算法（APPA）是一种基于植物智能的模因算法，用于快速高效地选择最佳阈值。通过比较粒子群优化（PSO），引力搜索算法（GSA）和遗传算法（GA）等其他现代先进算法所消耗的结果的准确性和计算时间，可以合理地证明这一点。
