##### Abstract
Crop diseases are a major threat to food security, but their rapid identification remains difficult in many parts of the world due to the lack of the necessary infrastructure. The combination of increasing global smartphone penetration and recent advances in computer vision made possible by deep learning has paved the way for smartphone-assisted disease diagnosis. Using a public dataset of 54,306 images of diseased and healthy plant leaves collected under controlled conditions, we train a deep convolutional neural network to identify 14 crop species and 26 diseases (or absence thereof). The trained model achieves an accuracy of 99.35% on a held-out test set, demonstrating the feasibility of this approach. When testing the model on a set of images collected from trusted online sources - i.e. taken under conditions different from the images used for training - the model still achieves an accuracy of 31.4%. While this accuracy is much higher than the one based on random selection (2.6%), a more diverse set of training data is needed to improve the general accuracy. Overall, the approach of training deep learning models on increasingly large and publicly available image datasets presents a clear path towards smartphone-assisted crop disease diagnosis on a massive global scale.

作物病害是对粮食安全的主要威胁，但由于缺乏必要的基础设施，在世界许多地区仍然难以快速识别。全球智能手机普及率的提高和近期计算机视觉的进步使得深度学习成为可能，这为智能手机辅助疾病诊断铺平了道路。使用患病和健康植物的54306个图像控制的条件下收集的叶的公共数据集，我们培养了深刻的卷积神经网络，以确定14个作物物种和26种疾病（或其不存在）。经过训练的模型在一个外挂测试集上达到了99.35％的准确度，证明了这种方法的可行性。即，从用于训练图像中的不同条件下拍摄 -   - 当在一组来自可信在线来源收集的图像的测试模型的模型仍然实现了31.4％的准确度。虽然这个精度比基于随机选择（2.6％）的精度高得多，但需要更多不同的训练数据来提高总体精度。总体而言，对日益庞大且可公开获得的图像数据组的训练深度学习模型的方式呈现在庞大的全球范围内对智能手机辅助农作物疾病诊断明确的路径。
