##### Abstract
Artificial Intelligence (AI) technology is rapidly changing many areas of society. While there is tremendous potential in this transition, there are several pitfalls as well. Using the history of computing and the world-wide web as a guide, in this article we identify those pitfalls and actions that lead AI development to its full potential. If done right, AI will be instrumental in achieving the goals we set for economy, society, and the world in general.
