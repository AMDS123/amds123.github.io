##### Abstract
An understanding of pedestrians dynamics is indispensable for numerous urban applications including the design of transportation networks and planing for business development. Pedestrian counting often requires utilizing manual or technical means to count individual pedestrians in each location of interest. However, such methods do not scale to the size of a city and a new approach to fill this gap is here proposed. In this project, we used a large dense dataset of images of New York City along with deep learning and computer vision techniques to construct a spatio-temporal map of relative pedestrian density. Due to the limitations of state of the art computer vision methods, such automatic detection of pedestrians is inherently subject to errors. We model these errors as a probabilistic process, for which we provide theoretical analysis and through numerical simulations. We demonstrate that, within our assumptions, our methodology can supply a reasonable estimate of pedestrian densities and provide theoretical bounds for the resulting error.
