##### Abstract
Brain CT has become a standard imaging tool for emergent evaluation of brain condition, and measurement of midline shift (MLS) is one of the most important features to address for brain CT assessment. We present a simple method to estimate MLS and propose a new alternative parameter to MLS: the ratio of MLS over the maximal width of intracranial region (MLS/ICWMAX). Three neurosurgeons and our automated system were asked to measure MLS and MLS/ICWMAX in the same sets of axial CT images obtained from 41 patients admitted to ICU under neurosurgical service. A weighted midline (WML) was plotted based on individual pixel intensities, with higher weighted given to the darker portions. The MLS could then be measured as the distance between the WML and ideal midline (IML) near the foramen of Monro. The average processing time to output an automatic MLS measurement was around 10 seconds. Our automated system achieved an overall accuracy of 90.24% when the CT images were calibrated automatically, and performed better when the calibrations of head rotation were done manually (accuracy: 92.68%). MLS/ICWMAX and MLS both gave results in same confusion matrices and produced similar ROC curve results. We demonstrated a simple, fast and accurate automated system of MLS measurement and introduced a new parameter (MLS/ICWMAX) as a good alternative to MLS in terms of estimating the degree of brain deformation, especially when non-DICOM images (e.g. JPEG) are more easily accessed.

脑CT已经成为大脑条件紧急评估的标准成像工具，中线偏移（MLS）测量是脑CT评估最重要的特征之一。我们提出一个简单的方法来估计MLS，并提出一个新的替代参数MLS：MLS的最大宽度的颅内区（MLS / ICWMAX）的比例。三名神经外科医生和我们的自动化系统被要求在同一组轴向CT图像中测量MLS和MLS / ICWMAX，这些CT图像来自41名在神经外科服务中入住ICU的患者。加权中线（WML）是基于单个像素强度绘制的，对较暗的部分赋予较高的权重。然后可以测量MLS作为WML和Monro孔附近的理想中线（IML）之间的距离。输出自动MLS测量的平均处理时间约为10秒。当自动校准CT图像时，我们的自动化系统达到了90.24％的总体精度，并且在手动校正头部旋转（准确度：92.68％）时表现更好。 MLS / ICWMAX和MLS都给出了相同混淆矩阵的结果，并产生了类似的ROC曲线结果。我们演示了一个简单，快速，准确的MLS自动测量系统，并且在估计大脑变形程度方面引入了一个新的参数（MLS / ICWMAX）作为MLS的一个很好的替代方法，特别是当非DICOM图像（如JPEG）更容易访问。
