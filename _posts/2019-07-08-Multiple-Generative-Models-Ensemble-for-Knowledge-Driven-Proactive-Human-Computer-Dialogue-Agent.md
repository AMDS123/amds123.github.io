##### Abstract
Multiple sequence to sequence models were used to establish an end-to-end multi-turns proactive dialogue generation agent, with the aid of data augmentation techniques and variant encoder-decoder structure designs. A rank-based ensemble approach was developed for boosting performance. Results indicate that our single model, in average, makes an obvious improvement in the terms of F1-score and BLEU over the baseline by 18.67% on the DuConv dataset. In particular, the ensemble methods further significantly outperform the baseline by 35.85%.
