##### Abstract
Image dehazing deals with the removal of undesired loss of visibility in outdoor images due to the presence of fog. Retinex is a color vision model mimicking the ability of the Human Visual System to robustly discount varying illuminations when observing a scene under different spectral lighting conditions. Retinex has been widely explored in the computer vision literature for image enhancement and other related tasks. While these two problems are apparently unrelated, the goal of this work is to show that they can be connected by a simple linear relationship. Specifically, most Retinex-based algorithms have the characteristic feature of always increasing image brightness, which turns them into ideal candidates for effective image dehazing by directly applying Retinex to a hazy image whose intensities have been inverted. In this paper, we give theoretical proof that Retinex on inverted intensities is a solution to the image dehazing problem. Comprehensive qualitative and quantitative results indicate that several classical and modern implementations of Retinex can be transformed into competing image dehazing algorithms performing on pair with more complex fog removal methods, and can overcome some of the main challenges associated with this problem.

图像去雾处理是由于雾的存在而消除了在室外图像中不希望的能见度损失。 Retinex是一种色彩视觉模型，它模拟人类视觉系统在不同光谱照明条件下观察场景时强烈折射不同照明的能力。在计算机视觉文献中，Retinex已经被广泛用于图像增强和其他相关任务。虽然这两个问题显然是不相关的，但这项工作的目标是证明它们可以通过简单的线性关系相连。具体而言，大多数基于Retinex的算法具有总是增加图像亮度的特征，通过将Retinex直接应用于强度已经颠倒的朦胧图像，这使得它们成为有效图像去雾的理想候选者。在本文中，我们给出了反演强度Retinex是解决图像去雾问题的理论证明。全面的定性和定量结果表明，Retinex的几个经典和现代实现可以转化为与更复杂的除雾方法配对执行的竞争图像去雾算法，并且可以克服与这个问题相关的一些主要挑战。
