##### Abstract
Slow acquisition has been one of the historical problems in dynamic magnetic resonance imaging (dMRI), but the rise of compressed sensing (CS) has brought numerous algorithms that successfully achieve high acceleration rates. While CS proposes random sampling for data acquisition, practical CS applications to dMRI have typically relied on random variable-density (VD) sampling patterns, where masks are drawn from probabilistic models, which preferably sample from the center of the Fourier domain. In contrast to this model-driven approach, we propose the first data-driven, scalable framework for optimizing sampling patterns in dMRI. Through a greedy algorithm, this approach allows the data to directly govern the search for a mask that exhibits good empirical performance. Previous greedy approach, designed for static MRI, required very intensive computations, prohibiting their direct application to dMRI, and we address this issue by resorting to a stochastic greedy algorithm that exploits only a fraction of resources compared to the previous approach without sacrificing the reconstruction accuracy. A thorough comparison on in vivo datasets shows the inefficiency of model-based approaches in terms of sampling performance and suggests that our data-driven sampling approach could fully enable the potential of CS applied to dMRI.
