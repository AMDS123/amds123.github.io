##### Abstract
We explore the factors influencing the dependence of single sentences on their larger textual context in order to automatically identify candidate sentences for language learning exercises from corpora which are presentable in isolation. An in-depth investigation of this question has not been previously carried out. Understanding this aspect can contribute to a more efficient selection of candidate sentences which, besides reducing the time required for item writing, can also ensure a higher degree of variability and authenticity. We present a set of relevant aspects collected based on the qualitative analysis of a smaller set of context-dependent corpus example sentences. Furthermore, we implemented a rule-based algorithm using these criteria which achieved an average precision of 0.76 for the identification of different issues related to context dependence. The method has also been evaluated empirically where 80% of the sentences in which our system did not detect context-dependent elements were also considered context-independent by human raters.

我们探讨影响单个句子对其较大文本语境的依赖的因素，以便从语料库中自动识别语言学习练习的候选句子，这些句子是孤立的。以前还没有对这个问题进行过深入的调查。了解这个方面可以有助于更有效地选择候选句子，除了减少项目写作所需的时间外，还可以确保更高程度的可变性和真实性。我们提出了一套相关的方面收集的基础上定性分析一个较小的上下文依赖语料库的例句。此外，我们使用这些标准实现了一个基于规则的算法，其平均精度为0.76，用于识别与上下文相关的不同问题。该方法也经过了经验性的评估，其中我们的系统中没有检测到依赖于上下文的元素的80％的句子也被人类评估者视为上下文无关的。
