##### Abstract
We introduce MilkQA, a question answering dataset from the dairy domain dedicated to the study of consumer questions. The dataset contains 2,657 pairs of questions and answers, written in the Portuguese language and originally collected by the Brazilian Agricultural Research Corporation (Embrapa). All questions were motivated by real situations and written by thousands of authors with very different backgrounds and levels of literacy, while answers were elaborated by specialists from Embrapa's customer service. Our dataset was filtered and anonymized by three human annotators. Consumer questions are a challenging kind of question that is usually employed as a form of seeking information. Although several question answering datasets are available, most of such resources are not suitable for research on answer selection models for consumer questions. We aim to fill this gap by making MilkQA publicly available. We study the behavior of four answer selection models on MilkQA: two baseline models and two convolutional neural network archictetures. Our results show that MilkQA poses real challenges to computational models, particularly due to linguistic characteristics of its questions and to their unusually longer lengths. Only one of the experimented models gives reasonable results, at the cost of high computational requirements.

我们介绍MilkQA，这是一个来自乳品领域的问答数据集，致力于消费者问题的研究。数据集包含2,657对问题和答案，用葡萄牙文写成，最初由巴西农业研究公司（Embrapa）收集。所有问题都是出于真实情况的动机，由成千上万具有非常不同背景和水平的读写能力的作者撰写，而Embrapa的客户服务专家则详细解答了这些问题。我们的数据集被三个人类注释者过滤和匿名。消费者问题是一种具有挑战性的问题，通常被用作寻求信息的一种形式。虽然有几个问答数据集可用，但大多数此类资源不适合用于研究消费者问题的答案选择模型。我们的目标是通过公开提供MilkQA填补这个空白。我们研究了MilkQA上四个回答选择模型的行为：两个基线模型和两个卷积神经网络archictetures。我们的研究结果表明，MilkQA对计算模型提出了真正的挑战，特别是由于其问题的语言特征以及它们异常长的长度。只有一个实验模型给出合理的结果，代价是高计算量。
