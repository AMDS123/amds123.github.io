##### Abstract
This paper presents a new version of an oscillating error classifier that has added fixed value ranges through bands, for each column or feature of the input dataset. It is shown that some of the data can be correctly classified through using fixed value ranges only, while the rest can be classified by using the classifier technique. It also presents the classifier in terms of a biological model of neurons and neuron links.
