##### Abstract
In Computer-Supported learning, monitoring and engaging a group of learners is a complex task for teachers, especially when learners are working collaboratively: Are my students motivated? What kind of progress are they making? Should I intervene? Is my communication and the didactic design adapted to my students? Our hypothesis is that the analysis of natural language interactions between students, and between students and teachers, provide very valuable information and could be used to produce qualitative indicators to help teachers' decisions. We develop an automatic approach in three steps (1) to explore the discursive functions of messages in a CSCL platform, (2) to classify the messages automatically and (3) to evaluate correlations between discursive attitudes and other variables linked to the learning activity. Results tend to show that some types of discourse are correlated with a notion of Progress on the learning activities and the importance of emotive participation from the Teacher.

在计算机支持的学习中，监控和吸引一群学习者对于教师来说是一项复杂的工作，特别是当学习者通力合作时：我的学生是否有动力？他们取得了什么样的进步？我应该介入吗？我的沟通和教学设计是否适合我的学生？我们的假设是，分析学生之间以及学生和教师之间的自然语言交互，提供了非常有价值的信息，可以用来产生定性的指标来帮助教师做出决定。我们在三个步骤中开发一种自动方法（1），以探索CSCL平台中消息的话语功能，（2）自动分类消息，（3）评估话语态度和与学习活动相关的其他变量之间的相关性。结果往往表明，某些类型的话语与学习活动的进展概念以及教师情感参与的重要性相关。
