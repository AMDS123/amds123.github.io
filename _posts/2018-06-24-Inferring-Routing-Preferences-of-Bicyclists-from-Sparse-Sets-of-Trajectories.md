##### Abstract
Understanding the criteria that bicyclists apply when they choose their routes is crucial for planning new bicycle paths or recommending routes to bicyclists. This is becoming more and more important as city councils are becoming increasingly aware of limitations of the transport infrastructure and problems related to automobile traffic. Since different groups of cyclists have different preferences, however, searching for a single set of criteria is prone to failure. Therefore, in this paper, we present a new approach to classify trajectories recorded and shared by bicyclists into different groups and, for each group, to identify favored and unfavored road types. Based on these results we show how to assign weights to the edges of a graph representing the road network such that minimum-weight paths in the graph, which can be computed with standard shortest-path algorithms, correspond to adequate routes. Our method combines known algorithms for machine learning and the analysis of trajectories in an innovative way and, thereby, constitutes a new comprehensive solution for the problem of deriving routing preferences from initially unclassified trajectories. An important property of our method is that it yields reasonable results even if the given set of trajectories is sparse in the sense that it does not cover all segments of the cycle network.

了解自行车选手在选择自己的路线时适用的标准，对于规划新的自行车道或推荐骑自行车的人来说至关重要。随着市议会日益意识到交通基础设施的局限性和与汽车交通有关的问题，这变得越来越重要。然而，由于不同的骑车人群体具有不同的偏好，因此寻找单一标准集合很容易失败。因此，在本文中，我们提出了一种新方法，将自行车手记录并分享到不同组中的轨迹进行分类，并为每组确定偏好和不利道路类型。基于这些结果，我们将演示如何为表示道路网络的图的边缘分配权重，以便可以使用标准最短路径算法计算的图中的最小权重路径与适当的路径相对应。我们的方法结合了已知的机器学习算法和创新方式的轨迹分析，从而构成了从最初未分类的轨迹推导路由偏好问题的全面解决方案。我们方法的一个重要特性是，即使给定的一组轨迹是稀疏的，它不会覆盖循环网络的所有部分，它仍然会产生合理的结果。
