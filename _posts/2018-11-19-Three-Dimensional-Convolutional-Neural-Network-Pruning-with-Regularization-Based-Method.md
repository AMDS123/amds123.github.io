##### Abstract
In recent years, three-dimensional convolutional neural network (3D CNN) is intensively applied in video analysis and receives good performance. However, 3D CNN leads to massive computation and storage consumption, which hinders its deployment on mobile and embedded devices. In this paper, we propose a three-dimensional regularization-based pruning method to assign different regularization parameters to different weight groups based on their importance to the network. Experiments show that the proposed method outperforms other popular methods in this area.
