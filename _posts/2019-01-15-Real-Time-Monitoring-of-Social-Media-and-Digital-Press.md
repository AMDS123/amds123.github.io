##### Abstract
Talaia is a platform for monitoring social media and digital press. A configurable crawler gathers content with respect to user defined domains or topics. Crawled data is processed by means of the EliXa Sentiment Analysis system. A Django powered interface provides data visualization for a user-based analysis of the data. This paper presents the architecture of the system and describes in detail its different components. To prove the validity of the approach, two real use cases are accounted for: one in the cultural domain and one in the political domain. Evaluation for the sentiment analysis task in both scenarios is also provided, showing the capacity for domain adaptation.
