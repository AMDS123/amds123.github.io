##### Abstract
It has been shown that Chinese poems can be successfully generated by sequence-to-sequence neural models, particularly with the attention mechanism. A potential problem of this approach, however, is that neural models can only learn abstract rules, while poem generation is a highly creative process that involves not only rules but also innovations for which pure statistical models are not appropriate in principle. This work proposes a memory-augmented neural model for Chinese poem generation, where the neural model and the augmented memory work together to balance the requirements of linguistic accordance and aesthetic innovation, leading to innovative generations that are still rule-compliant. In addition, it is found that the memory mechanism provides interesting flexibility that can be used to generate poems with different styles.

已经表明，中国诗歌可以通过序列 - 序列神经模型成功生成，特别是在注意机制的情况下。然而，这种方法的一个潜在的问题是，神经模型只能学习抽象的规则，而诗的生成是一个高度创造性的过程，不仅涉及到规则，而且还包括纯粹的统计模型原则上不适用的创新。这项工作提出了一个中国诗歌生成的记忆增强神经模型，神经模型和增强记忆一起工作，以平衡语言顺应和审美创新的要求，从而导致创新的世代依然遵守规则。另外，发现记忆机制提供了有趣的灵活性，可用于生成不同风格的诗歌。
