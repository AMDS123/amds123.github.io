##### Abstract
Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is caused by a sudden trauma to the head that may result in hematomas and contusions and can lead to stroke or chronic disability. An accurate quantification of the lesion volumes and their locations is essential to understand the pathophysiology of TBI and its progression. In this paper, we propose a fully convolutional neural network (CNN) model to segment contusions and lesions from brain magnetic resonance (MR) images of patients with TBI. The CNN architecture proposed here was based on a state of the art CNN architecture from Google, called Inception. Using a 3-layer Inception network, lesions are segmented from multi-contrast MR images. When compared with two recent TBI lesion segmentation methods, one based on CNN (called DeepMedic) and another based on random forests, the proposed algorithm showed improved segmentation accuracy on images of 18 patients with mild to severe TBI. Using a leave-one-out cross validation, the proposed model achieved a median Dice of 0.75, which was significantly better (p&lt;0.01) than the two competing methods.

创伤性脑损伤（TBI）是由头部突然创伤引起的，可能导致血肿和挫伤，并可导致中风或慢性残疾。准确量化病变体积及其位置对于了解TBI的病理生理学及其进展至关重要。在本文中，我们提出了一个完全卷积神经网络（CNN）模型来分割TBI患者脑磁共振（MR）图像的挫伤和病变。这里提出的CNN架构基于Google最先进的CNN架构，名为Inception。使用3层起始网络，病变从多对比度MR图像分割。与最近两种基于CNN（称为DeepMedic）和另一种基于随机森林的TBI病变分割方法相比，该算法显示了18名轻度至重度TBI患者图像的分割准确性提高。使用留一交叉验证，所提出的模型实现中值Dice为0.75，这比两种竞争方法明显更好（p <0.01）。
