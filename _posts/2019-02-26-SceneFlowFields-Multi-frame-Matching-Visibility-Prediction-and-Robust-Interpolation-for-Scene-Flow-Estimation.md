##### Abstract
State-of-the-art scene flow algorithms pursue the conflicting targets of accuracy, run time, and robustness. With the successful concept of pixel-wise matching and sparse-to-dense interpolation, we push the limits of scene flow estimation. Avoiding strong assumptions on the domain or the problem yields a more robust algorithm. This algorithm is fast because we avoid explicit regularization during matching, which allows an efficient computation. Using image information from multiple time steps and explicit visibility prediction based on previous results, we achieve competitive performances on different data sets. Our contributions and results are evaluated in comparative experiments. Overall, we present an accurate scene flow algorithm that is faster and more generic than any individual benchmark leader.
