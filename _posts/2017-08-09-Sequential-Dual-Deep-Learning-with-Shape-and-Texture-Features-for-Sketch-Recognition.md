##### Abstract
Recognizing freehand sketches with high arbitrariness is greatly challenging. Most existing methods either ignore the geometric characteristics or treat sketches as handwritten characters with fixed structural ordering. Consequently, they can hardly yield high recognition performance even though sophisticated learning techniques are employed. In this paper, we propose a sequential deep learning strategy that combines both shape and texture features. A coded shape descriptor is exploited to characterize the geometry of sketch strokes with high flexibility, while the outputs of constitutional neural networks (CNN) are taken as the abstract texture feature. We develop dual deep networks with memorable gated recurrent units (GRUs), and sequentially feed these two types of features into the dual networks, respectively. These dual networks enable the feature fusion by another gated recurrent unit (GRU), and thus accurately recognize sketches invariant to stroke ordering. The experiments on the TU-Berlin data set show that our method outperforms the average of human and state-of-the-art algorithms even when significant shape and appearance variations occur.

认识到任意性高的手绘草图是非常具有挑战性的。大多数现有方法要么忽略几何特征，要么将草图作为具有固定结构排序的手写字符。因此，即使使用复杂的学习技术，也难以产生高的识别性能。在本文中，我们提出了一个结合形状和纹理特征的顺序深度学习策略。利用编码形状描述符以高灵活性描绘草图笔画的几何特征，将构成神经网络（CNN）的输出作为抽象纹理特征。我们开发了具有令人难忘门控循环单元（GRU）的双深度网络，并将这两种类型的特征分别顺序馈送到双网络中。这些双重网络可以通过另一门控循环单元（GRU）进行特征融合，从而准确地识别不受笔画排序影响的草图。 TU-Berlin数据集上的实验表明，即使在出现明显的形状和外观变化时，我们的方法也优于人类和最先进的算法的平均值。
