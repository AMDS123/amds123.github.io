##### Abstract
We present a system for generating song lyrics lines conditioned on the style of a specified artist. The system uses a variational autoencoder with artist embeddings. We propose the pre-training of artist embeddings with the representations learned by a CNN classifier, which is trained to predict artists based on MEL spectrograms of their song clips. This work is the first step towards combining audio and text modalities of songs for generating lyrics conditioned on the artist's style. Our preliminary results suggest that there is a benefit in initializing artists' embeddings with the representations learned by a spectrogram classifier.
