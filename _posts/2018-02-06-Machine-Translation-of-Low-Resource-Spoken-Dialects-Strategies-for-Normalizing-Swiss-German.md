##### Abstract
The goal of this work is to design a machine translation (MT) system for a low-resource family of dialects, collectively known as Swiss German, which are widely spoken in Switzerland but seldom written. We collected a significant number of parallel written resources to start with, up to a total of about 60k words. Moreover, we identified several other promising data sources for Swiss German. Then, we designed and compared three strategies for normalizing Swiss German input in order to address the regional diversity. We found that character-based neural MT was the best solution for text normalization. In combination with phrase-based statistical MT, our solution reached 36% BLEU score when translating from the Bernese dialect. This value, however, decreases as the testing data becomes more remote from the training one, geographically and topically. These resources and normalization techniques are a first step towards full MT of Swiss German dialects.

这项工作的目标是为方言资源少的家族设计机器翻译（MT）系统，统称为瑞士德语，在瑞士广泛使用，但很少被编写。我们收集了大量的平行书面资源，总共约6万字。此外，我们还为瑞士德语确定了其他几个有前途的数据源。然后，我们设计和比较了瑞士德语输入规范化的三个策略，以解决地区多样性问题。我们发现基于字符的神经MT是文本标准化的最佳解决方案。结合基于短语的统计机器翻译，我们的解决方案从伯尔尼方言翻译时达到了36％的BLEU得分。然而，这个值随着测试数据在地理上和局部上离开训练数据变得更远而减小。这些资源和规范化技术是迈向瑞士德语方言的第一步。
