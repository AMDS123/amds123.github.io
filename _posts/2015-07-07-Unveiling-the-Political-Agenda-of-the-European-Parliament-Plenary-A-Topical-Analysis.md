##### Abstract
This study analyzes political interactions in the European Parliament (EP) by considering how the political agenda of the plenary sessions has evolved over time and the manner in which Members of the European Parliament (MEPs) have reacted to external and internal stimuli when making Parliamentary speeches. It does so by considering the context in which speeches are made, and the content of those speeches. To detect latent themes in legislative speeches over time, speech content is analyzed using a new dynamic topic modeling method, based on two layers of matrix factorization. This method is applied to a new corpus of all English language legislative speeches in the EP plenary from the period 1999-2014. Our findings suggest that the political agenda of the EP has evolved significantly over time, is impacted upon by the committee structure of the Parliament, and reacts to exogenous events such as EU Treaty referenda and the emergence of the Euro-crisis have a significant impact on what is being discussed in Parliament.

这项研究分析了欧洲议会（EP）的政治互动，考虑了全体会议的政治议程如何随着时间的推移而变化，以及欧洲议会议员在议会发言时对外部和内部的刺激作出了什么样的反应。这是通过考虑演讲的背景和演讲的内容来实现的。为了检测立法演讲中的潜在主题，使用基于两层矩阵分解的新的动态主题建模方法来分析语音内容。这种方法适用于1999  -  2014年期间欧洲委员会全体会议上所有英文法律演讲的新语料。我们的研究结果表明，欧洲议会的政治议程随着时间的推移已经发生了很大的变化，受到议会的委员会结构的影响，并对欧盟条约公民投票等外部事件作出反应，欧元危机的出现对欧盟议会正在讨论什么。
