##### Abstract
In this work, a deep learning approach has been developed to carry out road detection using only LIDAR data. Starting from an unstructured point cloud, top-view images encoding several basic statistics such as mean elevation and density are generated. By considering a top-view representation, road detection is reduced to a single-scale problem that can be addressed with a simple and fast fully convolutional neural network (FCN). The FCN is specifically designed for the task of pixel-wise semantic segmentation by combining a large receptive field with high-resolution feature maps. The proposed system achieved excellent performance and it is among the top-performing algorithms on the KITTI road benchmark. Its fast inference makes it particularly suitable for real-time applications.

在这项工作中，已经开发了一种深度学习方法来仅使用LIDAR数据进行道路检测。从非结构化点云开始，生成编码平均高度和密度等几个基本统计量的顶视图图像。通过考虑顶视图表示，道路检测被简化为一个简单而快速的完全卷积神经网络（FCN）可解决的单尺度问题。 FCN是专门为面向像素语义分割的任务而设计的，它将大量的接受区域与高分辨率的特征地图相结合。所提出的系统取得了出色的性能，是KITTI公路基准测试中性能最好的算法之一。它的快速推断使其特别适用于实时应用。
