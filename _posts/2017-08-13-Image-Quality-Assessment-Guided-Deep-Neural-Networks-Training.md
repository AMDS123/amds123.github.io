##### Abstract
For many computer vision problems, the deep neural networks are trained and validated based on the assumption that the input images are pristine (i.e., artifact-free). However, digital images are subject to a wide range of distortions in real application scenarios, while the practical issues regarding image quality in high level visual information understanding have been largely ignored. In this paper, in view of the fact that most widely deployed deep learning models are susceptible to various image distortions, the distorted images are involved for data augmentation in the deep neural network training process to learn a reliable model for practical applications. In particular, an image quality assessment based label smoothing method, which aims at regularizing the label distribution of training images, is further proposed to tune the objective functions in learning the neural network. Experimental results show that the proposed method is effective in dealing with both low and high quality images in the typical image classification task.

对于许多计算机视觉问题，深度神经网络是基于输入图像是原始的（即无伪影）的假设而被训练和验证的。然而，数字图像在实际应用场景中受到广泛的扭曲，而关于高层次视觉信息理解中图像质量的实际问题在很大程度上被忽略。本文针对深度学习模型应用广泛，容易出现各种图像失真的问题，对深度神经网络训练过程中的数据增强涉及到失真图像，为实际应用学习提供可靠的模型。特别提出了一种基于图像质量评估的标签平滑方法，旨在规范训练图像的标签分布，进而调整学习神经网络的目标函数。实验结果表明，所提出的方法在处理典型图像分类任务中的低质量和高质量图像方面是有效的。
