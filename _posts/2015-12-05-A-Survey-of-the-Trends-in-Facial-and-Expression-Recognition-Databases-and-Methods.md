##### Abstract
Automated facial identification and facial expression recognition have been topics of active research over the past few decades. Facial and expression recognition find applications in human-computer interfaces, subject tracking, real-time security surveillance systems and social networking. Several holistic and geometric methods have been developed to identify faces and expressions using public and local facial image databases. In this work we present the evolution in facial image data sets and the methodologies for facial identification and recognition of expressions such as anger, sadness, happiness, disgust, fear and surprise. We observe that most of the earlier methods for facial and expression recognition aimed at improving the recognition rates for facial feature-based methods using static images. However, the recent methodologies have shifted focus towards robust implementation of facial/expression recognition from large image databases that vary with space (gathered from the internet) and time (video recordings). The evolution trends in databases and methodologies for facial and expression recognition can be useful for assessing the next-generation topics that may have applications in security systems or personal identification systems that involve "Quantitative face" assessments.

自动面部识别和面部表情识别一直是过去几十年积极研究的课题。面部表情和表情识别在人机界面，主题跟踪，实时安全监控系统和社交网络中都有应用。已经开发了几种整体和几何方法来使用公共和当地的面部图像数据库来识别面部和表情。在这项工作中，我们介绍面部图像数据集的演变以及面部识别和识别愤怒，悲伤，快乐，厌恶，恐惧和惊奇等表情的方法。我们观察到大多数早期的面部和表情识别方法旨在提高使用静态图像的基于面部特征的方法的识别率。然而，最近的方法已经将焦点转移到大型图像数据库的面部/表情识别的强有力的实施，所述大型图像数据库随空间（从互联网收集）和时间（录像）而变化。面部和表情识别的数据库和方法的发展趋势对于评估可能在安全系统中应用的下一代主题或涉及“定量脸部”评估的个人识别系统非常有用。
