##### Abstract
This paper describes a prototype system that integrates social media analysis into the European Flood Awareness System (EFAS). This integration allows the collection of social media data to be automatically triggered by flood risk warnings determined by a hydro-meteorological model. Then, we adopt a multi-lingual approach to find flood-related messages by employing two state-of-the-art methodologies: language-agnostic word embeddings and language-aligned word embeddings. Both approaches can be used to bootstrap a classifier of social media messages for a new language with little or no labeled data. Finally, we describe a method for selecting relevant and representative messages and displaying them back in the interface of EFAS.
