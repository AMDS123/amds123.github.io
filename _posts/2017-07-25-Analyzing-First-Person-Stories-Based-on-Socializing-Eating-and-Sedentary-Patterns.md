##### Abstract
First-person stories can be analyzed by means of egocentric pictures acquired throughout the whole active day with wearable cameras. This manuscript presents an egocentric dataset with more than 45,000 pictures from four people in different environments such as working or studying. All the images were manually labeled to identify three patterns of interest regarding people's lifestyle: socializing, eating and sedentary. Additionally, two different approaches are proposed to classify egocentric images into one of the 12 target categories defined to characterize these three patterns. The approaches are based on machine learning and deep learning techniques, including traditional classifiers and state-of-art convolutional neural networks. The experimental results obtained when applying these methods to the egocentric dataset demonstrated their adequacy for the problem at hand.

##### Abstract (translated by Google)
第一人称故事可以用可穿戴相机在整个活动当天获得的自我中心图片进行分析。这个手稿提供了一个自我中心的数据集，有来自四个人在不同的环境，如工作或学习，超过45000图片。所有的图像被人工标记，以确定关于人们的生活方式的三种兴趣模式：社交，饮食和久坐。另外，提出了两种不同的方法来将自我中心的图像分类为定义为表征这三种模式的12个目标类别之一。这些方法基于机器学习和深度学习技术，包括传统的分类器和最先进的卷积神经网络。将这些方法应用于自我中心数据集时所获得的实验结果证明了它们对于手头问题的充分性。
