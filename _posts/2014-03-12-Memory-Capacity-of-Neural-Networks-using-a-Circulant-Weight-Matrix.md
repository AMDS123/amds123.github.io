##### Abstract
This paper presents results on the memory capacity of a generalized feedback neural network using a circulant matrix. Children are capable of learning soon after birth which indicates that the neural networks of the brain have prior learnt capacity that is a consequence of the regular structures in the brain's organization. Motivated by this idea, we consider the capacity of circulant matrices as weight matrices in a feedback network.
