##### Abstract
This paper addresses the understanding and characterization of residual networks (ResNet), which are among the state-of-the-art deep learning architectures for a variety of supervised learning problems. We focus on the mapping component of ResNets, which map the embedding space towards a new unknown space where the prediction or classification can be stated according to linear criteria. We show that this mapping component can be regarded as the numerical implementation of continuous flows of diffeomorphisms governed by ordinary differential equations. Especially, ResNets with shared weights are fully characterized as numerical approximation of exponential diffeomorphic operators. We stress both theoretically and numerically the relevance of the enforcement of diffeormorphic properties and the importance of numerical issues to make consistent the continuous formulation and the discretized ResNet implementation. We further discuss the resulting theoretical and computational insights on ResNet architectures.

本文讨论了残余网络（ResNet）的理解和表征，它是各种监督学习问题的最先进的深度学习体系结构之一。我们专注于ResNets的映射组件，它将嵌入空间映射到一个新的未知空间，根据线性标准可以预测或分类。我们证明这个映射分量可以看作是由常微分方程控制的微分连续流的数值实现。特别是，具有共享权重的ResNets被完全表征为指数微分同胚算子的数值近似。我们强调理论上和数值上强调差分形态性质的相关性以及数值问题的重要性，以使连续的表达式和离散化的ResNet实现一致。我们进一步讨论ResNet架构的理论和计算方面的见解。
