##### Abstract
To realize a market entry of autonomous vehicles in the foreseeable future, the behavior planning system will need to abide by the same rules that humans follow. Product liability cannot be enforced without a proper solution to the approval trap. In this paper, we define a semantic abstraction of the continuous space and formalize traffic rules in linear temporal logic (LTL). Sequences in the semantic state space represent maneuvers a high-level planner could choose to execute. We check these maneuvers against the formalized traffic rules using runtime verification. By using the standard model checker NuSMV, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach and provide runtime properties for the maneuver verification. We show that high-level behavior can be verified in a semantic state space to fulfill a set of formalized rules, which could serve as a step towards safety of the intended functionality.
