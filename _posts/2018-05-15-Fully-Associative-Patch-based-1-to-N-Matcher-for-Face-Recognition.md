##### Abstract
This paper focuses on improving face recognition performance by a patch-based 1-to-N signature matcher that learns correlations between different facial patches. A Fully Associative Patch-based Signature Matcher (FAPSM) is proposed so that the local matching identity of each patch contributes to the global matching identities of all the patches. The proposed matcher consists of three steps. First, based on the signature, the local matching identity and the corresponding matching score of each patch are computed. Then, a fully associative weight matrix is learned to obtain the global matching identities and scores of all the patches. At last, the l1-regularized weighting is applied to combine the global matching identity of each patch and obtain a final matching identity. The proposed matcher has been integrated with the UR2D system for evaluation. The experimental results indicate that the proposed matcher achieves better performance than the current UR2D system. The Rank-1 accuracy is improved significantly by 3% and 0.55% on the UHDB31 dataset and the IJB-A dataset, respectively.

本文着重于通过基于补丁的1比N签名匹配器来改进人脸识别性能，该匹配器学习不同面部补丁之间的相关性。提出了完全关联的基于补丁的签名匹配器（FAPSM），以便每个补丁的本地匹配标识有助于所有补丁的全局匹配标识。拟议的匹配器由三个步骤组成。首先，根据签名，计算每个补丁的本地匹配身份和相应的匹配分数。然后，学习完全关联权重矩阵以获得全部匹配身份和所有补丁的分数。最后利用l1正则化权重合并每个补丁的全局匹配身份，得到最终的匹配身份。拟议的匹配器已与UR2D系统集成进行评估。实验结果表明，所提出的匹配器比现有的UR2D系统具有更好的性能。 UHDB31数据集和IJB-A数据集的秩-1准确度分别显着提高3％和0.55％。
