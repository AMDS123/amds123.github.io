##### Abstract
Safety is paramount for mobile robotic platforms such as self-driving cars and unmanned aerial vehicles. This work is devoted to a task that is indispensable for safety yet was largely overlooked in the past -- detecting obstacles that are of very thin structures, such as wires, cables and tree branches. This is a challenging problem, as thin objects can be problematic for active sensors such as lidar and sonar and even for stereo cameras. In this work, we propose to use video sequences for thin obstacle detection. We represent obstacles with edges in the video frames, and reconstruct them in 3D using efficient edge-based visual odometry techniques. We provide both a monocular camera solution and a stereo camera solution. The former incorporates Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) data to solve scale ambiguity, while the latter enjoys a novel, purely vision-based solution. Experiments demonstrated that the proposed methods are fast and able to detect thin obstacles robustly and accurately under various conditions.

移动机器人平台（如自驾车和无人驾驶飞行器）的安全性至关重要。这项工作致力于一项安全不可或缺的工作，但过去一直被忽视 - 检测电线，电缆和树枝等结构非常薄的障碍物。这是一个具有挑战性的问题，因为薄的物体对于有源传感器如激光雷达和声纳甚至是立体相机都是有问题的。在这项工作中，我们建议使用视频序列进行薄弱障碍物检测。我们用视频帧中的边缘表示障碍物，并使用基于边缘的有效视觉测距技术在3D中重建它们。我们提供单眼相机解决方案和立体相机解决方案。前者采用惯性测量单元（IMU）数据来解决尺度模糊，而后者则采用了一种新颖的纯视觉解决方案。实验表明，所提出的方法快速，能够在各种条件下鲁棒，准确地检测薄障碍物。
