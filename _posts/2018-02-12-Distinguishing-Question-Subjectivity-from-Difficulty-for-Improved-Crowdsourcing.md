##### Abstract
The questions in a crowdsourcing task typically exhibit varying degrees of difficulty and subjectivity. Their joint effects give rise to the variation in responses to the same question by different crowd-workers. This variation is low when the question is easy to answer and objective, and high when it is difficult and subjective. Unfortunately, current quality control methods for crowdsourcing consider only the question difficulty to account for the variation. As a result,these methods cannot distinguish workers personal preferences for different correct answers of a partially subjective question from their ability/expertise to avoid objectively wrong answers for that question. To address this issue, we present a probabilistic model which (i) explicitly encodes question difficulty as a model parameter and (ii) implicitly encodes question subjectivity via latent preference factors for crowd-workers. We show that question subjectivity induces grouping of crowd-workers, revealed through clustering of their latent preferences. Moreover, we develop a quantitative measure of the subjectivity of a question. Experiments show that our model(1) improves the performance of both quality control for crowd-sourced answers and next answer prediction for crowd-workers,and (2) can potentially provide coherent rankings of questions in terms of their difficulty and subjectivity, so that task providers can refine their designs of the crowdsourcing tasks, e.g. by removing highly subjective questions or inappropriately difficult questions.

众包任务中的问题通常表现出不同程度的困难和主观性。他们的共同影响导致不同群众工作人员对同一问题的回应存在差异。当问题容易回答和客观时，这种差异很小，而在困难和主观时很高。不幸的是，目前针对众包的质量控制方法只考虑了难以解释变化的问题。因此，这些方法无法区分工作者个人对部分主观问题的正确答案的偏好，以及他们的能力/专业知识，以避免客观上错误地回答该问题。为了解决这个问题，我们提出了一个概率模型：（1）明确地将问题难度作为模型参数进行编码;（2）通过潜在的偏好因子为群众工作者隐式地编码问题主观性。我们表明，问题的主观性诱导了群众工作者的分组，通过对他们的潜在偏好进行聚类显示。此外，我们制定了一个问题的主观性的定量测量。实验表明，我们的模型（1）提高了群众来源答案的质量控制和群众工作者的下一答案预测的表现，并且（2）可以根据他们的难度和主观性提供连贯的问题排序，所以任务提供者可以改进众包任务的设计，例如通过消除高度主观的问题或不恰当的难题。
