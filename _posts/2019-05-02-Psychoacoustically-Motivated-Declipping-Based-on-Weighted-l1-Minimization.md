##### Abstract
A novel method for audio declipping based on sparsity is presented. The method incorporates psychoacoustic information by weighting the transform coefficients in the $\ell_1$ minimization. Weighting leads to an improved quality of restoration while retaining a low complexity of the algorithm. Three possible constructions of the weights are proposed, based on the absolute threshold of hearing, the global masking threshold and on a quadratic curve. Experiments compare the restoration quality according to the signal-to-distortion ratio (SDR) and PEMO-Q objective difference grade (ODG) and indicate that with correctly chosen weights, the presented method is able to compete, or even outperform, the current state of the art.
