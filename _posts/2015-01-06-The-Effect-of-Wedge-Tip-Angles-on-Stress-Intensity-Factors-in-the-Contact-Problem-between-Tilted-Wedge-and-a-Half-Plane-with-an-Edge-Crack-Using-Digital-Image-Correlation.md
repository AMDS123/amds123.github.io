##### Abstract
The first and second mode stress intensity factors (SIFs) of a contact problem between a half-plane with an edge crack and an asymmetric tilted wedge were obtained using experimental method of Digital Image Correlation (DIC). In this technique, displacement and strain fields can be measured using two digital images of the same sample at different stages of loading. However, several images were taken consequently in each stage of this experiment to avoid the noise effect. A pair of images of each stage was compared to each other. Then, the correlation coefficients between them were studied using a computer code. The pairs with the correlation coefficient higher than 0.8 were selected as the acceptable match for displacement measurements near the crack tip. Subsequently, the SIFs of specimens were calculated using displacement fields obtained from DIC method. The effect of wedge tips angle on their SIFs was also studied. Moreover, the results of DIC method were compared with the results of photoelasticity method and a close agreement between them was observed.

利用数字图像相关实验（Digital Image Correlation，DIC）方法，获得了半边缘与边缘裂纹接触问题的第一和第二模态应力强度因子（SIF）。在这种技术中，位移和应变场可以使用相同样品在不同加载阶段的两个数字图像来测量。然而，为了避免噪音的影响，在这个实验的每一个阶段都会拍摄几张照片。每个阶段的一对图像相互比较。然后，使用计算机代码研究它们之间的相关系数。选择相关系数大于0.8的对作为裂纹尖端附近位移测量的可接受匹配。随后，使用从DIC方法获得的位移场来计算样本的SIF。还研究了楔尖角对其SIF的影响。此外，将DIC方法的结果与光弹性方法的结果进行比较，并且观察到它们之间的一致性。
