##### Abstract
ZnO/GaN alloys exhibit exceptional photocatalyst applications owing to the flexibly tunable band gaps that cover a wide range of the solar spectrum, and thus have attracted extensive attentions over the past few years. In this study, first-principles calculations were employed to investigate structural stabilities and electronic properties of (1-100) and (11-20) ZnO/GaN heterostructured nanofilms. The effects of nanofilm thickness and GaN ratio were explored. It was found that all studied heterostructured nanofilms were less stable than the corresponding pure ZnO film but more stable than pure GaN one, exhibiting a much thicker film with better stability. Electronic band structures displayed that both two types of (1-100) and (11-20) heterostructured nanofilms were semiconductors with band gaps strongly depending on the GaN ratios as well as the thicknesses. Of particular interesting is that the band gaps decreased firstly, and then increased with the increasing GaN ratio. Furthermore, electronic contribution to the valence band maximum and the conduction band minimum, and optical absorption were discussed. Our results of ZnO/GaN heterostructured nanofilms with spatial separation of electrons and holes, and flexibly tunable band gaps hold great promise for applications in visible-photovoltaic field.

ZnO / GaN合金由于具有灵活的可调谐带隙，在太阳光谱范围广泛的应用中表现出优异的光催化应用，因此在过去几年引起了广泛的关注。在本研究中，第一性原理计算被用来研究（1-100）和（11-20）ZnO / GaN异质结构纳米薄膜的结构稳定性和电子性质。探讨了纳米膜厚度与GaN比的影响。发现所有研究的异质结构纳米薄膜都不如相应的纯ZnO薄膜稳定，但比纯GaN薄膜更稳定，表现出更厚的薄膜，具有更好的稳定性。电子能带结构表明，（1-100）和（11-20）两种类型的异质结构纳米薄膜都是半导体，其带隙强烈取决于GaN比率和厚度。特别有趣的是，随着GaN比率的增加，带隙先减小后增加。此外，讨论了电子对价带最大值，导带最小值和光吸收的影响。我们的结果表明，ZnO / GaN异质结构纳米薄膜具有电子和空穴的空间分离以及灵活的可调谐带隙，在可见 - 光伏领域具有很好的应用前景。
