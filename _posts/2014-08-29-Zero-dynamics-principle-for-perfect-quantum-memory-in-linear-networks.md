##### Abstract
In this paper, we study a general linear networked system that contains a tunable memory subsystem; that is, it is decoupled from an optical field for state transportation during the storage process, while it couples to the field during the writing or reading process. The input is given by a single photon state or a coherent state in a pulsed light field. We then completely and explicitly characterize the condition required on the pulse shape achieving the perfect state transfer from the light field to the memory subsystem. The key idea to obtain this result is the use of zero-dynamics principle, which in our case means that, for perfect state transfer, the output field during the writing process must be a vacuum. A useful interpretation of the result in terms of the transfer function is also given. Moreover, a four-nodes network composed of atomic ensembles is studied as an example, demonstrating how the input field state is transferred to the memory subsystem and how the input pulse shape to be engineered for perfect memory looks like.

在本文中，我们研究一个包含可调内存子系统的通用线性网络系统;即在存储过程中与状态传输的光场解耦，而在写入或读取过程中耦合到现场。输入由脉冲光场中的单光子状态或相干态给出。然后，我们完全明确地表征脉冲形状所需的条件，实现从光场到存储器子系统的完美状态转移。获得这一结果的关键思想是使用零动力学原理，在我们的情况下意味着，对于完美的状态转移，写入过程中的输出场必须是真空。也给出了对传递函数的结果的有用的解释。此外，以原子集成的四节点网络为例，说明输入场态如何转移到存储器子系统，以及如何设计输入的脉冲形状来完善存储器。
