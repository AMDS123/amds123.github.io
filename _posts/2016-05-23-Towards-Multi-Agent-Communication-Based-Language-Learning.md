##### Abstract
We propose an interactive multimodal framework for language learning. Instead of being passively exposed to large amounts of natural text, our learners (implemented as feed-forward neural networks) engage in cooperative referential games starting from a tabula rasa setup, and thus develop their own language from the need to communicate in order to succeed at the game. Preliminary experiments provide promising results, but also suggest that it is important to ensure that agents trained in this way do not develop an adhoc communication code only effective for the game they are playing

我们提出了一个用于语言学习的交互式多模式框架。我们的学习者（被实现为前馈神经网络）不是被动地接触大量的自然文本，而是从白板设置开始，参与合作参照游戏，从而开发自己的语言，从需要沟通，以成功在游戏中。初步的实验提供了有希望的结果，但是也表明确保以这种方式训练的代理不开发仅对他们正在玩的游戏有效的特别的通信代码是重要的
