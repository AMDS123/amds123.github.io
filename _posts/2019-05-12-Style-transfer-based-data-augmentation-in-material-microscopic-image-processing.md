##### Abstract
Recently progress in material microscopic image semantic segmentation has been driven by high-capacity models trained on large datasets. However, collecting microscopic images with pixel-level labels has been extremely costly due to the amount of human effort required. In this paper, we present an approach to rapidly creating microscopic images with pixel-level labels from material 3d simulated models. Usually images extracted directly from those 3d simulated models are not realistic enough. It is easy to get semantic labels, though. We introduce style transfer technique to make simulated image data more similar to real microscopic data. We validate the presented approach by using real image data from experiment and simulated image data from Monte Carlo Potts Models, which simulate the growth of polycrystal. Experiments show that using the acquired simulated image data and style transfer technique to supplement real images of polycrystalline iron significantly improves the mean precision of image processing. Besides, models trained with simulated image data and just 1/3 of the real data outperform models trained on the complete real image data. In the study of such polycrystalline materials, this approach can reduce pressure of getting and labeling images from microscopes. Also, it can be applied to numbers of other material images.
