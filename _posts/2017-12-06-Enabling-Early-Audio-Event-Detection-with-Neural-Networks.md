##### Abstract
This paper presents a methodology for early detection of audio events from audio streams. Early detection is the ability to infer an ongoing event during its initial stage. The proposed system consists of a novel inference step coupled with dual parallel tailored-loss deep neural networks (DNNs). The DNNs share a similar architecture except for their loss functions, i.e. weighted loss and multitask loss, which are designed to efficiently cope with issues common to audio event detection. The inference step is newly introduced to make use of the network outputs for recognizing ongoing events. The monotonicity of the detection function is required for reliable early detection, and will also be proved. Experiments on the ITC-Irst database show that the proposed system achieves state-of-the-art detection performance. Furthermore, even partial events are sufficient to achieve good performance similar to that obtained when an entire event is observed, enabling early event detection.

本文介绍了一种早期检测音频流音频事件的方法。早期检测是在初始阶段推断正在进行的事件的能力。提出的系统由一个新的推理步骤加上双并行定制损失深度神经网络（DNNs）。除了DNN的损失函数，即加权损失和多任务丢失，这些DNN共享相似的体系结构，旨在有效地解决音频事件检测常见的问题。新推出的推理步骤是利用网络输出来识别正在进行的事件。检测功能的单调性是可靠的早期检测所必需的，也将被证明。在ITC-Irst数据库上的实验表明，所提出的系统实现了最先进的检测性能。此外，即使是部分事件也足以实现与观察整个事件时所获得的类似的良好性能，从而能够进行早期事件检测。
