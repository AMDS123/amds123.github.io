##### Abstract
The power law is ubiquitous in natural and social phenomena, and is considered as a universal relationship between the frequency and its rank for diverse social systems. However, a general model is still lacking to interpret why these seemingly unrelated systems share great similarity. Through a detailed analysis of natural language texts and simulation experiments based on the proposed 'Hierarchical Selection Model', we found that the existence of hierarchies and human's pursuit of top hierarchy lead to the power law. Further, the power law is a statistical and emergent performance of hierarchies, and it is the universality of hierarchies that contributes to the ubiquity of the power law.

##### Abstract (translated by Google)
幂律在自然界和社会现象中无处不在，被认为是不同社会系统的频率和等级之间的普遍关系。然而，通用模型仍然缺乏解释为什么这些看起来不相关的系统具有很大的相似性。通过对自然语言文本的详细分析和基于提出的“层次选择模型”的模拟实验，发现层次结构的存在和人类对最高层次的追求导致了幂律。而且，幂律是层次结构的统计性和突发性表现，是有助于幂律无所不在的层次结构的普遍性。
