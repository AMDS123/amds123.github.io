##### Abstract
Localizing radio frequency (RF) sources with an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) has many important applications. As a result, UAV-based localization has been the focus of much research. However, previous approaches rely heavily on custom electronics and specialized knowledge, are not robust and require extensive calibration, or are inefficient with measurements and waste energy on a battery-constrained platform. In this work, we present a system based on a multirotor UAV that addresses these shortcomings. Our system measures signal strength received by two antennas to update a probability distribution over possible transmitter locations. An information-theoretic controller is used to direct the UAV's search. Signal strength is measured with low-cost, commercial-off-the-shelf components. We demonstrate our system using three transmitters: a continuous signal in the UHF band, a wildlife collar pulsing in the VHF band, and a cell phone making a voice call over LTE. Our system significantly outperforms previous methods, localizing the RF source in the same time it takes previous methods to make a single measurement.

利用无人驾驶飞行器（UAV）定位射频（RF）源具有许多重要的应用。因此，基于无人机的本地化已成为许多研究的焦点。然而，先前的方法严重依赖于定制电子设备和专业知识，不稳健且需要大量校准，或者在电池约束平台上的测量和浪费能量效率低。在这项工作中，我们提出了一个基于多旋翼无人机的系统，以解决这些缺点。我们的系统测量由两个天线接收的信号强度，以更新可能的发射机位置上的概率分布。信息理论控制器用于指导无人机的搜索。信号强度使用低成本的商用现成组件进行测量。我们使用三个发射器演示了我们的系统：UHF频段的连续信号，VHF频段的野生动物项圈以及通过LTE进行语音呼叫的手机。我们的系统明显优于以前的方法，在以前的方法进行单次测量的同时定位RF源。
