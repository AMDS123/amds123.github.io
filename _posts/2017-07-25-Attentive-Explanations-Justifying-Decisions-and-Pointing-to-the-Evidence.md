##### Abstract
Deep models are the defacto standard in visual decision models due to their impressive performance on a wide array of visual tasks. However, they are frequently seen as opaque and are unable to explain their decisions. In contrast, humans can justify their decisions with natural language and point to the evidence in the visual world which led to their decisions. We postulate that deep models can do this as well and propose our Pointing and Justification (PJ-X) model which can justify its decision with a sentence and point to the evidence by introspecting its decision and explanation process using an attention mechanism. Unfortunately there is no dataset available with reference explanations for visual decision making. We thus collect two datasets in two domains where it is interesting and challenging to explain decisions. First, we extend the visual question answering task to not only provide an answer but also a natural language explanation for the answer. Second, we focus on explaining human activities which is traditionally more challenging than object classification. We extensively evaluate our PJ-X model, both on the justification and pointing tasks, by comparing it to prior models and ablations using both automatic and human evaluations.

深度模型是视觉决策模型中的事实标准，因为它们在广泛的视觉任务上表现出色。但是，他们经常被认为是不透明的，无法解释他们的决定。相比之下，人类可以用自然语言为自己的决定辩护，并指出导致他们作出决定的视觉世界中的证据。我们假设深层模型也可以做到这一点，并提出我们的指点和理由（PJ-X）模型，它可以用一个句子来证明它的决定的正确性，并通过使用注意机制反思它的决定和解释过程来指出证据。不幸的是，没有可供参考的解释用于视觉决策的数据集。因此，我们在两个领域收集两个数据集，这对解释决策很有意义且具有挑战性。首先，我们将视觉问题的解答扩展到不仅为答案提供答案，而且为答案提供自然语言解释。其次，我们着重解释传统上比对象分类更具挑战性的人类活动。我们广泛地评估我们的PJ-X模型，无论是在理由和指点任务，通过比较它以前的模型和消融同时使用自动和人工评估。
