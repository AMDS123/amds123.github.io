##### Abstract
Readability is defined as the reading level of the speech from grade 1 to grade 12. It results from the use of the REAP readability analysis (vocabulary - Collins-Thompson and Callan, 2004; syntax - Heilman et al ,2006, 2007), which use the lexical contents and grammatical structure of the sentences in a document to predict the reading level. After analysis, results were grouped into the average readability of each candidate, the evolution of the candidate's speeches' readability over time and the standard deviation, or how much each candidate varied their speech from one venue to another. For comparison, one speech from four past presidents and the Gettysburg Address were also analyzed.

可读性被定义为从1年级到12年级的语音阅读水平。它来自于使用REAP可读性分析（词汇 -  Collins-Thompson和Callan，2004;语法 -  Heilman等人，2006,2007），使用文档中句子的词汇内容和语法结构来预测阅读水平。经过分析，结果分为每个候选人的平均可读性，候选人演讲的可读性随时间的演变和标准差，或每个候选人从一个场所到另一个场所的变化。为了比较，还分析了四位总统的讲话和葛底斯堡演讲。
