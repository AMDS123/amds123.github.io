##### Abstract
In this study, a novel illuminant color estimation framework is proposed for color constancy, which incorporates the high representational capacity of deep-learning-based models and the great interpretability of assumption-based models. The well-designed building block, feature map reweight unit (ReWU), helps to achieve comparative accuracy on benchmark datasets with respect to prior state-of-the-art models while requiring only 1%-5% model size and 8%-20% computational cost. In addition to local color estimation, a confidence estimation branch is also included such that the model is able to produce point estimate and its uncertainty estimate simultaneously, which provides useful clues for local estimates aggregation and multiple illumination estimation. The source code and the dataset are available at https://github.com/QiuJueqin/Reweight-CC.
