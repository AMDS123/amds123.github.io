##### Abstract
To guarantee the safe and efficient motion planning of autonomous driving under dynamic traffic environment, the autonomous vehicle should be equipped with not only the optimal but also a long term efficient policy to deal with complex scenarios. The first challenge is that to acquire the optimal planning trajectory means to sacrifice the planning efficiency. The second challenge is that most search based planning method cannot find the desired trajectory in extreme scenario. In this paper, we propose a data driven approach for motion planning to solve the above challenges. We transform the lane change mission into Mixed Integer Quadratic Problem with logical constraints, allowing the planning module to provide feasible, safe and comfortable actions in more complex scenario. Furthermore, we propose a hierarchical learning structure to guarantee online, fast and more generalized motion planning. Our approach's performance is demonstrated in the simulated lane change scenario and compared with related planning method.
