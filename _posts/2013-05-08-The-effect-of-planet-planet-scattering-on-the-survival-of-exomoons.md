##### Abstract
Compared to the giant planets in the solar system, exoplanets have many remarkable properties such as the prevalence of giant planets on eccentric orbits and the presence of hot Jupiters. Planet-planet scattering (PPS) between giant planets is a possible mechanism in interpreting above and other observed properties. If the observed giant planet architectures are indeed the outcomes of PPS, such drastic dynamical process must affect their primordial moon systems. In this Letter, we discuss the effect of the PPS on the survival of their regular moons. From the viewpoint of observations, some preliminary conclusions are drawn from the simulations. 1. PPS is a destructive process to the moon systems, single planets on eccentric orbits are not the ideal moon-search targets. 2. If hot Jupiters formed through PPS, their original moons have little chance to survive. 3. Planets in multiple systems with small eccentricities are more likely holding their primordial moons. 4. Compared to the lower-mass planets, the massive ones in multiple systems may not be the preferred moon-search targets if the system underwent a PPS history.
