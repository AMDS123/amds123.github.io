##### Abstract
Divergent word usages reflect differences among people. In this paper, we present a novel angle for studying word usage divergence -- word interpretations. We propose an approach that quantifies semantic differences in interpretations among different groups of people. The effectiveness of our approach is validated by quantitative evaluations. Experiment results indicate that divergences in word interpretations exist. We further apply the approach to two well studied types of differences between people -- gender and region. The detected words with divergent interpretations reveal the unique features of specific groups of people. For gender, we discover that certain different interests, social attitudes, and characters between males and females are reflected in their divergent interpretations of many words. For region, we find that specific interpretations of certain words reveal the geographical and cultural features of different regions.

分歧的用法反映了人们之间的差异。在本文中，我们提出了一个新的角度来研究词用法分歧 - 词的解释。我们提出了一种方法来量化不同群体之间解释的语义差异。我们的方法的有效性通过定量评估来验证。实验结果表明，词语解释存在分歧。我们进一步将这种方法应用于人们之间差异的两种研究 - 性别和地区。被发现的词有不同的解释，揭示了特定人群的独特性。对于性别而言，我们发现男女之间的某些不同的兴趣，社会态度和性格反映在他们对许多单词的不同解读中。对于地区来说，我们发现对某些词的具体解释揭示了不同地区的地理和文化特征。
