##### Abstract
The effect of edge-type dislocation wall strain field on the Hall mobility in n-type epitaxial GaN was theoretically investigated through deformation potential within the relaxation time approach. It was found that this channel of scattering can play a considerable role in the low-temperature transport at the certain set of the model parameters. The low temperature experimental data were fitted by including this mechanism of scattering along with ionized impurities and charge dislocation ones.
