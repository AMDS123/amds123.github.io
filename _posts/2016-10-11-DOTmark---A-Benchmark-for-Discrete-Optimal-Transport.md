##### Abstract
The Wasserstein metric or earth mover's distance (EMD) is a useful tool in statistics, machine learning and computer science with many applications to biological or medical imaging, among others. Especially in the light of increasingly complex data, the computation of these distances via optimal transport is often the limiting factor. Inspired by this challenge, a variety of new approaches to optimal transport has been proposed in recent years and along with these new methods comes the need for a meaningful comparison. In this paper, we introduce a benchmark for discrete optimal transport, called DOTmark, which is designed to serve as a neutral collection of problems, where discrete optimal transport methods can be tested, compared to one another, and brought to their limits on large-scale instances. It consists of a variety of grayscale images, in various resolutions and classes, such as several types of randomly generated images, classical test images and real data from microscopy. Along with the DOTmark we present a survey and a performance test for a cross section of established methods ranging from more traditional algorithms, such as the transportation simplex, to recently developed approaches, such as the shielding neighborhood method, and including also a comparison with commercial solvers.

Wasserstein公制或地球移动者的距离（EMD）是统计学，机器学习和计算机科学中有用的工具，其中有许多应用于生物或医学成像。特别是在数据日益复杂的情况下，通过最佳运输计算这些距离往往是限制因素。受到这一挑战的启发，近年来提出了各种各样的最佳运输新方法，并且随着这些新方法的出现，需要进行有意义的比较。在本文中，我们引入了一个名为DOTmark的离散最优运输的基准，它被设计成一个中立的问题集合，其中离散的最优运输方法可以相互比较地进行测试，大规模实例。它由各种分辨率和类别的各种灰度图像组成，例如随机生成的几种图像，经典的测试图像和显微镜的实际数据。与DOTmark一起，我们提出了一个调查和性能测试的方法，从传统的算法，如交通单纯，到最近开发的方法，如屏蔽邻域方法，并包括与商业求解。
