##### Abstract
3D object recognition has attracted wide research attention in the field of multimedia and computer vision. With the recent proliferation of deep learning, various deep models with different representations have achieved the state-of-the-art performance. Among them, point cloud and multi-view based 3D shape representations are promising recently, and their corresponding deep models have shown significant performance on 3D shape recognition. However, there is little effort concentrating point cloud data and multi-view data for 3D shape representation, which is, in our consideration, beneficial and compensated to each other. In this paper, we propose the Point-View Network (PVNet), the first framework integrating both the point cloud and the multi-view data towards joint 3D shape recognition. More specifically, an embedding attention fusion scheme is proposed that could employ high-level features from the multi-view data to model the intrinsic correlation and discriminability of different structure features from the point cloud data. In particular, the discriminative descriptions are quantified and leveraged as the soft attention mask to further refine the structure feature of the 3D shape. We have evaluated the proposed method on the ModelNet40 dataset for 3D shape classification and retrieval tasks. Experimental results and comparisons with state-of-the-art methods demonstrate that our framework can achieve superior performance.

三维物体识别在多媒体和计算机视觉领域引起了广泛的研究关注。随着最近深度学习的激增，具有不同表现形式的各种深度模型已经达到了最先进的性能。其中，基于点云和多视图的三维形状表示最近很有希望，其相应的深度模型在三维形状识别方面表现出显着的性能。然而，很少有人将点云数据和多视图数据集中用于3D形状表示，这在我们的考虑中是有益的并且相互补偿。在本文中，我们提出了点视网络（PVNet），这是第一个将点云和多视图数据集成到联合3D形状识别的框架。更具体地，提出了一种嵌入式注意力融合方案，其可以采用来自多视图数据的高级特征来对来自点云数据的不同结构特征的内在相关性和可辨性进行建模。特别地，辨别描述被量化并且被用作软注意掩模以进一步细化3D形状的结构特征。我们已经对ModelNet40数据集上的3D形状分类和检索任务进行了评估。实验结果和与最先进方法的比较表明我们的框架可以实现卓越的性能。
