##### Abstract
Robots need task planning algorithms to sequence actions toward accomplishing goals that are impossible through individual actions. Off-the-shelf task planners can be used by intelligent robotics practitioners to solve a variety of planning problems. However, many different planners exist, each with different strengths and weaknesses, and there are no general rules for which planner would be best to apply to a given problem. 
 In this article, we empirically compare the performance of state-of-the-art planners that use either the Planning Domain Description Language (PDDL), or Answer Set Programming (ASP) as the underlying action language. PDDL is designed for task planning, and PDDL-based planners are widely used for a variety of planning problems. ASP is designed for knowledge-intensive reasoning, but can also be used for solving task planning problems. Given domain encodings that are as similar as possible, we find that PDDL-based planners perform better on problems with longer solutions, and ASP-based planners are better on tasks with a large number of objects or in which complex reasoning is required to reason about action preconditions and effects. The resulting analysis can inform selection among general purpose planning systems for particular robot task planning domains.
