##### Abstract
Industry is evolving towards Industry 4.0, which holds the promise of increased flexibility in manufacturing, better quality and improved productivity. A core actor of this growth is using sensors, which must capture data that can used in unforeseen ways to achieve a performance not achievable without them. However, the complexity of this improved setting is much greater than what is currently used in practice. Hence, it is imperative that the management cannot only be performed by human labor force, but part of that will be done by automated algorithms instead. A natural way to represent the data generated by this large amount of sensors, which are not acting measuring independent variables, and the interaction of the different devices is by using a graph data model. Then, machine learning could be used to aid the Industry 4.0 system to, for example, perform predictive maintenance. However, machine learning directly on graphs, needs feature engineering and has scalability issues. In this paper we discuss methods to convert (embed) the graph in a vector space, such that it becomes feasible to use traditional machine learning methods for Industry 4.0 settings.

工业正在向工业4.0发展，工业4.0有望提高制造灵活性，提高质量和提高生产率。这种增长的核心角色是使用传感器，传感器必须捕获可以无法预料的方式使用的数据，以实现没有它们无法实现的性能。但是，这种改进设置的复杂性远远大于目前在实践中使用的设置。因此，管理层不仅必须由人力劳动力执行，而且其中一部分将由自动算法完成。表示由大量传感器生成的数据的自然方式是不依赖于测量独立变量，以及不同设备的交互是通过使用图形数据模型。然后，机器学习可用于帮助工业4.0系统，例如，执行预测性维护。但是，机器直接在图形上学习，需要特征工程并且具有可伸缩性问题。在本文中，我们讨论了在向量空间中转换（嵌入）图形的方法，以便在工业4.0设置中使用传统的机器学习方法变得可行。
