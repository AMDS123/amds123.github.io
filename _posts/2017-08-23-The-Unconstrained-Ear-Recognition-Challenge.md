##### Abstract
In this paper we present the results of the Unconstrained Ear Recognition Challenge (UERC), a group benchmarking effort centered around the problem of person recognition from ear images captured in uncontrolled conditions. The goal of the challenge was to assess the performance of existing ear recognition techniques on a challenging large-scale dataset and identify open problems that need to be addressed in the future. Five groups from three continents participated in the challenge and contributed six ear recognition techniques for the evaluation, while multiple baselines were made available for the challenge by the UERC organizers. A comprehensive analysis was conducted with all participating approaches addressing essential research questions pertaining to the sensitivity of the technology to head rotation, flipping, gallery size, large-scale recognition and others. The top performer of the UERC was found to ensure robust performance on a smaller part of the dataset (with 180 subjects) regardless of image characteristics, but still exhibited a significant performance drop when the entire dataset comprising 3,704 subjects was used for testing.

在本文中，我们提出了无约束耳朵识别挑战（UERC）的结果，这是一个集体基准测试，集中在从不受控制条件下拍摄的耳朵图像中识别人的问题。挑战的目标是评估现有耳识别技术在具有挑战性的大规模数据集上的性能，并确定未来需要解决的未决问题。来自三大洲的五个小组参加了挑战，并为评估贡献了六个耳朵识别技术，同时UERC组织者提供了多个基线供挑战。所有参与的方法都进行了综合分析，以解决有关技术对头部旋转，翻转，画廊大小，大规模认可等敏感度的重要研究问题。发现UERC表现最好的是确保在数据集的一小部分（具有180名受试者）上的稳健表现，而不管图像特征如何，但是当包括3,704名受试者的整个数据集被用于测试时仍然表现出显着的性能下降。
