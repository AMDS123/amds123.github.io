##### Abstract
In this work, we formulate the process of generating explanations as model reconciliation for planning problems as one of planning with explanatory actions. We show that these problems could be better understood within the framework of epistemic planning and that, in fact, most earlier works on explanation as model reconciliation correspond to tractable subsets of epistemic planning problems. We empirically show how our approach is computationally more efficient than existing techniques for explanation generation and also discuss how this particular approach could be extended to capture most of the existing variants of explanation as model reconciliation. We end the paper with a discussion of how this formulation could be extended to generate novel explanatory behaviors.
