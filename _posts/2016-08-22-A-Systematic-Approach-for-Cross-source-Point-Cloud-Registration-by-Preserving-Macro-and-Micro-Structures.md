##### Abstract
We propose a systematic approach for registering cross-source point clouds. The compelling need for cross-source point cloud registration is motivated by the rapid development of a variety of 3D sensing techniques, but many existing registration methods face critical challenges as a result of the large variations in cross-source point clouds. This paper therefore illustrates a novel registration method which successfully aligns two cross-source point clouds in the presence of significant missing data, large variations in point density, scale difference and so on. The robustness of the method is attributed to the extraction of macro and micro structures. Our work has three main contributions: (1) a systematic pipeline to deal with cross-source point cloud registration; (2) a graph construction method to maintain macro and micro structures; (3) a new graph matching method is proposed which considers the global geometric constraint to robustly register these variable graphs. Compared to most of the related methods, the experiments show that the proposed method successfully registers in cross-source datasets, while other methods have difficulty achieving satisfactory results. The proposed method also shows great ability in same-source datasets.

我们提出了一个注册跨源点云的系统方法。交叉源点云注册的迫切需求是由各种3D感测技术的快速发展激发的，但是由于交叉源点云的巨大变化，许多现有的注册方法面临着严峻的挑战。因此，本文阐述了一种新的配准方法，该方法能够在存在重大缺失数据，点密度变化大，尺度差等问题的情况下成功地对齐两个交叉源点云。该方法的鲁棒性归因于宏观和微观结构的提取。我们的工作有三个主要贡献：（1）处理跨源点云注册的系统流水线; （2）保持宏观和微观结构的图形构建方法; （3）提出了一种新的图匹配方法，该方法考虑了全局几何约束条件来鲁棒地记录这些变量图。与大多数相关方法相比，实验表明，所提出的方法在跨源数据集中成功注册，而其他方法难以取得满意的结果。所提出的方法在同源数据集中也表现出很强的能力。
