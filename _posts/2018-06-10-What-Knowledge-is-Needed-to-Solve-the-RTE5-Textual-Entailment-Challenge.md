##### Abstract
This document gives a knowledge-oriented analysis of about 20 interesting Recognizing Textual Entailment (RTE) examples, drawn from the 2005 RTE5 competition test set. The analysis ignores shallow statistical matching techniques between T and H, and rather asks: What would it take to reasonably infer that T implies H? What world knowledge would be needed for this task? Although such knowledge-intensive techniques have not had much success in RTE evaluations, ultimately an intelligent system should be expected to know and deploy this kind of world knowledge required to perform this kind of reasoning. 
 The selected examples are typically ones which our RTE system (called BLUE) got wrong and ones which require world knowledge to answer. In particular, the analysis covers cases where there was near-perfect lexical overlap between T and H, yet the entailment was NO, i.e., examples that most likely all current RTE systems will have got wrong. A nice example is #341 (page 26), that requires inferring from "a river floods" that "a river overflows its banks". Seems it should be easy, right? Enjoy!

##### Abstract (translated by Google)
本文件对2005年RTE5竞赛测试集中大约20个有趣的“识别语篇”（RTE）示例进行了面向知识的分析。分析忽略了T和H之间的浅层统计匹配技术，而是问：如何合理推断T意味着H？这项任务需要哪些世界知识？虽然这些知识密集型技术在RTE评估中没有取得太大成功，但最终应该期望智能系统知道并部署执行这种推理所需的这种世界知识。
 所选择的例子通常是我们的RTE系统（称为BLUE）出错的那些以及需要世界知识来回答的例子。特别是，分析涵盖了T与H之间存在近乎完美的词汇重叠的情况，但所需要的是NO，即最有可能所有当前RTE系统都会出错的例子。一个很好的例子是＃341（第26页），这需要从“河流洪水”推断“河流溢出河流”。看起来应该很简单吧？请享用！
