##### Abstract
Solar energy is one of the most important sources of renewable energy and the cleanest form of energy. In India, where solar energy could produce power around trillion kilowatt hours in a year, we are producing only power of around 20 Gigawatts. Many people are not aware of the solar potential of their rooftop and hence they always think that installing solar panels is very much expensive. Therefore, we proposed an approach through which we can provide the amount of solar potential of a building using only its latitude and longitude. We evaluated various types of rooftops to make our solution more robust. We also provide an approximate area of rooftop that can be used for solar panels placement and a visual analysis of how solar panels can be placed to maximize the output of solar power at a location.
