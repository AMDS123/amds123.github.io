##### Abstract
Skeleton-based human action recognition has recently attracted increasing attention due to the popularity of 3D skeleton data. One main challenge lies in the large view variations in captured human actions. We propose a novel view adaptation scheme to automatically regulate observation viewpoints during the occurrence of an action. Rather than re-positioning the skeletons based on a human defined prior criterion, we design a view adaptive recurrent neural network (RNN) with LSTM architecture, which enables the network itself to adapt to the most suitable observation viewpoints from end to end. Extensive experiment analyses show that the proposed view adaptive RNN model strives to (1) transform the skeletons of various views to much more consistent viewpoints and (2) maintain the continuity of the action rather than transforming every frame to the same position with the same body orientation. Our model achieves significant improvement over the state-of-the-art approaches on three benchmark datasets.

由于3D骨架数据的普及，最近基于骨架的人体动作识别已经引起越来越多的关注。一个主要的挑战在于捕捉到的人类行为的大视野变化。我们提出了一种新颖的视图自适应方案，以便在动作发生期间自动调节观察视点。我们设计了一种具有LSTM结构的视图自适应递归神经网络（RNN），而不是根据人为定义的先验准则重新定位骨架，从而使网络本身能够适应最适合的观察视点。大量的实验分析表明，所提出的视图自适应RNN模型致力于（1）将各种视图的骨架转换为更加一致的视点，（2）保持动作的连续性，而不是将每个帧转换到与同一个体相同的位置方向。我们的模型比三个基准数据集上最先进的方法有了显着的改进。
