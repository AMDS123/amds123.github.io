##### Abstract
In this paper, we present a solution for arbitrary 3D character deformation by investigating rotation angle of decomposition and preserving the mesh topology structure. In computer graphics, skeleton extraction and skeleton-driven animation is an active areas and gains increasing interests from researchers. The accuracy is critical for realistic animation and related applications. There have been extensive studies on skeleton based 3D deformation. However for the scenarios of large angle rotation of different body parts, it has been relatively less addressed by the state-of-the-art, which often yield unsatisfactory results. Besides 3D animation problems, we also notice for many 3D skeleton detection or tracking applications from a video or depth streams, large angle rotation is also a critical factor in the regression accuracy and robustness. We introduced a distortion metric function to quantify the surface curviness before and after deformation, which is a major clue for large angle rotation detection. The intensive experimental results show that our method is suitable for 3D modeling, animation, skeleton based tracking applications.

在本文中，我们通过研究分解的旋转角度并保留网格拓扑结构，给出了任意3D字符变形的解决方案。在计算机图形学中，骨架提取和骨架驱动动画是一个活跃的领域，并且越来越受到研究者的兴趣。准确性对于逼真的动画和相关应用程序至关重要。对基于骨架的三维变形进行了广泛的研究。然而，对于不同身体部位的大角度旋转的情况，现有技术的相对较少，往往产生不令人满意的结果。除了3D动画问题之外，我们还注意到许多3D视频或深度流的骨架检测或跟踪应用程序，大角度旋转也是回归精度和鲁棒性的关键因素。我们引入了失真度量函数来量化变形前后的曲面曲率，这是大角度旋转检测的主要线索。实验结果表明，该方法适用于三维建模，动画，基于骨架的跟踪应用。
