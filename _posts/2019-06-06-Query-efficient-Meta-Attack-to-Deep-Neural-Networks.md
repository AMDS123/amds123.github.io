##### Abstract
Recently, several adversarial attack methods to black-box deep neural networks have been proposed and they serve as an excellent testing bed for investigating safety issues with DNNs. These methods generally take in the query and corresponding feedback from the targeted DNN model and infer suitable attack patterns accordingly. However, due to lacking prior and inefficiency in leveraging the query information, these methods are mostly query-intensive. In this work, we propose a meta attack strategy which is capable of attacking the target black-box model with much fewer queries. Its high query-efficiency comes from prior abstraction on training a meta attacker which can speed up the search for adversarial examples significantly. Extensive experiments on MNIST, CIFAR10 and tiny-Imagenet demonstrate that, our meta-attack method can remarkably reduce the number of model queries without sacrificing the attack performance. Moreover, the obtained meta attacker is not restricted to a particular model but can be reused easily with fast adaptive ability to attack a variety of models.
