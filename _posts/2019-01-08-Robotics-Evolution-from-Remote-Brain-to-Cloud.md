##### Abstract
Robotic systems have been evolving since decades and touching almost all aspects of life, either for leisure or critical applications. Most of traditional robotic systems operate in well-defined environments utilizing pre-configured on-board processing units. However, modern and foreseen robotic applications ask for complex processing requirements that exceed the limits of on-board computing power. Cloud computing and the related technologies have high potential to overcome on-board hardware restrictions and can improve the performance efficiency. This research highlights the advancements in robotic systems with focus on cloud robotics as an emerging trend. There exists an extensive amount of effort to leverage the potentials of robotic systems and to handle arising shortcomings. Moreover, there are promising insights for future breed of intelligent, flexible, and autonomous robotic systems in the Internet of Things era.
