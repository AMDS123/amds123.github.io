##### Abstract
Cooperative vehicle platooning applications increasingly demand realistic simulation tools to ease their validation and to bridge the gap between development and real-world deployment. However, their complexity and cost often hinder its validation in the real world. In this paper, we propose a realistic simulation framework for vehicular platoons that integrates Gazebo with OMNeT++ over Robot Operating System (ROS) to support the simulation of realistic scenarios of autonomous vehicular platoons and their cooperative control.
