##### Abstract
Segmentation is the process of identifying object outlines within images. There are a number of efficient algorithms for segmentation in Euclidean space that depend on the variational approach and partial differential equation modelling. Wavelets have been used successfully in various problems in image processing, including segmentation, inpainting, noise removal, super-resolution image restoration, and many others. Wavelets on the sphere have been developed to solve such problems for data defined on the sphere, which arise in numerous fields such as cosmology and geophysics. In this work, we propose a wavelet-based method to segment images on the sphere, accounting for the underlying geometry of spherical data. Our method is a direct extension of the tight-frame based segmentation method used to automatically identify tube-like structures such as blood vessels in medical imaging. It is compatible with any arbitrary type of wavelet frame defined on the sphere, such as axisymmetric wavelets, directional wavelets, curvelets, and hybrid wavelet constructions. Such an approach allows the desirable properties of wavelets to be naturally inherited in the segmentation process. In particular, directional wavelets and curvelets, which were designed to efficiently capture directional signal content, provide additional advantages in segmenting images containing prominent directional and curvilinear features. We present several numerical experiments, applying our wavelet-based segmentation method, as well as the common K-means method, on real-world spherical images. These experiments demonstrate the superiority of our method and show that it is capable of segmenting different kinds of spherical images, including those with prominent directional features. Moreover, our algorithm is efficient with convergence usually within a few iterations.

分割是识别图像内的对象轮廓的过程。欧几里德空间中有许多有效的分割算法，依赖于变分法和偏微分方程模型。小波在图像处理中的各种问题已被成功应用，包括分割，修复，噪声消除，超分辨率图像恢复等等。小球上的小波已经被开发出来，用来解决在球体上定义的数据问题，这些问题在宇宙学和地球物理学等众多领域中都有出现。在这项工作中，我们提出了一种基于小波的方法来分割球体上的图像，说明球形数据的基本几何形状。我们的方法是基于紧密框架的分割方法的直接扩展，用于在医学成像中自动识别诸如血管的管状结构。它与在球体上定义的任意类型的小波框架兼容，如轴对称小波，方向小波，曲波和混合小波结构。这种方法允许在分割过程中自然地继承小波的理想特性。具体而言，被设计为有效地捕获定向信号内容的定向小波和曲线小波在分割包含突出的定向和曲线特征的图像方面提供附加的优点。我们提出了几个数值实验，应用我们的基于小波的分割方法，以及普通的K-means方法，在现实世界的球形图像。这些实验证明了我们的方法的优越性，并且表明它能够分割不同类型的球形图像，包括具有突出方向特征的球形图像。而且，我们的算法通常在几次迭代之内对于收敛是有效的。
