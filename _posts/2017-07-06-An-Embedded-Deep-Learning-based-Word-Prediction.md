##### Abstract
Recent developments in deep learning with application to language modeling have led to success in tasks of text processing, summarizing and machine translation. However, deploying huge language models for mobile device such as on-device keyboards poses computation as a bottle-neck due to their puny computation capacities. In this work we propose an embedded deep learning based word prediction method that optimizes run-time memory and also provides a real time prediction environment. Our model size is 7.40MB and has average prediction time of 6.47 ms. We improve over the existing methods for word prediction in terms of key stroke savings and word prediction rate.

最近在深度学习中应用语言建模的发展导致了文本处理，概述和机器翻译任务的成功。然而，为移动设备部署大型语言模型，例如设备上的键盘，由于计算能力不足，将计算作为瓶颈。在这项工作中，我们提出了一种嵌入式深度学习的单词预测方法，优化运行时记忆，并提供了一个实时的预测环境。我们的模型大小为7.40MB，平均预测时间为6.47毫秒。在关键笔划节省和字预测率方面，我们改进了现有的字预测方法。
