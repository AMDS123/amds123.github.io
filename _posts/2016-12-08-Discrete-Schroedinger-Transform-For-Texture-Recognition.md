##### Abstract
This work presents a new procedure to extract features of grey-level texture images based on the discrete Schroedinger transform. This is a non-linear transform where the image is mapped as the initial probability distribution of a wave function and such distribution evolves in time following the Schroedinger equation from Quantum Mechanics. The features are provided by statistical moments of the distribution measured at different times. The proposed method is applied to the classification of three databases of textures used for benchmark and compared to other well-known texture descriptors in the literature, such as textons, local binary patterns, multifractals, among others. All of them are outperformed by the proposed method in terms of percentage of images correctly classified. The proposal is also applied to the identification of plant species using scanned images of leaves and again it outperforms other texture methods. A test with images affected by Gaussian and "salt \& pepper" noise is also carried out, also with the best performance achieved by the Schroedinger descriptors.

##### Abstract (translated by Google)
本文提出了一种基于离散Schroedinger变换提取灰度纹理图像特征的新方法。这是一个非线性变换，其中图像被映射为波函数的初始概率分布，并且这种分布随着来自量子力学的Schroedinger方程而随时间演化。这些特征由在不同时间测量的分布统计矩提供。所提出的方法被应用于用于基准的三个纹理数据库的分类，并且与文献中其它着名的纹理描述符比较，例如文本，局部二进制模式，多重分形等等。所有这些在正确分类的图像的百分比方面均优于所提出的方法。该提案也适用于利用叶子的扫描图像识别植物物种，并且再次优于其他纹理方法。也进行了受高斯和“盐胡椒”噪声影响的图像测试，同时还使用了Schroedinger描述符获得的最佳性能。
