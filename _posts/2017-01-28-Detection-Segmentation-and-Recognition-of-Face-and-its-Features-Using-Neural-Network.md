##### Abstract
Face detection and recognition has been prevalent with research scholars and diverse approaches have been incorporated till date to serve purpose. The rampant advent of biometric analysis systems, which may be full body scanners, or iris detection and recognition systems and the finger print recognition systems, and surveillance systems deployed for safety and security purposes have contributed to inclination towards same. Advances has been made with frontal view, lateral view of the face or using facial expressions such as anger, happiness and gloominess, still images and video image to be used for detection and recognition. This led to newer methods for face detection and recognition to be introduced in achieving accurate results and economically feasible and extremely secure. Techniques such as Principal Component analysis (PCA), Independent component analysis (ICA), Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), have been the predominant ones to be used. But with improvements needed in the previous approaches Neural Networks based recognition was like boon to the industry. It not only enhanced the recognition but also the efficiency of the process. Choosing Backpropagation as the learning method was clearly out of its efficiency to recognize nonlinear faces with an acceptance ratio of more than 90% and execution time of only few seconds.

人脸检测和识别已经在研究学者中流行起来，并且已经有多种方法被纳入到服务目的中。生物识别分析系统（可能是全身扫描仪），或者虹膜检测识别系统和指纹识别系统以及为了安全和安保目的而部署的监视系统的猖獗的出现促成了对这种系统的倾向。已经取得了进展，正面，侧面的面部表情或使用面部表情，如愤怒，快乐和忧郁，静止图像和视频图像用于检测和识别。这导致了更新的人脸检测和识别方法，以实现准确的结果和经济上可行和非常安全。诸如主成分分析（PCA），独立分量分析（ICA），线性判别分析（LDA）等技术一直是主要使用的技术。但是，以前的方法需要进行改进基于神经网络的识别对行业来说是一种福音。这不仅提高了认识，而且提高了过程的效率。选择反向传播作为学习方法显然不能有效识别非线性人脸，其接受率超过90％，执行时间只有几秒钟。
