##### Abstract
This paper introduces a novel neural network model for question answering, the \emph{entity-based memory network}. It enhances neural networks' ability of representing and calculating information over a long period by keeping records of entities contained in text. The core component is a memory pool which comprises entities' states. These entities' states are continuously updated according to the input text. Questions with regard to the input text are used to search the memory pool for related entities and answers are further predicted based on the states of retrieved entities. Compared with previous memory network models, the proposed model is capable of handling fine-grained information and more sophisticated relations based on entities. We formulated several different tasks as question answering problems and tested the proposed model. Experiments reported satisfying results.

本文介绍了一个新颖的问题回答神经网络模型，基于实体的内存网络。它通过保持文本中包含的实体的记录来增强神经网络长时间表示和计算信息的能力。核心组件是包含实体状态的内存池。这些实体的状态根据输入的文本不断更新。关于输入文本的问题被用于在存储池中搜索相关实体，并且基于检索到的实体的状态来进一步预测答案。与以前的记忆网络模型相比，所提出的模型能够处理基于实体的细粒度信息和更复杂的关系。我们制定了几个不同的任务作为问题回答问题，并测试了提出的模型。实验报告了满意的结果。
