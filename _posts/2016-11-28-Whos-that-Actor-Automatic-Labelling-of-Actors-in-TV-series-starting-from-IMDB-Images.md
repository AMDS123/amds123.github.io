##### Abstract
In this work, we aim at automatically labeling actors in a TV series. Rather than relying on transcripts and subtitles, as has been demonstrated in the past, we show how to achieve this goal starting from a set of example images of each of the main actors involved, collected from the Internet Movie Database (IMDB). The problem then becomes one of domain adaptation: actors' IMDB photos are typically taken at awards ceremonies and are quite different from their appearances in TV series. In each series as well, there is considerable change in actor appearance due to makeup, lighting, ageing, etc. To bridge this gap, we propose a graph-matching based self-labelling algorithm, which we coin HSL (Hungarian Self Labeling). Further, we propose a new edge cost to be used in this context, as well as an extension that is more robust to outliers, where prototypical faces for each of the actors are selected based on a hierarchical clustering procedure. We conduct experiments with 15 episodes from 3 different TV series and demonstrate automatic annotation with an accuracy of 90% and up.

在这项工作中，我们的目标是在电视连续剧中为演员自动添加标签。正如过去已经证明的那样，我们不是依靠成绩单和字幕，而是从如何从互联网电影数据库（IMDB）收集的每个主要参与者的示例图像开始实现这个目标。这个问题就变成了领域适应：演员们的IMDB照片通常是在颁奖典礼上拍摄的，与电视剧中的表演截然不同。在每个系列中，由于化妆，灯光，老化等因素，演员的外观都有相当大的变化。为弥补这一差距，我们提出了一种基于图形匹配的自标签算法，我们将HSL（匈牙利自标签）硬币化。此外，我们提出了在这种情况下使用的新的边缘成本，以及对异常值更强健的扩展，其中基于分层聚类过程来选择每个参与者的原型面孔。我们从3个不同的电视剧中进行了15集的实验，并以90％以上的精度展示了自动注释。
