##### Abstract
In this paper we explain how we deal with the problems related to the constitution of the Aliento database, the complexity of which has to do with the type of phrases we work with, the differences between languages, the type of information we want to see emerge. The correct tagging of the specific polysemy of brief sapiential units is an important step in the preparation of the text within the corpus which will be submitted to compute similarities and posterity of the units.
