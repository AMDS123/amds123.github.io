##### Abstract
Microblog has become a popular platform for people to post, share, and seek information due to its convenience and low cost. However, it also facilitates the generation and propagation of fake news, which could cause detrimental societal consequences. Detecting fake news on microblogs is important for societal good. Emotion is a significant indicator while verifying information on social media. Existing fake news detection studies utilize emotion mainly through users stances or simple statistical emotional features; and exploiting the emotion information from both news content and user comments is also limited. In the realistic scenarios, to impress the audience and spread extensively, the publishers typically either post a tweet with intense emotion which could easily resonate with the crowd, or post a controversial statement unemotionally but aim to evoke intense emotion among the users. Therefore, in this paper, we study the novel problem of exploiting emotion information for fake news detection. We propose a new Emotion-based Fake News Detection framework (EFN), which can i) learn content- and comment- emotion representations for publishers and users respectively; and ii) exploit content and social emotions simultaneously for fake news detection. Experimental results on real-world dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework.
