##### Abstract
The logic-based machine-understandable framework of the Semantic Web often challenges naive users when they try to query ontology-based knowledge bases. Existing research efforts have approached this problem by introducing Natural Language (NL) interfaces to ontologies. These NL interfaces have the ability to construct SPARQL queries based on NL user queries. However, most efforts were restricted to queries expressed in English, and they often benefited from the advancement of English NLP tools. However, little research has been done to support querying the Arabic content on the Semantic Web by using NL queries. This paper presents a domain-independent approach to translate Arabic NL queries to SPARQL by leveraging linguistic analysis. Based on a special consideration on Noun Phrases (NPs), our approach uses a language parser to extract NPs and the relations from Arabic parse trees and match them to the underlying ontology. It then utilizes knowledge in the ontology to group NPs into triple-based representations. A SPARQL query is finally generated by extracting targets and modifiers, and interpreting them into SPARQL. The interpretation of advanced semantic features including negation, conjunctive and disjunctive modifiers is also supported. The approach was evaluated by using two datasets consisting of OWL test data and queries, and the obtained results have confirmed its feasibility to translate Arabic NL queries to SPARQL.

语义网的基于逻辑的机器可理解的框架经常在试图查询基于本体的知识库时挑战朴素的用户。现有的研究工作已经通过向本体引入自然语言（NL）接口来解决这个问题。这些NL接口能够基于NL用户查询构造SPARQL查询。然而，大部分努力仅限于用英语表达的疑问，而且他们通常从英语自然语言处理工具的进步中受益。然而，很少有研究支持通过使用NL查询来查询语义网上的阿拉伯文内容。本文提出了一种独立于域的方法，通过利用语言分析来将阿拉伯语NL查询翻译成SPARQL。基于对名词短语（NPs）的特殊考虑，我们的方法使用语言解析器从阿拉伯语解析树中提取NP和关系，并将其与基础本体进行匹配。然后利用本体中的知识将NP分成三重表示。最终通过提取目标和修饰符并将其解释为SPARQL来生成SPARQL查询。还支持对高级语义特征的解释，包括否定，连接和分离修饰符。通过使用由OWL测试数据和查询组成的两个数据集来评估该方法，并且所获得的结果证实了将阿拉伯NL查询翻译成SPARQL的可行性。
