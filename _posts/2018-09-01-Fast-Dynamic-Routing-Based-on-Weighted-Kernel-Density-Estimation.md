##### Abstract
Capsules as well as dynamic routing between them are most recently proposed structures for deep neural networks. A capsule groups data into vectors or matrices as poses rather than conventional scalars to represent specific properties of target instance. Besides of pose, a capsule should be attached with a probability (often denoted as activation) for its presence. The dynamic routing helps capsules achieve more generalization capacity with many fewer model parameters. However, the bottleneck that prevents widespread applications of capsule is the expense of computation during routing. To address this problem, we generalize existing routing methods within the framework of weighted kernel density estimation, and propose two fast routing methods with different optimization strategies. Our methods prompt the time efficiency of routing by nearly 40\% with negligible performance degradation. By stacking a hybrid of convolutional layers and capsule layers, we construct a network architecture to handle inputs at a resolution of $64\times{64}$ pixels. The proposed models achieve a parallel performance with other leading methods in multiple benchmarks.

胶囊以及它们之间的动态路由是最近提出的用于深度神经网络的结构。胶囊将数据分组为矢量或矩阵作为姿势而不是传统的标量来表示目标实例的特定属性。除了姿势之外，胶囊应该以其存在的概率（通常表示为激活）附着。动态路由有助于胶囊通过更少的模型参数实现更多的泛化能力。然而，阻止广泛应用胶囊的瓶颈是在路由期间计算的费用。为了解决这个问题，我们在加权核密度估计的框架内推广了现有的路由方法，并提出了两种具有不同优化策略的快速路由方法。我们的方法将路由的时间效率提高了近40％，而性能降低可忽略不计。通过堆叠卷积层和封装层的混合，我们构建了一个网络架构来处理分辨率为64美元{64} $像素的输入。所提出的模型在多个基准测试中与其他领先方法实现了并行性能。
