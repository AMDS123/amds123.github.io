##### Abstract
Backdoors and backbones of Boolean formulas are hidden structural properties. A natural goal, already in part realized, is that solver algorithms seek to obtain substantially better performance by exploiting these structures. 
 However, the present paper is not intended to improve the performance of SAT solvers, but rather is a cautionary paper. In particular, the theme of this paper is that there is a potential chasm between the existence of such structures in the Boolean formula and being able to effectively exploit them. This does not mean that these structures are not useful to solvers. It does mean that one must be very careful not to assume that it is computationally easy to go from the existence of a structure to being able to get one's hands on it and/or being able to exploit the structure. 
 For example, in this paper we show that, under the assumption that P $\neq$ NP, there are easily recognizable families of Boolean formulas with strong backdoors that are easy to find, yet for which it is hard (in fact, NP-complete) to determine whether the formulas are satisfiable. We also show that, also under the assumption P $\neq$ NP, there are easily recognizable sets of Boolean formulas for which it is hard (in fact, NP-complete) to determine whether they have a large backbone.

布尔公式的后门和骨干是隐藏的结构属性。已经部分实现的自然目标是求解器算法通过利用这些结构寻求获得显着更好的性能。
 然而，本文并非旨在改善SAT求解器的性能，而是一个警示性的论文。特别是，本文的主题是布尔公式中存在这种结构之间存在潜在的鸿沟，并且能够有效地利用它们。这并不意味着这些结构对解算器没用。它确实意味着必须非常小心，不要假设从结构的存在到能够获得一个人和/或能够利用该结构在计算上容易。
 例如，在本文中，我们表明，在P $ \ neq $ NP的假设下，有很容易识别的布尔公式族具有强大的后门，很容易找到，但是很难（实际上，NP-完成）确定公式是否可满足。我们还表明，在P $ \ neq $ NP的假设下，还有很容易识别的布尔公式集，很难确定它们是否很难（实际上是NP完全的），以确定它们是否具有较大的主干。
