##### Abstract
Computed tomography imaging is a standard modality for detecting and assessing lung cancer. In order to evaluate the malignancy of lung nodules, clinical practice often involves expert qualitative ratings on several criteria describing a nodule's appearance and shape. Translating these features for computer-aided diagnostics is challenging due to their subjective nature and the difficulties in gaining a complete description. In this paper, we propose a computerized approach to quantitatively evaluate both appearance distinctions and 3D surface variations. Nodule shape was modeled and parameterized using spherical harmonics, and appearance features were extracted using deep convolutional neural networks. Both sets of features were combined to estimate the nodule malignancy using a random forest classifier. The proposed algorithm was tested on the publicly available Lung Image Database Consortium dataset, achieving high accuracy. By providing lung nodule characterization, this method can provide a robust alternative reference opinion for lung cancer diagnosis.

计算机断层扫描成像是检测和评估肺癌的标准方式。为了评估肺结节的恶性程度，临床实践往往涉及几个标准描述结节的外观和形状的专家定性评级。将这些特征转换为计算机辅助诊断是具有挑战性的，因为它们的主观性质和获得完整描述的困难。在本文中，我们提出了一种计算机化的方法来定量评估外观差异和三维表面变化。使用球谐函数对结节形状进行建模和参数化，并使用深度卷积神经网络提取外形特征。使用随机森林分类器将两组特征组合起来估计结节恶性肿瘤。提出的算法在公开的肺图像数据库联盟数据集上进行测试，实现了高精度。通过提供肺结节表征，该方法可以为肺癌诊断提供一个强有力的替代参考意见。
