##### Abstract
Acoustic models of resonant duct systems with turbulent flow depend on fitted constants based on expensive experimental test series. We introduce a new model of a resonant cavity, flush mounted in a duct or flat plate, under grazing turbulent flow. Based on previous work by Goody, Howe and Golliard, we present a more universal model where the constants are replaced by physically significant parameters. This enables the user to understand and to trace back how a modification of design parameters (geometry, fluid condition) will affect acoustic properties. The derivation of the model is supported by a detailed three-dimensional direct numerical simulation as well as an experimental test series. We show that the model is valid for low Mach number flows (M = 0.01-0.14) and for low frequencies (below higher transverse cavity modes). Hence, within this range, no expensive simulation or experiment is needed any longer to predict the sound spectrum. In principle, the model is applicable to arbitrary geometries: Just the provided definitions need to be applied to update the significant parameters. Utilizing the lumped-element method, the model consists of exchangeable elements and guarantees a flexible use. Even though the model is linear, resonance conditions between acoustic cavity modes and fluid dynamic unstable modes are correctly predicted.
