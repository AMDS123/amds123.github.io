##### Abstract
We present ab initio calculations on the effect of in-plane equi-biaxial strain on the structural and electronic properties of hypothetical graphene-like GaN monolayer (ML-GaN). It was found that ML-GaN got buckled for compressive strain in excess of 7.281 %; buckling parameter increased quadratic-ally with compressive strain. The 2D bulk modulus of ML-GaN was found to be smaller than that of graphene and graphene-like ML-BN, which reflects weaker bond in ML-GaN. More importantly, the band gap and effective masses of charge carriers in ML-GaN were found to be tunable by application of in-plane equi-biaxial strain. In particular, when compressive biaxial strain of about 3 % was reached, a transition from indirect to direct band gap-phase occurred with significant change in the value and nature of effective masses of charge carriers; buckling and tensile strain reduced the band gap - the band gap reduced to 50 % of its unstrained value at 6.36 % tensile strain and to 0 eV at an extrapolated tensile strain of 12.72 %, which is well within its predicted ultimate tensile strain limit of 16 %. These predictions of strain-engineered electronic properties of highly strain sensitive ML-GaN may be exploited in future for potential applications in strain sensors and other nano-devices such as the nano-electromechanical systems (NEMS).

我们从头计算平面内的等轴双轴应变对假设的石墨烯样GaN单层（ML-GaN）的结构和电子性质的影响。发现ML-GaN压缩应变超过7.281％;屈曲参数随压缩应变呈二次曲线上升。发现ML-GaN的二维体积模量小于石墨烯和类石墨烯ML-BN的二维体积模量，这反映了ML-GaN中较弱的键。更重要的是，ML-GaN中载流子的带隙和有效质量被发现可以通过使用平面内的等轴双轴应变来调节。特别是在达到约3％的压缩双轴应变时，发生从间接到直接带隙相的转变，载流子有效质量的值和性质发生显着变化;屈曲和拉伸应变使带隙减小 - 在6.36％的拉伸应变下带隙减小到其无应变值的50％，并且在12.72％的外推拉伸应变下减小到0eV，这在其预测的极限拉伸应变极限16 ％。高度应变敏感的ML-GaN的应变工程电子性质的这些预测可能在将来被用于应变传感器和其他纳米装置如纳米机电系统（NEMS）中的潜在应用。
