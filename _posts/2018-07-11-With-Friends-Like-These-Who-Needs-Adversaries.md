##### Abstract
The vulnerability of deep image classification networks to adversarial attack is now well known, but less well understood. Via a novel experimental analysis, we illustrate some facts about deep convolutional networks (DCNs) that shed new light on their behaviour and its connection to the problem of adversaries, with two key results. The first is a straightforward explanation of the existence of universal adversarial perturbations and their association with specific class identities, obtained by analysing the properties of nets' logit responses as functions of 1D movements along specific image-space directions. The second is the clear demonstration of the tight coupling between classification performance and vulnerability to adversarial attack within the spaces spanned by these directions. Prior work has noted the importance of low-dimensional subspaces in adversarial vulnerability: we illustrate that this likewise represents the nets' notion of saliency. In all, we provide a digestible perspective from which to understand previously reported results which have appeared disjoint or contradictory, with implications for efforts to construct neural nets that are both accurate and robust to adversarial attack.

深度图像分类网络对敌对攻击的脆弱性现在众所周知，但不太了解。通过一个新的实验分析，我们说明了一些关于深度卷积网络（DCN）的事实，这些事实揭示了它们的行为及其与对手问题的联系，有两个关键结果。第一个是对通用对抗性扰动的存在及其与特定类别身份的关联的直接解释，通过分析网络对数响应的特性作为沿特定图像空间方向的一维运动的函数而获得。第二个是清楚地证明了分类性能与这些方向所跨越的空间内的对抗性攻击之间的紧密联系。先前的工作已经注意到低维子空间在对抗性脆弱性中的重要性：我们说明这同样代表了网络的显着性概念。总而言之，我们提供了一个可消化的视角，从中可以了解先前报告的结果，这些结果似乎是不相交的或矛盾的，对于构建对抗攻击的准确和强大的神经网的努力具有意义。
