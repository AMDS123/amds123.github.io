##### Abstract
The study of human-robot interaction is fundamental to the design and use of robotics in real-world applications. Robots will need to predict and adapt to the actions of human collaborators in order to achieve good performance and improve safety and end-user adoption. This paper evaluates a human-robot collaboration scheme that combines the task allocation and motion levels of reasoning: the robotic agent uses Bayesian inference to predict the next goal of its human partner from his or her ongoing motion, and re-plans its own actions in real time. This anticipative adaptation is desirable in many practical scenarios, where humans are unable or unwilling to take on the cognitive overhead required to explicitly communicate their intent to the robot. A behavioral experiment indicates that the combination of goal inference and dynamic task planning significantly improves both objective and perceived performance of the human-robot team. Participants were highly sensitive to the differences between robot behaviors, preferring to work with a robot that adapted to their actions over one that did not.

人机交互的研究是机器人在实际应用中的设计和使用的基础。机器人将需要预测和适应人类合作者的行为，以获得良好的性能，并提高安全性和最终用户的采用。本文评估了一种将推理的任务分配和运动水平相结合的人机协作方案：机器人代理使用贝叶斯推理来预测其人类伙伴的下一个目标，并重新计划自己的行动即时的。在许多实际的情况下，这种预期的适应是合乎需要的，在这种情况下，人类不能或不愿意承担明确表达他们意图给机器人所需的认知开销。行为实验表明，目标推断和动态任务规划的结合显着提高了人机器人团队的客观和感知性能。参与者对机器人行为之间的差异非常敏感，他们更喜欢与机器人一起工作，而这种机器人却不适合自己的行为。
