##### Abstract
Iris is one of the popular biometrics that is widely used for identity authentication. Different features have been used to perform iris recognition in the past. Most of them are based on hand-crafted features designed by biometrics experts. Due to tremendous success of deep learning in computer vision problems, there has been a lot of interest in applying features learned by convolutional neural networks on general image recognition to other tasks such as segmentation, face recognition, and object detection. In this paper, we have investigated the application of deep features extracted from VGG-Net for iris recognition. The proposed scheme has been tested on two well-known iris databases, and has shown promising results with the best accuracy rate of 99.4\%, which outperforms the previous best result.

虹膜是广泛用于身份认证的流行生物特征之一。过去已经使用了不同的特征来进行虹膜识别。其中大部分是基于生物识别专家设计的手工功能。由于计算机视觉问题深度学习的巨大成功，人们对将卷积神经网络学习到的特征应用于普通图像识别的其他任务（如分割，人脸识别和物体检测）产生了浓厚的兴趣。在本文中，我们研究了从VGG-Net提取的深度特征用于虹膜识别的应用。提出的方案已经在两个着名的虹膜数据库上进行了测试，结果表现出良好的效果，最高的准确率达到了99.4％，比以前的最好。
