##### Abstract
State-of-the-art English automatic speech recognition systems typically use phonetic rather than graphemic lexicons. Graphemic systems are known to perform less well for English as the mapping from the written form to the spoken form is complicated. However, in recent years the representational power of deep-learning based acoustic models has improved, raising interest in graphemic acoustic models for English, due to the simplicity of generating the lexicon. In this paper, phonetic and graphemic models are compared for an English Multi-Genre Broadcast transcription task. A range of acoustic models based on lattice-free MMI training are constructed using phonetic and graphemic lexicons. For this task, it is found that having a long-span temporal history reduces the difference in performance between the two forms of models. In addition, system combination is examined, using parameter smoothing and hypothesis combination. As the combination approaches become more complicated the difference between the phonetic and graphemic systems further decreases. Finally, for all configurations examined the combination of phonetic and graphemic systems yields consistent gains.

最先进的英语自动语音识别系统通常使用语音而不是字形词典。已知字面系统对英语表现不佳，因为从书面形式到口语形式的映射是复杂的。然而，近年来，基于深度学习的声学模型的代表性力量已经提高，由于生成词典的简单性，对英语的词素声学模型的兴趣提高。在本文中，拼音和字形模型比较英语多种类型广播转录任务。基于无格MMI训练的一系列声学模型是使用拼音和字形词典构建的。对于这个任务，发现具有长时间的时间历史减少了两种模型之间的性能差异。另外，系统组合检查，使用参数平滑和假设组合。随着组合方法变得越来越复杂，语音和文体系统之间的差异进一步减小。最后，对于所有被检测的配置，语音和字形系统的组合产生一致的收益。
