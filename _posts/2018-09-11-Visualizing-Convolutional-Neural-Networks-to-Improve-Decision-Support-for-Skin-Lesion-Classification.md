##### Abstract
Because of their state-of-the-art performance in computer vision, CNNs are becoming increasingly popular in a variety of fields, including medicine. However, as neural networks are black box function approximators, it is difficult, if not impossible, for a medical expert to reason about their output. This could potentially result in the expert distrusting the network when he or she does not agree with its output. In such a case, explaining why the CNN makes a certain decision becomes valuable information. In this paper, we try to open the black box of the CNN by inspecting and visualizing the learned feature maps, in the field of dermatology. We show that, to some extent, CNNs focus on features similar to those used by dermatologists to make a diagnosis. However, more research is required for fully explaining their output.

由于其在计算机视觉方面的最先进性能，CNN在包括医学在内的各种领域中变得越来越流行。然而，由于神经网络是黑盒函数逼近器，因此医学专家很难（如果不是不可能的话）推断其输出。当他或她不同意其输出时，这可能导致专家不信任网络。在这种情况下，解释CNN作出某种决定的原因成为有价值的信息。在本文中，我们尝试通过检查和可视化皮肤病领域中的学习特征图来打开CNN的黑匣子。我们表明，在某种程度上，CNN关注的特征类似于皮肤科医生用于诊断的特征。但是，需要更多的研究来充分解释它们的输出。
