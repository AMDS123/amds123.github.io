##### Abstract
Visually impaired people are integral part of the society and it has been a must to provide them with means and system through which they may communicate with the world. In this work, I would like to address how computers can be made useful to read the scripts in Braille. The importance of this work is to reduce communication gap between visually impaired people and the society. Braille remains the most popular tactile reading code even in this century. There are numerous amount of literature locked up in Braille. Braille recognition not only reduces time in reading or extracting information from Braille document but also helps people engaged in special education for correcting papers and other school related works. The availability of such a system will enhance communication and collaboration possibilities with visually impaired people. Existing works supports only documents in white either bright or dull in colour. Hardly any work could be traced on hand printed ordinary documents in Braille.

##### Abstract (translated by Google)
视障者是社会不可分割的一部分，必须为他们提供与世界沟通的手段和制度。在这项工作中，我想说明如何使计算机能够用盲文阅读脚本。这项工作的重要性在于减少视障人士和社会之间的沟通差距。即使在本世纪盲文依然是最流行的触觉阅读代码。盲文中有大量文献被锁定。盲文识别不仅减少了阅读盲文文件或提取信息的时间，而且还帮助从事特殊教育的人士修改论文和其他与学校有关的作品。这样一个系统的可用性将加强与视障人士的交流和合作的可能性。现有的作品仅支持白色的文档，无论是明亮的还是暗淡的。手工印刷盲文普通文件几乎没有任何工作可以追查。
