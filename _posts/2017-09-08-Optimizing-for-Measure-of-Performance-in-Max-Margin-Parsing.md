##### Abstract
Many statistical learning problems in the area of natural language processing including sequence tagging, sequence segmentation and syntactic parsing has been successfully approached by means of structured prediction methods. An appealing property of the corresponding discriminative learning algorithms is their ability to integrate the loss function of interest directly into the optimization process, which potentially can increase the resulting performance accuracy. Here, we demonstrate on the example of constituency parsing how to optimize for F1-score in the max-margin framework of structural SVM. In particular, the optimization is with respect to the original (not binarized) trees.

自然语言处理领域的许多统计学习问题，包括序列标注，序列分割和句法分析，已经通过结构化预测方法成功地被接近。相应的判别式学习算法的吸引人的性质是它们将感兴趣的损失函数直接集成到优化过程中的能力，这可能会增加所得到的性能准确性。在这里，我们以构建支持向量机的最大边界框架为例，解释如何优化F1分数。特别是，优化是关于原始（而不是二元化）的树木。
