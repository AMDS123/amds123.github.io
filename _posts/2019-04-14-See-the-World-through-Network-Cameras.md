##### Abstract
Millions of network cameras have been deployed worldwide. Real-time data from many network cameras can offer instant views of multiple locations with applications in public safety, transportation management, urban planning, agriculture, forestry, social sciences, atmospheric information, and more. This paper describes the real-time data available from worldwide network cameras and potential applications. Second, this paper outlines the CAM2 System available to users at https://www.cam2project.net/. This information includes strategies to discover network cameras and create the camera database, user interface, and computing platforms. Third, this paper describes many opportunities provided by data from network cameras and challenges to be addressed.
