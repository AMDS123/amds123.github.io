##### Abstract
This paper is first-line research expanding GANs into graph topology analysis. By leveraging the hierarchical connectivity structure of a graph, we have demonstrated that generative adversarial networks (GANs) can successfully capture topological features of any arbitrary graph, and rank edge sets by different stages according to their contribution to topology reconstruction. Moreover, in addition to acting as an indicator of graph reconstruction, we find that these stages can also preserve important topological features in a graph.

本文是将GANs拓展到图形拓扑分析的一线研究。通过利用图的层次连接结构，我们证明了生成对抗网络（GANs）能够成功地捕获任意图的拓扑特征，并根据拓扑重构对拓扑重构的贡献对不同阶段的边集进行排序。而且，除了作为图形重构的指标之外，我们还发现这些阶段也可以在图形中保留重要的拓扑特征。
