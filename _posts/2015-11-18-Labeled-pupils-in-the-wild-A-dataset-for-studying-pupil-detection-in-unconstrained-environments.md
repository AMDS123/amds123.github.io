##### Abstract
We present labelled pupils in the wild (LPW), a novel dataset of 66 high-quality, high-speed eye region videos for the development and evaluation of pupil detection algorithms. The videos in our dataset were recorded from 22 participants in everyday locations at about 95 FPS using a state-of-the-art dark-pupil head-mounted eye tracker. They cover people with different ethnicities, a diverse set of everyday indoor and outdoor illumination environments, as well as natural gaze direction distributions. The dataset also includes participants wearing glasses, contact lenses, as well as make-up. We benchmark five state-of-the-art pupil detection algorithms on our dataset with respect to robustness and accuracy. We further study the influence of image resolution, vision aids, as well as recording location (indoor, outdoor) on pupil detection performance. Our evaluations provide valuable insights into the general pupil detection problem and allow us to identify key challenges for robust pupil detection on head-mounted eye trackers.

我们在野外标记瞳孔（LPW），一个66个高质量，高速眼部视频的新数据集，用于瞳孔检测算法的开发和评估。我们的数据集中的视频是从22位参与者以每分钟95帧的速度记录下来的，使用最先进的暗瞳头戴式眼动仪。它们涵盖了不同种族，不同种类的日常室内和室外照明环境，以及自然的视线方向分布。数据集还包括戴眼镜，隐形眼镜以及化妆的参与者。我们在我们的数据集上针对鲁棒性和准确性对五种最先进的瞳孔检测算法进行了基准测试。我们进一步研究图像分辨率，视觉辅助以及记录位置（室内，室外）对瞳孔检测性能的影响。我们的评估为普遍的学生发现问题提供了宝贵的见解，使我们能够确定在头戴式眼动仪上进行强大的瞳孔检测所面临的关键挑战。
