##### Abstract
Environmental monitoring of marine environments presents several challenges: the harshness of the environment, the often remote location, and most importantly, the vast area it covers. Manual operations are time consuming, often dangerous, and labor intensive. Operations from oceanographic vessels are costly and limited to open seas and generally deeper bodies of water. In addition, with lake, river, and ocean shoreline being a finite resource, waterfront property presents an ever increasing valued commodity, requiring exploration and continued monitoring of remote waterways. In order to efficiently explore and monitor currently known marine environments as well as reach and explore remote areas of interest, we present a design of an autonomous surface vehicle (ASV) with the power to cover large areas, the payload capacity to carry sufficient power and sensor equipment, and enough fuel to remain on task for extended periods. An analysis of the design and a discussion on lessons learned during deployments is presented in this paper.

海洋环境的环境监测带来了一些挑战：环境的恶劣，通常是偏远的地方，最重要的是，它覆盖的广阔区域。手动操作耗时，通常是危险的，并且是劳动密集型的。海洋船舶的操作成本高昂，仅限于公海和一般较深的水体。此外，由于湖泊，河流和海洋海岸线是有限的资源，海滨物业呈现出越来越有价值的商品，需要勘探和持续监测远程水道。为了有效地探索和监测目前已知的海洋环境以及到达和探索感兴趣的偏远地区，我们提出了一种自主地面车辆（ASV）的设计，其具有覆盖大面积的能力，有效载荷能力以及传感器设备和足够的燃料可以长时间保持任务。本文介绍了设计分析和部署过程中的经验教训。
