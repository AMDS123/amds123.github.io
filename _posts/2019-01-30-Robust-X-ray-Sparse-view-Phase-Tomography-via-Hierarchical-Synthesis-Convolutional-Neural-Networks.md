##### Abstract
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) based image reconstruction methods have been intensely used for X-ray computed tomography (CT) reconstruction applications. Despite great success, good performance of this data-based approach critically relies on a representative big training data set and a dense convoluted deep network. The indiscriminating convolution connections over all dense layers could be prone to over-fitting, where sampling biases are wrongly integrated as features for the reconstruction. In this paper, we report a robust hierarchical synthesis reconstruction approach, where training data is pre-processed to separate the information on the domains where sampling biases are suspected. These split bands are then trained separately and combined successively through a hierarchical synthesis network. We apply the hierarchical synthesis reconstruction for two important and classical tomography reconstruction scenarios: the spares-view reconstruction and the phase reconstruction. Our simulated and experimental results show that comparable or improved performances are achieved with a dramatic reduction of network complexity and computational cost. This method can be generalized to a wide range of applications including material characterization, in-vivo monitoring and dynamic 4D imaging.
