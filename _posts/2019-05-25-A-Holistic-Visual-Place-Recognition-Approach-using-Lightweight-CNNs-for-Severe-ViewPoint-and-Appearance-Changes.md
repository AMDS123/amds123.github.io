##### Abstract
This paper presents a lightweight visual place recognition approach, capable of achieving high performance with low computational cost, and feasible for mobile robotics under severe viewpoint and appearance changes. Results on several benchmark datasets confirm an average boost of 10% in accuracy, and 5% average speedup relative to state-of-the-art methods.
