##### Abstract
The relaxation process of electron spin in systems of electrons interacting with piezoelectric deformation phonons that are mediated through spin-orbit interactions was interpreted from a microscopic point of view using the formula for the electron spin relaxation times derived by a projection-reduction method. The electron spin relaxation times in two polymorphic structures of GaN were calculated. The piezoelectric material constant for the wurtzite structure obtained by a comparison with a previously reported experimental result was P_pe=1.5 x 10^29 eV/m. The temperature and magnetic field dependence of the relaxation times for both wurtzite and zinc-blende structures were similar, but the relaxation times in zinc-blende GaN were smaller and decreased more rapidly with increasing temperature and magnetic field than that in wurtzite GaN. This study also showed that the electron spin relaxation for wurtzite GaN at low density could be explained by the Elliot-Yafet process but not for zinc-blende GaN in the metallic regime.

电子自旋与压电变形声子相互作用的系统中的自旋 - 轨道相互作用的弛豫过程从微观角度来解释，使用投影 - 还原方法得到的电子自旋弛豫时间公式。计算了GaN两种多晶型结构的电子自旋弛豫时间。通过与先前报道的实验结果的比较获得的纤锌矿结构的压电材料常数为P_pe = 1.5×10 ^ 29eV / m。纤锌矿和闪锌矿结构的弛豫时间的温度和磁场依赖性是相似的，但闪锌矿GaN的弛豫时间较小，随着温度和磁场的增加，弛豫时间比纤锌矿GaN缓慢。这项研究还表明，在低密度下纤锌矿GaN的电子自旋弛豫可以用Elliot-Yafet工艺来解释，但在金属状态下则不能用闪锌矿GaN来解释。
