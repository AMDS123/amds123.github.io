##### Abstract
We introduce a framework for designing multi-scale, adaptive, shift-invariant frames and bi-frames for representing signals. The new framework, called AdaFrame, improves over dictionary learning-based techniques in terms of computational efficiency at inference time. It improves classical multi-scale basis such as wavelet frames in terms of coding efficiency. It provides an attractive alternative to dictionary learning-based techniques for low level signal processing tasks, such as compression and denoising, as well as high level tasks, such as feature extraction for object recognition. Connections with deep convolutional networks are also discussed. In particular, the proposed framework reveals a drawback in the commonly used approach for visualizing the activations of the intermediate layers in convolutional networks, and suggests a natural alternative.

我们引入了一个设计多尺度，自适应，平移不变帧和双帧来表示信号的框架。称为AdaFrame的新框架在推理时间的计算效率方面改善了基于字典学习的技术。它在编码效率方面改进了小波帧等经典的多尺度基础。它为基于字典学习的技术提供了一个有吸引力的替代方案，用于低级信号处理任务（如压缩和去噪）以及高级任务（如用于对象识别的特征提取）。还讨论了与深卷积网络的连接。具体而言，所提出的框架揭示了用于可视化卷积网络中间层的激活的常用方法的缺点，并且提出了一种自然的选择。
