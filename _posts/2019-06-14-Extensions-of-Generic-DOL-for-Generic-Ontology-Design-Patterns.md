##### Abstract
Generic ontologies were introduced as an extension (Generic DOL) of the Distributed Ontology, Modeling and Specification Language, DOL, with the aim to provide a language for Generic Ontology Design Patterns. In this paper we present a number of new language constructs that increase the expressivity and the generality of Generic DOL, among them sequential and optional parameters, list parameters with recursion, and local sub-patterns. These are illustrated with non-trivial patterns: generic value sets and (nested) qualitatively graded relations, demonstrated as definitional building blocks in an application domain.
