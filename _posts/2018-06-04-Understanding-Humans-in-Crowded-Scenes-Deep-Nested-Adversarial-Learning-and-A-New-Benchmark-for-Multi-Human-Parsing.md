##### Abstract
Despite the noticeable progress in perceptual tasks like detection, instance segmentation and human parsing, computers still perform unsatisfactorily on visually understanding humans in crowded scenes, such as group behavior analysis, person re-identification and autonomous driving, etc. To this end, models need to comprehensively perceive the semantic information and the differences between instances in a multi-human image, which is recently defined as the multi-human parsing task. In this paper, we present a new large-scale database "Multi-Human Parsing (MHP)" for algorithm development and evaluation, and advances the state-of-the-art in understanding humans in crowded scenes. MHP contains 25,403 elaborately annotated images with 58 fine-grained semantic category labels, involving 2-26 persons per image and captured in real-world scenes from various viewpoints, poses, occlusion, interactions and background. We further propose a novel deep Nested Adversarial Network (NAN) model for multi-human parsing. NAN consists of three Generative Adversarial Network (GAN)-like sub-nets, respectively performing semantic saliency prediction, instance-agnostic parsing and instance-aware clustering. These sub-nets form a nested structure and are carefully designed to learn jointly in an end-to-end way. NAN consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art solutions on our MHP and several other datasets, and serves as a strong baseline to drive the future research for multi-human parsing.

尽管在检测，实例分割和人类解析等感知任务方面取得了令人瞩目的进步，但在计算机集群行为分析，人员重新识别和自动驾驶等拥挤的场景中，人们对视觉理解人类的能力仍然不尽人意。为此，模型需要以全面地感知最近被定义为多人解析任务的多人图像中的语义信息和实例之间的差异。在本文中，我们提出了一个用于算法开发和评估的新型大规模数据库“多人解析（MHP）”，并且在拥挤的场景中提高了对人类理解的最新技术。 MHP包含25,403个精心注释的图像，包含58个细粒度的语义类别标签，每个图像包含2-26个人，并从各种视点，姿势，遮挡，交互和背景在真实场景中捕捉。我们进一步提出了一种用于多人分析的新型深度嵌套对抗网络（NAN）模型。 NAN包括三个分别执行语义显着性预测，实例不可知分析和实例感知聚类的生成对抗网络（GAN）状子网。这些子网形成嵌套结构，并经过精心设计，以端到端的方式共同学习。 NAN始终比我们MHP和其他数据库上现有的最先进的解决方案更胜一筹，并且为推动未来多人解析研究奠定了坚实的基础。
