##### Abstract
Automatic mapping of buildings from remote sensing imagery is currently limited by insufficient detection accuracy. A recent technique that can largely promote the building detection accuracy is convolutional neural network, which is an important branch of deep learning and has substantially improved the state-of-the-art performance of image segmentation. A benchmark dataset bears significance in fair comparisons for further accelerating the development of building detection toward automatic mapping. However, several problems still remain in the current public datasets that address this task. First, although building detection is generally considered equivalent to extracting roof outlines, most datasets directly provide building footprints as ground truths for testing and evaluation; the challenges of these benchmarks are more complicated than roof segmentation, as relief displacement leads to varying degrees of misalignment between roof outlines and footprints. On the other hand, an image dataset should feature a large quantity and high spatial resolution to effectively train a high-performance deep learning model for accurate mapping of buildings. Unfortunately, the remote sensing community still lacks proper benchmark datasets that can simultaneously satisfy these requirements. In this paper, we present a new large-scale benchmark dataset termed Aerial Imagery for Roof Segmentation (AIRS). This dataset provides a wide coverage of aerial imagery with 7.5 cm resolution and contains over 220,000 buildings. The task posed for AIRS is defined as roof segmentation. We implement several state-of-the-art deep learning methods of semantic segmentation for performance evaluation and analysis of the proposed dataset. The results can serve as the baseline for future work.

目前，遥感图像对建筑物的自动映射受到检测精度不足的限制。最近可以在很大程度上提高建筑物检测精度的技术是卷积神经网络，它是深度学习的重要分支，并且大大提高了图像分割的最新性能。基准数据集在公平比较中具有重要意义，可进一步加速建筑物检测向自动绘图的发展。但是，在解决此任务的当前公共数据集中仍存在一些问题。首先，虽然建筑物检测通常被认为等同于提取屋顶轮廓，但大多数数据集直接提供建筑物足迹作为测试和评估的基本事实;这些基准的挑战比屋顶分割更复杂，因为浮雕位移导致屋顶轮廓和足迹之间的不同程度的不对准。另一方面，图像数据集应具有大量和高空间分辨率，以有效地训练高性能深度学习模型以准确地绘制建筑物。不幸的是，遥感社区仍然缺乏可以同时满足这些要求的适当基准数据集。在本文中，我们提出了一个新的大型基准数据集，称为用于屋顶分割的航空影像（AIRS）。该数据集提供了7.5厘米分辨率的航拍图像的广泛覆盖，包含超过220,000个建筑物。为AIRS提出的任务被定义为屋顶分割。我们实施了几种最先进的语义分割深度学习方法，用于性能评估和分析所提出的数据集。结果可以作为未来工作的基准。
