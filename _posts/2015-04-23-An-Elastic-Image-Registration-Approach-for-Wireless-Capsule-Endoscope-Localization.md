##### Abstract
Wireless Capsule Endoscope (WCE) is an innovative imaging device that permits physicians to examine all the areas of the Gastrointestinal (GI) tract. It is especially important for the small intestine, where traditional invasive endoscopies cannot reach. Although WCE represents an extremely important advance in medical imaging, a major drawback that remains unsolved is the WCE precise location in the human body during its operating time. This is mainly due to the complex physiological environment and the inherent capsule effects during its movement. When an abnormality is detected, in the WCE images, medical doctors do not know precisely where this abnormality is located relative to the intestine and therefore they can not proceed efficiently with the appropriate therapy. The primary objective of the present paper is to give a contribution to WCE localization, using image-based methods. The main focus of this work is on the description of a multiscale elastic image registration approach, its experimental application on WCE videos, and comparison with a multiscale affine registration. The proposed approach includes registrations that capture both rigid-like and non-rigid deformations, due respectively to the rigid-like WCE movement and the elastic deformation of the small intestine originated by the GI peristaltic movement. Under this approach a qualitative information about the WCE speed can be obtained, as well as the WCE location and orientation via projective geometry. The results of the experimental tests with real WCE video frames show the good performance of the proposed approach, when elastic deformations of the small intestine are involved in successive frames, and its superiority with respect to a multiscale affine image registration, which accounts for rigid-like deformations only and discards elastic deformations.

无线胶囊内窥镜（WCE）是一种创新的成像设备，允许医生检查消化道（GI）的所有区域。传统侵入性内镜不能到达的小肠尤为重要。尽管WCE在医学成像方面是一个非常重要的进步，但是仍然没有解决的一个主要缺点是WCE在手术时间内在人体内的精确位置。这主要是由于运动过程中复杂的生理环境和胶囊固有的影响。当检测到异常时，在WCE图像中，医生不能精确地知道该异常相对于肠的位置，因此不能有效地进行适当的治疗。本文的主要目标是使用基于图像的方法为WCE本地化做出贡献。这项工作的主要重点是多尺度弹性图像配准方法的描述，其在WCE视频的实验应用，并与多尺度仿射登记进行比较。所提出的方法包括分别记录类刚性和非刚性变形的记录，分别归因于由GI蠕动运动引起的刚性WCE运动和小肠的弹性变形。在这种方法下，可以获得关于WCE速度的定性信息，以及通过投影几何学的WCE定位和定向。用实际WCE视频帧进行实验测试的结果表明，当连续帧中涉及小肠的弹性变形时，所提出的方法具有良好的性能，并且其在多尺度仿射图像配准方面的优越性，只有变形和丢弃弹性变形。
