##### Abstract
Text classification is a widely studied problem, and it can be considered solved for some domains and under certain circumstances. There are scenarios, however, that have received little or no attention at all, despite its relevance and applicability. One of such scenarios is early text classification, where one needs to know the category of a document by using partial information only. A document is processed as a sequence of terms, and the goal is to devise a method that can make predictions as fast as possible. The importance of this variant of the text classification problem is evident in domains like sexual predator detection, where one wants to identify an offender as early as possible. This paper analyzes the suitability of the standard naive Bayes classifier for approaching this problem. Specifically, we assess its performance when classifying documents after seeing an increasingly number of terms. A simple modification to the standard naive Bayes implementation allows us to make predictions with partial information. To the best of our knowledge naive Bayes has not been used for this purpose before. Throughout an extensive experimental evaluation we show the effectiveness of the classifier for early text classification. What is more, we show that this simple solution is very competitive when compared with state of the art methodologies that are more elaborated. We foresee our work will pave the way for the development of more effective early text classification techniques based in the naive Bayes formulation.

文本分类是一个被广泛研究的问题，在某些领域和某些情况下可以考虑解决。然而，有些情景尽管具有相关性和适用性，但几乎没有受到任何关注。其中一种情况是早期文本分类，其中需要仅使用部分信息来知道文档的类别。一个文档被处理成一系列的术语，目标是设计一个可以尽可能快地进行预测的方法。文本分类问题的这种变体的重要性在诸如性捕食者检测这样的领域中是显而易见的，其中人们希望尽早识别犯罪者。本文分析了标准朴素贝叶斯分类器对于解决这个问题的适用性。具体而言，我们在看到越来越多的术语后对文档进行分类时评估其性能。对标准朴素贝叶斯实现的简单修改使我们能够用部分信息进行预测。据我们所知，幼稚贝叶斯以前从未用于此目的。在整个广泛的实验评估中，我们展示了早期文本分类的分类器的有效性。更重要的是，我们展示了这个简单的解决方案与更先进的方法相比，是非常有竞争力的。我们预见，我们的工作将为开发基于朴素贝叶斯公式的更有效的早期文本分类技术铺平道路。
