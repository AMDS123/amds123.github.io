##### Abstract
A new type of segmentation-based semantic feature (SegSF) for multi-temporal aerial image registration is proposed in this paper. These features encode information about temporally invariant objects such as roads which help deal with the issues such as changing foliage that classical handcrafted features are unable to address. These features are extracted from a semantic segmentation network and show good accuracy in registering aerial images across years and seasons.
