##### Abstract
Generative models, in particular generative adversarial networks (GANs), have received significant attention recently. A number of GAN variants have been proposed and have been utilized in many applications. Despite large strides in terms of theoretical progress, evaluating and comparing GANs remains a daunting task. While several measures have been introduced, as of yet, there is no consensus as to which measure best captures strengths and limitations of models and should be used for fair model comparison. As in other areas of computer vision and machine learning, it is critical to settle on one or few good measures to steer the progress in this field. In this paper, I review and critically discuss more than 24 quantitative and 5 qualitative measures for evaluating generative models with a particular emphasis on GAN-derived models. I also provide a set of 7 desiderata followed by an evaluation of whether a given measure or a family of measures is compatible with them.

生成模型，特别是生成性对抗网络（GAN），最近受到了极大的关注。已经提出了许多GAN变体并且已经在许多应用中使用。尽管在理论进步方面取得了很大进展，但评估和比较GAN仍然是一项艰巨的任务。虽然已经引入了若干措施，但尚未就哪种措施最好地捕捉模型的优势和局限性而达成共识，应该用于公平模型比较。与计算机视觉和机器学习的其他领域一样，必须采取一项或几项良好措施来指导这一领域的进展。在本文中，我回顾并批判性地讨论了用于评估生成模型的超过24种定量和5种定性测量，特别强调了GAN衍生模型。我还提供了一组7个需求，然后评估一个给定的度量或一系列度量是否与它们兼容。
