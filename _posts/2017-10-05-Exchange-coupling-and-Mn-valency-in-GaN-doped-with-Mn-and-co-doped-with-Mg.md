##### Abstract
We study 1 or 2 neighboring Mn impurities, as well as complexes of 1 Mn and 1 or 2 Mg ions in a 64 atoms supercell of GaN by means of density functional calculations. Taking into account the electron correlation in the local spin density approximation with explicit correction of the Hubbard term (the LSDA+U method) and full lattice relaxation we determine the nearest neighbor exchange J for a pair of Mn impurities. We find J to be ferromagnetic and of the order of about 18 meV in the Hamiltonian H=-2*J1*J2. That J is only weakly influenced by the U parameter (varying between 2 and 8 eV) and by the lattice relaxation. From a detailed analysis of the magnetization density distribution we get hints for a ferromagnetic super-exchange mechanism. Also the Mn valence was found to be 3+ without any doubt in the absence of co-doping with Mg. Co-doping with Mg leads to a valence change to 4+ for 1 Mg and to 5+ for 2 Mg. We show that the valence change can already be concluded from a careful analysis of the density of states of GaN doped with Mn without any Mg.

通过密度泛函计算，我们研究了1个或2个邻近的Mn杂质，以及1个Mn和1个或2个Mg离子在64个原子超晶格中的复合物。考虑到在Hubbard项（LSDA + U方法）的显式校正和完全晶格弛豫的局部自旋密度近似中的电子相关性，我们确定一对Mn杂质的最近邻居交换J.我们发现J是铁磁性的，在哈密顿量H = -2 * J1 * J2中约为18meV。 J仅受U参数（在2和8eV之间变化）以及晶格弛豫的弱影响。从对磁化强度分布的详细分析中，我们得到了一个铁磁超交换机制的提示。在没有与Mg共掺杂的情况下，Mn的价态也是毫无疑问的。与Mg共掺杂导致1 Mg的价态变化为4+，2 Mg的价态变化为5+。我们发现，价态的变化已经可以通过仔细分析没有任何Mg的Mn掺杂的GaN的态密度来得出。
