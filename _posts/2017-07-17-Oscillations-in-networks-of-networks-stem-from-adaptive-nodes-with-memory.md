##### Abstract
We present an analytical framework that allows the quantitative study of statistical dynamic properties of networks with adaptive nodes that have memory and is used to examine the emergence of oscillations in networks with response failures. The frequency of the oscillations was quantitatively found to increase with the excitability of the nodes and with the average degree of the network and to decrease with delays between nodes. For networks of networks, diverse cluster oscillation modes were found as a function of the topology. Analytical results are in agreement with large-scale simulations and open the horizon for understanding network dynamics composed of finite memory nodes as well as their different phases of activity.

我们提出了一个分析框架，允许定量研究具有记忆的自适应节点的网络的统计动态特性，并用于检查具有响应失败的网​​络中的振荡的出现。定量地发现振荡的频率随着节点的兴奋性和网络的平均程度而增加，并且随着节点之间的延迟而减小。对于网络网络，发现不同的集群振荡模式作为拓扑的函数。分析结果与大规模模拟结果一致，为理解由有限存储节点组成的网络动力学以及它们不同的活动阶段打开了一个视野。
