##### Abstract
Mapping winter vegetation quality coverage is a challenge problem of remote sensing. This is due to the cloud coverage in winter period, leading to use radar rather than optical images. The objective of this paper is to provide a better understanding of the capabilities of radar Sentinel-1 and deep learning concerning about mapping winter vegetation quality coverage. The analysis presented in this paper is carried out on multi-temporal Sentinel-1 data over the site of La Rochelle, France, during the campaign in December 2016. This dataset were processed in order to produce an intensity radar data stack from October 2016 to February 2017. Two deep Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) based classifier methods were employed. We found that the results of RNNs clearly outperformed the classical machine learning approaches (Support Vector Machine and Random Forest). This study confirms that the time series radar Sentinel-1 and RNNs could be exploited for winter vegetation quality cover mapping.

测绘冬季植被质量覆盖是遥感的一个挑战性问题。这是由于冬季云覆盖，导致使用雷达，而不是光学图像。本文的目的是为了更好地了解雷达哨兵1和深入了解冬季植被质量覆盖图的能力。本文所作的分析是在2016年12月的活动期间在法国拉罗谢尔（La Rochelle）的现场进行的多时间哨兵1数据。该数据集经过处理以生成强度雷达数据栈，从2016年10月至2017年2月。采用两种基于深度递归神经网络（RNN）的分类器方法。我们发现RNN的结果明显优于经典的机器学习方法（支持向量机和随机森林）。本研究证实，时间序列雷达哨兵1号和RNNs可用于冬季植被覆盖度测绘。
