##### Abstract
Machine learning is a field of computer science that builds algorithms that learn. In many cases, machine learning algorithms are used to recreate a human ability like adding a caption to a photo, driving a car, or playing a game. While the human brain has long served as a source of inspiration for machine learning, little effort has been made to directly use data collected from working brains as a guide for machine learning algorithms. Here we demonstrate a new paradigm of "neurally-weighted" machine learning, which takes fMRI measurements of human brain activity from subjects viewing images, and infuses these data into the training process of an object recognition learning algorithm to make it more consistent with the human brain. After training, these neurally-weighted classifiers are able to classify images without requiring any additional neural data. We show that our neural-weighting approach can lead to large performance gains when used with traditional machine vision features, as well as to significant improvements with already high-performing convolutional neural network features. The effectiveness of this approach points to a path forward for a new class of hybrid machine learning algorithms which take both inspiration and direct constraints from neuronal data.

机器学习是计算机科学的一个领域，它建立了学习的算法。在许多情况下，机器学习算法被用来重新创建像添加字幕到照片，驾驶汽车或玩游戏的人类能力。虽然人类的大脑长期以来一直是机器学习的灵感来源，但很少有人努力直接使用从工作脑中收集的数据作为机器学习算法的指导。在这里，我们展示了一个新的“神经加权”机器学习的范例，它采用fMRI测量人类大脑活动的主体观看图像，并将这些数据注入对象识别学习算法的训练过程，使其与人类更一致脑。训练后，这些神经加权分类器能够对图像进行分类，而不需要任何额外的神经数据。我们表明，我们的神经加权方法可以导致与传统的机器视觉特性一起使用时获得大的性能增益，以及已经高性能的卷积神经网络特征的显着改进。这种方法的有效性指向了一种新型的混合机器学习算法的前进道路，该算法从神经元数据中获取灵感和直接约束。
