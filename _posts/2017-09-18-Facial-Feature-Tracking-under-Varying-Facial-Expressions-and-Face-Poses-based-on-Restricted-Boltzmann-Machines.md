##### Abstract
Facial feature tracking is an active area in computer vision due to its relevance to many applications. It is a nontrivial task, since faces may have varying facial expressions, poses or occlusions. In this paper, we address this problem by proposing a face shape prior model that is constructed based on the Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBM) and their variants. Specifically, we first construct a model based on Deep Belief Networks to capture the face shape variations due to varying facial expressions for near-frontal view. To handle pose variations, the frontal face shape prior model is incorporated into a 3-way RBM model that could capture the relationship between frontal face shapes and non-frontal face shapes. Finally, we introduce methods to systematically combine the face shape prior models with image measurements of facial feature points. Experiments on benchmark databases show that with the proposed method, facial feature points can be tracked robustly and accurately even if faces have significant facial expressions and poses.

面部特征跟踪是计算机视觉中的一个活跃领域，因为它与许多应用程序相关。这是一个不平凡的任务，因为面孔可能有不同的面部表情，姿势或遮挡。在本文中，我们通过提出一个基于受限玻尔兹曼机（RBM）及其变体构建的人脸形状先验模型来解决这个问题。具体来说，我们首先构建一个基于Deep Belief Networks的模型，以捕捉由于面部表情变化而导致的面部形状变化。为了处理姿势变化，将正面人脸形状优先模型合并到三维RBM模型中，该模型可以捕捉正面人脸形状和非正面人脸形状之间的关系。最后，我们介绍一些方法，系统地将脸形先验模型与脸部特征点的图像测量相结合。在基准数据库上的实验表明，即使面部表情和姿势较大，人脸特征点也能够被鲁棒地，准确地跟踪。
