##### Abstract
Motivated by a high demand for automated inspection of civil infrastructure, this paper presents a novel design and development of a tank-like robot for structural health monitoring. Unlike most existing magnetic wheeled mobile robot designs, which is only suitable for climbing on flat steel surface, our proposed tank-like robot design uses reciprocating mechanism and roller-chains to make it capable of climbing on different structural shapes (e.g., cylinder, cube) with coated or non-coated steel surfaces. The robot can transition from one surface to the other (e.g., from flat surface to curving surface). Taking into account of several strict considerations (including tight dimension, efficient adhesion and climbing flexibility) to adapt with variety shapes of steel structures, a prototype tank-like robot incorporating multiple sensors (hall effects, sonars, inertial measurement unit and camera), has been developed. Rigorous analysis of robot kinematics, adhesion force, sliding failure and turn-over failure has been conducted to demonstrate the stability of the proposed design. Experimental results and field deployments confirm the adhesion and climbing capability of the developed robot.

由于对民用基础设施的自动化检测需求很高，本文提出了一种用于结构健康监测的罐状机器人的新颖设计和开发。与大多数现有的磁轮式移动机器人设计不同，该设计仅适用于在钢制平面上攀爬，我们提出的坦克式机器人设计采用往复机构和滚子链，使其能够在不同的结构形状（如圆柱体，立方体）与涂层或非涂层钢表面。机器人可以从一个表面转换到另一个表面（例如，从平坦表面到弯曲表面）。考虑到与各种形状的钢结构相适应的几个严格考虑因素（包括尺寸紧凑，高效粘附和爬升灵活性），一个包含多个传感器（霍尔效应，声纳，惯性测量单元和摄像头）的原型坦克机器人已经已开发。为了证明所提出的设计的稳定性，对机器人运动学，粘附力，滑动失效和翻转失败进行了严格的分析。实验结果和现场部署证实了开发的机器人的粘附和爬升能力。
