##### Abstract
Identifying and correcting grammatical errors in the text written by non-native writers has received increasing attention in recent years. Although a number of annotated corpora have been established to facilitate data-driven grammatical error detection and correction approaches, they are still limited in terms of quantity and coverage because human annotation is labor-intensive, time-consuming, and expensive. In this work, we propose to utilize unlabeled data to train neural network based grammatical error detection models. The basic idea is to cast error detection as a binary classification problem and derive positive and negative training examples from unlabeled data. We introduce an attention-based neural network to capture long-distance dependencies that influence the word being detected. Experiments show that the proposed approach significantly outperforms SVMs and convolutional networks with fixed-size context window.

识别和纠正非本土作家写的文本中的语法错误近年来受到越来越多的关注。尽管已经建立了许多注释语料库来促进数据驱动的语法错误检测和纠正方法，但是由于人工注释是劳动密集型的，耗时且昂贵的，所以它们在数量和覆盖率方面仍然有限。在这项工作中，我们建议利用未标记的数据来训练基于神经网络的语法错误检测模型。其基本思想是将错误检测作为一个二元分类问题，并从未标记的数据中导出正面和负面的训练样本。我们引入一个基于注意力的神经网络来捕捉影响被检测单词的长距离依赖性。实验表明，提出的方法明显优于具有固定尺寸上下文窗口的支持向量机和卷积网络。
