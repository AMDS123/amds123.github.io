##### Abstract
In this paper, a deep domain adaptation based method for video smoke detection is proposed to extract a powerful feature representation of smoke. Due to the smoke image samples limited in scale and diversity for deep CNN training, we systematically produced adequate synthetic smoke images with a wide variation in the smoke shape, background and lighting conditions. Considering that the appearance gap (dataset bias) between synthetic and real smoke images degrades significantly the performance of the trained model on the test set composed fully of real images, we build deep architectures based on domain adaptation to confuse the distributions of features extracted from synthetic and real smoke images. This approach expands the domain-invariant feature space for smoke image samples. With their approximate feature distribution off non-smoke images, the recognition rate of the trained model is improved significantly compared to the model trained directly on mixed dataset of synthetic and real images. Experimentally, several deep architectures with different design choices are applied to the smoke detector. The ultimate framework can get a satisfactory result on the test set. We believe that our approach is a start in the direction of utilizing deep neural networks enhanced with synthetic smoke images for video smoke detection.

本文提出了一种基于深度域自适应的视频烟雾检测方法来提取烟雾的强大特征表示。由于深度CNN训练的烟雾图像样本的尺度和多样性有限，我们系统地产生了烟雾形状，背景和光照条件变化范围广泛的合成烟雾图像。考虑到合成与真实烟雾图像之间的外观差异（数据集偏差）显着降低了训练模型在完全由真实图像组成的测试集上的性能，我们构建了基于领域自适应的深层架构，以混淆从合成提取的特征的分布和真实的烟雾图像。这种方法扩展了烟雾图像样本的域不变特征空间。利用它们近似的非烟雾图像特征分布，训练模型的识别率与直接在合成和真实图像的混合数据集上训练的模型相比得到显着改善。在实验上，几种不同设计选择的深层架构被应用于烟雾探测器。最终的框架可以在测试集上得到满意的结果。我们认为，我们的方法是利用深层神经网络增强合成烟雾图像进行视频烟雾探测的一个开始。
