##### Abstract
Although deep learning has historical roots going back decades, neither the term "deep learning" nor the approach was popular just over five years ago, when the field was reignited by papers such as Krizhevsky, Sutskever and Hinton's now classic (2012) deep network model of Imagenet. What has the field discovered in the five subsequent years? Against a background of considerable progress in areas such as speech recognition, image recognition, and game playing, and considerable enthusiasm in the popular press, I present ten concerns for deep learning, and suggest that deep learning must be supplemented by other techniques if we are to reach artificial general intelligence.

##### Abstract (translated by Google)
虽然深度学习历史根源可追溯到几十年，但就在五年前，当时Krizhevsky，Sutskever和Hinton的经典（2012）深度网络模型等论文再次引发了这一领域的“深度学习” Imagenet的。这个领域在接下来的五年中发现了什么？在语音识别，图像识别，游戏玩法等方面取得长足进步的背景下，在广大新闻界有相当的热情，我提出十个关于深度学习的问题，并建议深入学习必须辅以其他技术达到人造的一般情报。
