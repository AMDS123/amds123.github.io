##### Abstract
Preventable medical errors are estimated to be among the leading causes of injury and death in the United States. To prevent such errors, healthcare systems have implemented patient safety and incident reporting systems. These systems enable clinicians to report unsafe conditions and cases where patients have been harmed due to errors in medical care. These reports are narratives in natural language and while they provide detailed information about the situation, it is non-trivial to perform large scale analysis for identifying common causes of errors and harm to the patients. In this work, we present a method based on attentive convolutional and recurrent networks for identifying harm events in patient care and categorize the harm based on its severity level. We demonstrate that our methods can significantly improve the performance over existing methods in identifying harm in clinical care.

据估计，在美国，可预防的医疗失误是导致伤害和死亡的主要原因之一。为了防止这样的错误，医疗系统已经实施了患者安全和事件报告系统。这些系统使临床医生能够报告由于医疗服务错误而导致患者受到伤害的不安全状况和病例。这些报告是自然语言的叙述，虽然它们提供了有关情况的详细信息，但进行大规模分析以识别错误和伤害患者的常见原因并不是微不足道的。在这项工作中，我们提出了一个基于周密卷积和循环网络的方法来识别患者护理中的伤害事件，并根据其严重程度对伤害进行分类。我们证明，我们的方法可以显着提高现有方法在识别临床护理危害方面的表现。
