##### Abstract
The human behavior of evaluating other individuals with respect to their personality traits and intelligence by evaluating their faces plays a crucial role in human relations. These trait judgments might influence important social outcomes in our lives such as elections and court sentences. Previous studies have reported that human can make valid inferences for at least four personality traits. In addition, some studies have demonstrated that facial trait evaluation can be learned using machine learning methods accurately. In this work, we experimentally explore whether self-reported personality traits and intelligence can be predicted reliably from a facial image. More specifically, the prediction problem is separately cast in two parts: a classification task and a regression task. A facial structural feature is constructed from the relations among facial salient points, and an appearance feature is built by five texture descriptors. In addition, a minutia-based fingerprint feature from a fingerprint image is also explored. The classification results show that the personality traits "Rule-consciousness" and "Vigilance" can be predicted reliably, and that the traits of females can be predicted more accurately than those of male. However, the regression experiments show that it is difficult to predict scores for individual personality traits and intelligence. The residual plots and the correlation results indicate no evident linear correlation between the measured scores and the predicted scores. Both the classification and the regression results reveal that "Rule-consciousness" and "Tension" can be reliably predicted from the facial features, while "Social boldness" gets the worst prediction results. The experiments results show that it is difficult to predict intelligence from either the facial features or the fingerprint feature, a finding that is in agreement with previous studies.

##### Abstract (translated by Google)
通过评估他们的面孔评估其他人的人格特质和智力的人类行为在人际关系中起着至关重要的作用。这些特质判断可能会影响我们生活中的重要社会成果，如选举和法庭判决。以前的研究报告说人类可以对至少四种人格特征做出有效的推论。此外，一些研究已经证明，使用机器学习方法可以准确地学习面部特征评估。在这项工作中，我们通过实验探索自我报告的人格特质和智力是否可以从面部图像可靠地预测。更具体地说，预测问题分为两部分：分类任务和回归任务。从面部显着点之间的关系构造面部结构特征，并且通过五个纹理描述符来建立外观特征。另外，还探索了来自指纹图像的基于细节的指纹特征。分类结果表明，“规则意识”和“警觉性”的人格特征可以可靠地预测，女性的性状可以比男性更准确地预测。然而，回归实验显示，难以预测个体人格特质和智力的得分。残差图和相关结果表明测量得分与预测得分之间没有明显的线性相关性。分类和回归结果都表明，“规则意识”和“张力”可以从面部特征可靠地预测，而“社会大胆”是最差的预测结果。实验结果表明，从面部特征或指纹特征来预测智能是困难的，这一发现与以前的研究一致。
