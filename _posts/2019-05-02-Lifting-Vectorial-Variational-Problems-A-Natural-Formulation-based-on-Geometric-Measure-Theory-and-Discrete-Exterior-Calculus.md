##### Abstract
Numerous tasks in imaging and vision can be formulated as variational problems over vector-valued maps. We approach the relaxation and convexification of such vectorial variational problems via a lifting to the space of currents. To that end, we recall that functionals with polyconvex Lagrangians can be reparametrized as convex one-homogeneous functionals on the graph of the function. This leads to an equivalent shape optimization problem over oriented surfaces in the product space of domain and codomain. A convex formulation is then obtained by relaxing the search space from oriented surfaces to more general currents. We propose a discretization of the resulting infinite-dimensional optimization problem using Whitney forms, which also generalizes recent "sublabel-accurate" multilabeling approaches.
