##### Abstract
A drone monitoring system that integrates deep-learning-based detection and tracking modules is proposed in this work. The biggest challenge in adopting deep learning methods for drone detection is the limited amount of training drone images. To address this issue, we develop a model-based drone augmentation technique that automatically generates drone images with a bounding box label on drone's location. To track a small flying drone, we utilize the residual information between consecutive image frames. Finally, we present an integrated detection and tracking system that outperforms the performance of each individual module containing detection or tracking only. The experiments show that, even being trained on synthetic data, the proposed system performs well on real world drone images with complex background. The USC drone detection and tracking dataset with user labeled bounding boxes is available to the public.

本文提出了一种集成深度学习检测与跟踪模块的无人机监控系统。采用深度学习方法进行无人机侦测的最大挑战是有限的训练无人机图像。为了解决这个问题，我们开发了一种基于模型的无人机增强技术，可以在无人机的位置自动生成带有边框标签的无人机图像。为了追踪小型飞行无人机，我们利用连续图像帧之间的残差信息。最后，我们提出了一个综合检测和跟踪系统，超越了每个单独的模块只包含检测或跟踪的性能。实验表明，即使对合成数据进行训练，所提出的系统在具有复杂背景的真实世界无人机图像上也表现良好。 USC无人机检测和跟踪数据集以及用户标记边界框可供公众查看。
