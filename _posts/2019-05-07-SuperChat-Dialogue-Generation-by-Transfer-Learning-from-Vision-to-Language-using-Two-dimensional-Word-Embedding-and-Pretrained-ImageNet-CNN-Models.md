##### Abstract
The recent work of Super Characters method using two-dimensional word embedding achieved state-of-the-art results in text classification tasks, showcasing the promise of this new approach. This paper borrows the idea of Super Characters method and two-dimensional embedding, and proposes a method of generating conversational response for open domain dialogues. The experimental results on a public dataset shows that the proposed SuperChat method generates high quality responses. An interactive demo is ready to show at the workshop.
