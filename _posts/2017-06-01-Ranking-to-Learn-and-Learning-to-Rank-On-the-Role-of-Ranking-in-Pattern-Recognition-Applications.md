##### Abstract
The last decade has seen a revolution in the theory and application of machine learning and pattern recognition. Through these advancements, variable ranking has emerged as an active and growing research area and it is now beginning to be applied to many new problems. The rationale behind this fact is that many pattern recognition problems are by nature ranking problems. The main objective of a ranking algorithm is to sort objects according to some criteria, so that, the most relevant items will appear early in the produced result list. Ranking methods can be analyzed from two different methodological perspectives: ranking to learn and learning to rank. The former aims at studying methods and techniques to sort objects for improving the accuracy of a machine learning model. Enhancing a model performance can be challenging at times. For example, in pattern classification tasks, different data representations can complicate and hide the different explanatory factors of variation behind the data. In particular, hand-crafted features contain many cues that are either redundant or irrelevant, which turn out to reduce the overall accuracy of the classifier. In such a case feature selection is used, that, by producing ranked lists of features, helps to filter out the unwanted information. Moreover, in real-time systems (e.g., visual trackers) ranking approaches are used as optimization procedures which improve the robustness of the system that deals with the high variability of the image streams that change over time. The other way around, learning to rank is necessary in the construction of ranking models for information retrieval, biometric authentication, re-identification, and recommender systems. In this context, the ranking model's purpose is to sort objects according to their degrees of relevance, importance, or preference as defined in the specific application.

近十年来，机器学习和模式识别的理论和应用发生了一场革命。通过这些进步，变量排名已经成为一个活跃和不断发展的研究领域，现在已经开始应用于许多新问题。这个事实背后的基本原理是，许多模式识别问题本质上是排序问题。排序算法的主要目标是根据一些标准对对象进行排序，因此，最相关的项目将会出现在产生的结果列表的早期。排名方法可以从两种不同的方法论角度进行分析：排名学习和学习排名。前者旨在研究分类对象的方法和技术，以提高机器学习模型的准确性。有时候提高模型性能可能是一个挑战。例如，在模式分类任务中，不同的数据表示会使数据背后不同的变化说明因素复杂化和隐藏起来。特别是手工制作的特征包含很多或多或少的提示，从而降低了分类器的整体准确性。在这种情况下，使用特征选择，即通过产生排列的特征列表，有助于过滤不需要的信息。而且，在实时系统（例如，视觉追踪器）中，排名方法被用作优化程序，其改善了处理随时间变化的图像流的高度可变性的系统的健壮性。反过来，学习排名对于建立信息检索，生物认证，重新识别和推荐系统的排名模型是必要的。在这种情况下，排名模型的目的是根据具体应用中定义的相关程度，重要性或偏好对对象进行排序。
