##### Abstract
We propose a method to maintain high resource in a networked heterogeneous multi-robot system to resource failures. In our model, resources such as and computation are available on robots. The robots engaged in a joint task using these pooled resources. In our model, a resource on a particular robot becomes unavailable e.g., a sensor ceases to function due to a failure), the system reconfigures so that the robot continues to have to this resource by communicating with other robots. Specifically, we consider the problem of selecting edges to be in the system's communication graph after a resource has occurred. We define a metric that allows us to characterize the quality of the resource distribution in the represented by the communication graph. Upon a resource becoming unavailable due to failure, we reconfigure network so that the resource distribution is brought as to the ideal resource distribution as possible without a big change in the communication cost. Our approach uses integer semi-definite programming to achieve this goal. We also provide a simulated annealing method to compute a formation that satisfies the inter-robot distances imposed by the topology, along with other constraints. Our method can compute a communication topology, spatial formation, and formation change motion planning in a few seconds. We validate our method in simulation and real-robot experiments with a team of seven quadrotors.
