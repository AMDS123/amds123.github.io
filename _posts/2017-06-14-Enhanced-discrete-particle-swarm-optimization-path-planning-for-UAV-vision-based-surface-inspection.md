##### Abstract
In built infrastructure monitoring, an efficient path planning algorithm is essential for robotic inspection of large surfaces using computer vision. In this work, we first formulate the inspection path planning problem as an extended travelling salesman problem (TSP) in which both the coverage and obstacle avoidance were taken into account. An enhanced discrete particle swarm optimization (DPSO) algorithm is then proposed to solve the TSP, with performance improvement by using deterministic initialization, random mutation, and edge exchange. Finally, we take advantage of parallel computing to implement the DPSO in a GPU-based framework so that the computation time can be significantly reduced while keeping the hardware requirement unchanged. To show the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm, experimental results are included for datasets obtained from UAV inspection of an office building and a bridge.

在构建的基础设施监控中，高效的路径规划算法对于使用计算机视觉的大型表面的机器人检测至关重要。在这项工作中，我们首先将检查路径规划问题作为扩展的旅行商问题（TSP），其中考虑了覆盖范围和避障。提出了一种改进的离散粒子群优化算法（DPSO）来解决TSP问题，通过确定性初始化，随机变异和边缘交换来提高性能。最后，我们利用并行计算在基于GPU的框架中实现DPSO，从而在保持硬件需求不变的情况下大大减少计算时间。为了显示所提出的算法的有效性，将实验结果包括在从办公大楼和桥梁的无人机检查获得的数据集中。
