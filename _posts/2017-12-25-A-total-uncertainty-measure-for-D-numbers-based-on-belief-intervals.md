##### Abstract
As a generalization of Dempster-Shafer theory, the theory of D numbers is a new theoretical framework for uncertainty reasoning. Measuring the uncertainty of knowledge or information represented by D numbers is an unsolved issue in that theory. In this paper, inspired by distance based uncertainty measures for Dempster-Shafer theory, a total uncertainty measure for a D number is proposed based on its belief intervals. The proposed total uncertainty measure can simultaneously capture the discord, and non-specificity, and non-exclusiveness involved in D numbers. And some basic properties of this total uncertainty measure, including range, monotonicity, generalized set consistency, are also presented.

作为Dempster-Shafer理论的推广，D数理论是一种新的不确定性推理理论框架。衡量由D数表示的知识或信息的不确定性是该理论中尚未解决的问题。本文在Dempster-Shafer理论基于距离的不确定性度量的基础上，提出了一个基于信念区间的D数的不确定度度量。所提出的总体不确定性度量可以同时捕捉D个数中所包含的不和谐性，非特异性和非排他性。并给出了总体不确定性度量的一些基本性质，包括范围，单调性，广义集合一致性等。
