##### Abstract
Multimodal medical image fusion helps to increase efficiency in medical diagnosis. This paper presents multimodal medical image fusion by selecting relevant features using Principle Component Analysis (PCA) and Particle Swarm Optimization techniques (PSO). DTCWT is used for decomposition of the images into low and high frequency coefficients. Fusion rules such as combination of minimum, maximum and simple averaging are applied to approximate and detailed coefficients. The fused image is reconstructed by inverse DTCWT. Performance metrics are evaluated and it shows that DTCWT-PCA performs better than DTCWT-PSO in terms of Structural Similarity Index Measure (SSIM) and Cross Correlation (CC). Computation time and feature vector size is reduced in DTCWT-PCA compared to DTCWT-PSO for feature selection which proves robustness and storage capacity.

多模医学图像融合有助于提高医疗诊断的效率。本文采用主成分分析（PCA）和粒子群优化（PSO）技术，选择相关特征，提出多模态医学图像融合。 DTCWT用于将图像分解为低频和高频系数。融合规则，如最小值，最大值和简单平均的组合应用于近似和详细的系数。融合后的图像通过逆DTCWT重建。对性能指标进行评估，结果表明DTCWT-PCA在结构相似性指数测量（SSIM）和交叉相关性（CC）方面的表现优于DTCWT-PSO。与DTCWT-PSO相比，DTCWT-PCA的计算时间和特征向量大小减少，用于证明鲁棒性和存储容量的特征选择。
