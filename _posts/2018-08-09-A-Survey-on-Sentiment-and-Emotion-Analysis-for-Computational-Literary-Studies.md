##### Abstract
Emotions have often been a crucial part of compelling narratives: literature tells about people with goals, desires, passions, and intentions. In the past, classical literary studies usually scrutinized the affective dimension of literature within the framework of hermeneutics. However, with emergence of the research field known as Digital Humanities (DH) some studies of emotions in literary context have taken a computational turn. Given the fact that DH is still being formed as a science, this direction of research can be rendered relatively new. At the same time, the research in sentiment analysis started in computational linguistic almost two decades ago and is nowadays an established field that has dedicated workshops and tracks in the main computational linguistics conferences. This leads us to the question of what are the commonalities and discrepancies between sentiment analysis research in computational linguistics and digital humanities? In this survey, we offer an overview of the existing body of research on sentiment and emotion analysis as applied to literature. We precede the main part of the survey with a short introduction to natural language processing and machine learning, psychological models of emotions, and provide an overview of existing approaches to sentiment and emotion analysis in computational linguistics. The papers presented in this survey are either coming directly from DH or computational linguistics venues and are limited to sentiment and emotion analysis as applied to literary text.

##### Abstract (translated by Google)
情绪通常是引人入胜的叙事的重要组成部分：文学讲述了有目标，欲望，激情和意图的人。在过去，古典文学研究通常在诠释学的框架内仔细审视文学的情感维度。然而，随着被称为数字人文学科（DH）的研究领域的出现，一些关于文学语境中情绪的研究已经进行了计算。鉴于DH仍然是作为一门科学而形成的，这个研究方向可以变得相对较新。与此同时，情感分析研究几乎在二十年前开始于计算语言学，现在已成为一个在主要计算语言学会议上有专门研讨会和轨道的既定领域。这引出了一个问题：计算语言学中的情感分析研究与数字人文学科之间的共性和差异是什么？在本次调查中，我们概述了应用于文献的现有情绪和情绪分析研究。我们在调查的主要部分之前简要介绍了自然语言处理和机器学习，情绪的心理模型，并提供了计算语言学中情感和情感分析的现有方法的概述。本调查中提供的论文或者直接来自DH或计算语言学场所，仅限于应用于文学文本的情感和情感分析。
