##### Abstract
Automated pavement crack detection is a challenging task that has been researched for decades due to the complicated pavement conditions in real world. In this paper, a supervised method based on deep learning is proposed, which has the capability of dealing with different pavement conditions. Specifically, a convolutional neural network (CNN) is used to learn the structure of the cracks from raw images, without any preprocessing. Small patches are extracted from crack images as inputs to generate a large training database, a CNN is trained and crack detection is modeled as a multi-label classification problem. Typically, crack pixels are much fewer than non-crack pixels. To deal with the problem with severely imbalanced data, a strategy with modifying the ratio of positive to negative samples is proposed. The method is tested on two public databases and compared with five existing methods. Experimental results show that it outperforms the other methods.

自动化路面裂缝检测是一项具有挑战性的任务，由于现实世界中复杂的路面条件而被研究了数十年。本文提出了一种基于深度学习的监督方法，该方法具有处理不同路面状况的能力。具体而言，卷积神经网络（CNN）用于从原始图像中学习裂纹的结构，而不需要任何预处理。从裂缝图像中提取小块作为输入，生成大型训练数据库，训练CNN并将裂缝检测建模为多标签分类问题。通常，裂缝像素比非裂缝像素少得多。针对数据严重不平衡的问题，提出了改正正负样本比例的策略。该方法在两个公共数据库上进行测试，并与现有的五种方法进行比较实验结果表明，它优于其他方法。
