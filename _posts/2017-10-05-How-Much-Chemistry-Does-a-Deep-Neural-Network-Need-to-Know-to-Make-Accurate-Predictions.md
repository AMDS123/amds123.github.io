##### Abstract
In the last few years, we have seen the rise of deep learning applications in a broad range of chemistry research problems. Recently, we reported on the development of Chemception, a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture for general-purpose small molecule property prediction. In this work, we investigate the effects of systematically removing and adding basic chemical information to the image channels of the 2D images used to train Chemception. By augmenting images with only 3 additional basic chemical information, we demonstrate that Chemception now outperforms contemporary deep learning models trained on more sophisticated chemical representations (molecular fingerprints) for the prediction of toxicity, activity, and solvation free energy, as well as physics-based free energy simulation methods. Thus, our work demonstrates that a firm grasp of first-principles chemical knowledge is not a pre-requisite for deep learning models to accurately predict chemical properties. Lastly, by altering the chemical information content in the images, and examining the resulting performance of Chemception, we also identify two different learning patterns in predicting toxicity/activity as compared to solvation free energy, and these patterns suggest that Chemception is learning about its tasks in the manner that is consistent with established knowledge.

在过去的几年里，我们看到了深度学习在广泛的化学研究问题中的应用。最近，我们报道了Chemception（一种用于通用小分子属性预测的深度卷积神经网络（CNN）体系结构）的发展。在这项工作中，我们调查系统去除和添加基本化学信息的图像渠道用于培训化学的2D图像的影响。通过增加图像只有3个额外的基本化学信息，我们表明，化学现在胜过当代深刻的学习模式训练更复杂的化学表示（分子指纹）预测的毒性，活动，溶剂化自由能，以及物理为基础自由能模拟方法。因此，我们的工作表明，对第一性原理化学知识的牢固掌握并不是精确预测化学性质的深度学习模型的先决条件。最后，通过改变图像中的化学信息含量，检查化学成分的性能，我们还确定了两种不同的学习模式来预测毒性/活性与溶剂化自由能相比，这些模式表明Chemception正在学习其任务以符合既定知识的方式。
