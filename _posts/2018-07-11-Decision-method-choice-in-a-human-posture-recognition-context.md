##### Abstract
Human posture recognition provides a dynamic field that has produced many methods. Using fuzzy subsets based data fusion methods to aggregate the results given by different types of recognition processes is a convenient way to improve recognition methods. Nevertheless, choosing a defuzzification method to imple-ment the decision is a crucial point of this approach. The goal of this paper is to present an approach where the choice of the defuzzification method is driven by the constraints of the final data user, which are expressed as limitations on indica-tors like confidence or accuracy. A practical experimentation illustrating this ap-proach is presented: from a depth camera sensor, human posture is interpreted and the defuzzification method is selected in accordance with the constraints of the final information consumer. The paper illustrates the interest of the approach in a context of postures based human robot communication.

人体姿势识别提供了产生许多方法的动态场。使用基于模糊子集的数据融合方法来聚合由不同类型的识别过程给出的结果是改进识别方法的便利方式。然而，选择一种去模糊化方法来实施决策是这种方法的关键点。本文的目的是提出一种方法，即去模糊化方法的选择是由最终数据用户的约束驱动的，这些限制表示为对信任度或准确性等指标的限制。提供了说明该方法的实际实验：从深度相机传感器，解释人体姿势并根据最终信息消费者的约束选择去模糊化方法。本文阐述了该方法在基于姿势的人体机器人通信环境中的兴趣。
