##### Abstract
We consider decision problems under uncertainty where the options available to a decision maker and the resulting outcome are related through a causal mechanism which is unknown to the decision maker. We ask how a decision maker can learn about this causal mechanism through sequential decision making as well as using current causal knowledge inside each round in order to make better choices had she not considered causal knowledge and propose a decision making procedure in which an agent holds \textit{beliefs} about her environment which are used to make a choice and are updated using the observed outcome. As proof of concept, we present an implementation of this causal decision making model and apply it in a simple scenario. We show that the model achieves a performance similar to the classic Q-learning while it also acquires a causal model of the environment.

我们认为决策问题存在不确定性，决策者可以选择的选项以及由此产生的结果是通过决策者不知道的因果机制来确定的。我们询问决策者如何通过顺序决策来学习这种因果机制，以及在每一轮内部使用当前的因果知识，以便在不考虑因果知识的情况下做出更好的选择，并提出一个代理人持有的决策程序textit {beliefs}关于她的环境，用于做出选择并使用观察到的结果进行更新。作为概念证明，我们提出了这种因果决策模型的实现，并将其应用于一个简单的场景中。我们证明该模型实现了与经典Q学习类似的性能，同时它还获得了环境的因果模型。
