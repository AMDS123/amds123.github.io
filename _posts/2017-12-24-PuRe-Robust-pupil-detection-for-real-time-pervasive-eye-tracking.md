##### Abstract
Real-time, accurate, and robust pupil detection is an essential prerequisite to enable pervasive eye-tracking and its applications -- e.g., gaze-based human computer interaction, health monitoring, foveated rendering, and advanced driver assistance. However, automated pupil detection has proved to be an intricate task in real-world scenarios due to a large mixture of challenges such as quickly changing illumination and occlusions. In this paper, we introduce the Pupil Reconstructor PuRe, a method for pupil detection in pervasive scenarios based on a novel edge segment selection and conditional segment combination schemes; the method also includes a confidence measure for the detected pupil. The proposed method was evaluated on over 316,000 images acquired with four distinct head-mounted eye tracking devices. Results show a pupil detection rate improvement of over 10 percentage points w.r.t. state-of-the-art algorithms in the two most challenging data sets (6.46 for all data sets), further pushing the envelope for pupil detection. Moreover, we advance the evaluation protocol of pupil detection algorithms by also considering eye images in which pupils are not present. In this aspect, PuRe improved precision and specificity w.r.t. state-of-the-art algorithms by 25.05 and 10.94 percentage points, respectively, demonstrating the meaningfulness of PuRe's confidence measure. PuRe operates in real-time for modern eye trackers (at 120 fps).

实时，准确，稳健的瞳孔检测是为了使普遍的眼动跟踪及其应用的必要先决条件 - 例如，基于注视的人机交互，健康监测，视网膜中央凹渲染和先进的驾驶辅助。然而，由于诸如快速变化的照明和遮挡等挑战的大量混合，自动瞳孔检测在现实世界中被证明是复杂的任务。本文介绍了一种基于边缘段选择和条件段组合方案的瞳孔重建算法PuRe，该方法还包括检测到的瞳孔的置信度量度。对所提出的方法进行了评估，超过316,000图像采集与四个不同的头戴式眼睛跟踪设备。结果显示，瞳孔检出率提高了10个百分点以上。在两个最具挑战性的数据集（所有数据集为6.46）中最先进的算法，进一步推动了瞳孔检测的信封。此外，我们还通过考虑瞳孔不存在的眼睛图像来推进瞳孔检测算法的评估协议。在这方面，PuRe提高了精确度和特异性w.r.t.最先进的算法分别达到25.05和10.94个百分点，证明了PuRe置信度的意义。 PuRe实时操作现代眼动仪（120 fps）。
