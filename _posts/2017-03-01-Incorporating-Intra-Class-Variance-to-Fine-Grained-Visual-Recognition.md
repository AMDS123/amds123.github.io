##### Abstract
Fine-grained visual recognition aims to capture discriminative characteristics amongst visually similar categories. The state-of-the-art research work has significantly improved the fine-grained recognition performance by deep metric learning using triplet network. However, the impact of intra-category variance on the performance of recognition and robust feature representation has not been well studied. In this paper, we propose to leverage intra-class variance in metric learning of triplet network to improve the performance of fine-grained recognition. Through partitioning training images within each category into a few groups, we form the triplet samples across different categories as well as different groups, which is called Group Sensitive TRiplet Sampling (GS-TRS). Accordingly, the triplet loss function is strengthened by incorporating intra-class variance with GS-TRS, which may contribute to the optimization objective of triplet network. Extensive experiments over benchmark datasets CompCar and VehicleID show that the proposed GS-TRS has significantly outperformed state-of-the-art approaches in both classification and retrieval tasks.

细粒度的视觉识别旨在捕捉视觉上相似类别中的区分特征。最先进的研究工作通过使用三重网络的深度度量学习显着提高了细粒度识别性能。然而，类内方差对识别性能和鲁棒特征表示的影响还没有得到很好的研究。在本文中，我们建议利用三重网络的度量学习中的类内方差来提高细粒度识别的性能。通过将每个类别中的训练图像划分为几个组，我们形成跨越不同类别以及不同组的三重样本，称为群敏TRIplet Sampling（GS-TRS）。因此，通过将类内方差与GS-TRS相结合可以增强三元组损失函数，这可能有助于三元网络的优化目标。在基准数据集CompCar和VehicleID上进行的大量实验表明，所提出的GS-TRS在分类和检索任务中的性能都优于现有技术。
