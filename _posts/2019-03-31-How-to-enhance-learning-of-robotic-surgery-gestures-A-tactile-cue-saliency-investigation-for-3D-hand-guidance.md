##### Abstract
The current generation of surgeons requires extensive training in teleoperation to develop specific dexterous skills, which are independent of medical knowledge. Training curricula progress from manipulation tasks to simulated surgical tasks but are limited in time. To tackle this, we propose to integrate surgical robotic training together with Haptic Feedback (HF) to improve skill acquisition. This paper present the initial but promising results of our haptic device designed to support in the training of surgical gestures. Our ongoing work is related to integrate the HF in the RAVEN II platform.
