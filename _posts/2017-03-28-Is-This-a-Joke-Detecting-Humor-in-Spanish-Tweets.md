##### Abstract
While humor has been historically studied from a psychological, cognitive and linguistic standpoint, its study from a computational perspective is an area yet to be explored in Computational Linguistics. There exist some previous works, but a characterization of humor that allows its automatic recognition and generation is far from being specified. In this work we build a crowdsourced corpus of labeled tweets, annotated according to its humor value, letting the annotators subjectively decide which are humorous. A humor classifier for Spanish tweets is assembled based on supervised learning, reaching a precision of 84% and a recall of 69%.

虽然从心理学，认知学和语言学角度对幽默进行了历史研究，但是从计算的角度来看，幽默是计算语言学尚待探索的领域。有一些以前的作品，但幽默的表征，使其自动识别和生成远没有指定。在这项工作中，我们建立了一个众包的标签推文，根据它的幽默价值注释，让注释者主观地决定哪些是幽默的。西班牙语推特的幽默分类器基于监督式学习进行组装，达到84％的精确度和69％的召回率。
