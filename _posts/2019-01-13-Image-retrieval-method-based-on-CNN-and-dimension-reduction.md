##### Abstract
An image retrieval method based on convolution neural network and dimension reduction is proposed in this paper. Convolution neural network is used to extract high-level features of images, and to solve the problem that the extracted feature dimensions are too high and have strong correlation, multilinear principal component analysis is used to reduce the dimension of features. The features after dimension reduction are binary hash coded for fast image retrieval. Experiments show that the method proposed in this paper has better retrieval effect than the retrieval method based on principal component analysis on the e-commerce image datasets.
