##### Abstract
The Hard Problem of consciousness has been dismissed as an illusion. By showing that computers are capable of experiencing, we show that they are at least rudimentarily conscious with potential to eventually reach superconsciousness. The main contribution of the paper is a test for confirming certain subjective experiences in a tested agent. We follow with analysis of benefits and problems with conscious machines and implications of such capability on future of computing, machine rights and artificial intelligence safety.

意识的艰难问题被视为一种错觉。通过显示计算机能够体验，我们表明，他们至少是基本意识到有潜力最终达到超意识。这篇论文的主要贡献是为了确认受试代理人的某些主观经验。我们随后分析有意识的机器的益处和问题，以及这种能力对未来计算，机器权利和人工智能安全的影响。
