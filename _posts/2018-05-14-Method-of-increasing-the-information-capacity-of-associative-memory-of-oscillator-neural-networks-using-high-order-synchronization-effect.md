##### Abstract
Computational modelling of two- and three-oscillator schemes with thermally coupled $VO_2$-switches is used to demonstrate a novel method of pattern storage and recognition in an impulse oscillator neural network (ONN) based on the high-order synchronization effect. The method ensures high information capacity of associative memory, i.e. a large number of synchronous states $N_s$. Each state in the system is characterized by the synchronization order determined as the ratio of harmonics number at the common synchronization frequency. The modelling demonstrates attainment of $N_s$ of several orders both for a three-oscillator scheme $N_s$~650 and for a two-oscillator scheme $N_s$~260. A number of regularities are obtained, in particular, an optimal strength of oscillator coupling is revealed when $N_s$ has a maximum. A general tendency toward information capacity decrease is shown when the coupling strength and switch inner noise amplitude increase. An algorithm of pattern storage and test vector recognition is suggested. It is also shown that the coordinate number in each vector should be one less than the switch number to reduce recognition ambiguity. The demonstrated method of associative memory realization is a general one and it may be applied in ONNs with various mechanisms and oscillator coupling topology.
