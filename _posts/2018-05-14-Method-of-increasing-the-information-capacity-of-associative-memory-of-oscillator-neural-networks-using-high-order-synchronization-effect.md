##### Abstract
Computational modelling of two- and three-oscillator schemes with thermally coupled $VO_2$-switches is used to demonstrate a novel method of pattern storage and recognition in an impulse oscillator neural network (ONN) based on the high-order synchronization effect. The method ensures high information capacity of associative memory, i.e. a large number of synchronous states $N_s$. Each state in the system is characterized by the synchronization order determined as the ratio of harmonics number at the common synchronization frequency. The modelling demonstrates attainment of $N_s$ of several orders both for a three-oscillator scheme $N_s$~650 and for a two-oscillator scheme $N_s$~260. A number of regularities are obtained, in particular, an optimal strength of oscillator coupling is revealed when $N_s$ has a maximum. A general tendency toward information capacity decrease is shown when the coupling strength and switch inner noise amplitude increase. An algorithm of pattern storage and test vector recognition is suggested. It is also shown that the coordinate number in each vector should be one less than the switch number to reduce recognition ambiguity. The demonstrated method of associative memory realization is a general one and it may be applied in ONNs with various mechanisms and oscillator coupling topology.

使用热耦合$ VO_2 $开关的两振子和三振子方案的计算建模被用于演示基于高阶同步效应的脉冲振荡器神经网络（ONN）中的模式存储和识别的新方法。该方法确保了关联存储器的高信息容量，即大量的同步状态$ N_s $。系统中的每个状态都由同步顺序来表征，该同步顺序被确定为公共同步频率处谐波数量的比率。建模表明，对于三振荡器方案$ N_s $〜650和对于双振荡器方案$ N_s $〜260，几个订单的$ N_s $达到。获得许多规律性，特别是当$ N_s $具有最大值时，揭示振荡器耦合的最佳强度。当耦合强度和开关内部噪声幅度增加时，会显示信息容量下降的总趋势。提出了一种模式存储和测试向量识别算法。还显示每个矢量中的坐标数应该比开关数少一个以减少识别模糊度。已经证明的联想记忆实现方法是一个普遍的方法，它可以用于具有各种机制和振荡器耦合拓扑的ONN。
