##### Abstract
To optimize fruit production, a portion of the flowers and fruitlets of apple trees must be removed early in the growing season. The proportion to be removed is determined by the bloom intensity, i.e., the number of flowers present in the orchard. Several automated computer vision systems have been proposed to estimate bloom intensity, but their overall performance is still far from satisfactory even in relatively controlled environments. With the goal of devising a technique for flower identification which is robust to clutter and to changes in illumination, this paper presents a method in which a pre-trained convolutional neural network is fine-tuned to become specially sensitive to flowers. Experimental results on a challenging dataset demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms three approaches that represent the state of the art in flower detection, with recall and precision rates higher than $90\%$. Moreover, a performance assessment on three additional datasets previously unseen by the network, which consist of different flower species and were acquired under different conditions, reveals that the proposed method highly surpasses baseline approaches in terms of generalization capability.

为了优化水果生产，必须在生长季节的早期去除苹果树的一部分花和小果。要除去的比例由绽放强度，即果园中存在的花的数量决定。已经提出了几种自动计算机视觉系统来估计起霜强度，但是即使在相对受控的环境中它们的整体性能仍然远远不能令人满意。为了设计一种对杂乱和光照变化具有鲁棒性的花识别技术，本文提出了一种方法，其中预先训练的卷积神经网络被微调以变得对花特别敏感。在具有挑战性的数据集上的实验结果表明，我们的方法明显优于代表花检测技术水平的三种方法，其召回率和准确率均高于90美元/％。此外，对网络以前未见过的三个额外数据集进行了性能评估，这些数据集由不同的花种组成，并且在不同的条件下获得，表明所提出的方法在泛化能力方面高度超过基线方法。
