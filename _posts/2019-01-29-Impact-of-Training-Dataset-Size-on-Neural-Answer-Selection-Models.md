##### Abstract
It is held as a truism that deep neural networks require large datasets to train effective models. However, large datasets, especially with high-quality labels, can be expensive to obtain. This study sets out to investigate (i) how large a dataset must be to train well-performing models, and (ii) what impact can be shown from fractional changes to the dataset size. A practical method to investigate these questions is to train a collection of deep neural answer selection models using fractional subsets of varying sizes of an initial dataset. We observe that dataset size has a conspicuous lack of effect on the training of some of these models, bringing the underlying algorithms into question.
