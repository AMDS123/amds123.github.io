##### Abstract
Multi-view datasets are frequently encountered in learning tasks, such as web data mining and multimedia information analysis. Given a multi-view dataset, traditional learning algorithms usually decompose it into several single-view datasets, from each of which a single-view model is learned. In contrast, a multi-view learning algorithm can achieve better performance by cooperative learning on the multi-view data. However, existing multi-view approaches mainly focus on the views that are visible and ignore the hidden information behind the visible views, which usually contains some intrinsic information of the multi-view data, or vice versa. To address this problem, this paper proposes a multi-view fuzzy logic system, which utilizes both the hidden information shared by the multiple visible views and the information of each visible view. Extensive experiments were conducted to validate its effectiveness.

在学习任务中经常遇到多视图数据集，例如Web数据挖掘和多媒体信息分析。给定多视图数据集，传统的学习算法通常将其分解为几个单视图数据集，从中学习单视图模型。相反，多视图学习算法可以通过对多视图数据的协作学习来实现更好的性能。然而，现有的多视图方法主要关注可见的视图并忽略可见视图背后的隐藏信息，其通常包含多视图数据的一些内在信息，反之亦然。为了解决这个问题，本文提出了一种多视图模糊逻辑系统，它利用了多个可见视图共享的隐藏信息和每个可见视图的信息。进行了广泛的实验以验证其有效性。
