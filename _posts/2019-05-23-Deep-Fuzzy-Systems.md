##### Abstract
An investigation of deep fuzzy systems is presented in this paper. A deep fuzzy system is represented by recursive fuzzy systems from an input terminal to output terminal. Recursive fuzzy systems are sequences of fuzzy grade memberships obtained using fuzzy transmition functions and recursive calls to fuzzy systems. A recursive fuzzy system which calls a fuzzy system n times includes fuzzy chains to evaluate the final grade membership of this recursive system. A connection matrix which includes recursive calls are used to represent recursive fuzzy systems.
