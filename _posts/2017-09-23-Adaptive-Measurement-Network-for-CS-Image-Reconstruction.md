##### Abstract
Conventional compressive sensing (CS) reconstruction is very slow for its characteristic of solving an optimization problem. Convolu- tional neural network can realize fast processing while achieving compa- rable results. While CS image recovery with high quality not only de- pends on good reconstruction algorithms, but also good measurements. In this paper, we propose an adaptive measurement network in which measurement is obtained by learning. The new network consists of a fully-connected layer and ReconNet. The fully-connected layer which has low-dimension output acts as measurement. We train the fully-connected layer and ReconNet simultaneously and obtain adaptive measurement. Because the adaptive measurement fits dataset better, in contrast with random Gaussian measurement matrix, under the same measuremen- t rate, it can extract the information of scene more efficiently and get better reconstruction results. Experiments show that the new network outperforms the original one.

传统的压缩感知（CS）重建由于其解决优化问题的特性而非常缓慢。卷积神经网络可以实现快速处理，同时达到可比较的结果。虽然高品质的CS图像恢复不仅取决于良好的重建算法，而且还有很好的测量。在本文中，我们提出一个自适应测量网络，通过学习获得测量结果。新网络由完全连接的层和ReconNet组成。具有低维度输出的全连接层作为测量。我们同时训练全连接层和ReconNet并获得自适应测量。由于自适应测量更适合数据集，与随机高斯测量矩阵相比，在相同的测量速率下，可以更有效地提取场景信息，获得更好的重建结果。实验表明，新网络胜过原来的网络。
