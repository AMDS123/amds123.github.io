##### Abstract
The human face constantly conveys information, both consciously and subconsciously. However, as basic as it is for humans to visually interpret this information, it is quite a big challenge for machines. Conventional semantic facial feature recognition and analysis techniques are already in use and are based on physiological heuristics, but they suffer from lack of robustness and high computation time. This thesis aims to explore ways for machines to learn to interpret semantic information available in faces in an automated manner without requiring manual design of feature detectors, using the approach of Deep Learning. This thesis provides a study of the effects of various factors and hyper-parameters of deep neural networks in the process of determining an optimal network configuration for the task of semantic facial feature recognition. This thesis explores the effectiveness of the system to recognize the various semantic features (like emotions, age, gender, ethnicity etc.) present in faces. Furthermore, the relation between the effect of high-level concepts on low level features is explored through an analysis of the similarities in low-level descriptors of different semantic features. This thesis also demonstrates a novel idea of using a deep network to generate 3-D Active Appearance Models of faces from real-world 2-D images.

##### Abstract (translated by Google)
人脸不时地自觉地，潜意识地传达着信息。然而，和人类一样，这个信息在视觉上是可以理解的，这对于机器来说是一个相当大的挑战。传统的语义人脸特征识别和分析技术已经在使用，基于生理学的启发式算法，但缺乏鲁棒性和高计算时间。本文旨在探索机器学习如何用自动化的方式解释人脸中可用的语义信息，而不需要人工设计特征检测器，采用深度学习的方法。本文研究了深度神经网络各种因素和超参数在确定语义人脸特征识别任务的最优网络配置过程中的作用。本文探讨了系统识别面孔中各种语义特征（如情绪，年龄，性别，种族等）的有效性。此外，通过分析不同语义特征的低层次描述符的相似性，探讨高层次概念对低层特征的影响。本文还展示了一种利用深度网络从实际二维图像生成人脸三维活动外观模型的新思路。有关这项工作的更详细报告，请参阅[arXiv：1512.00743v1]。
