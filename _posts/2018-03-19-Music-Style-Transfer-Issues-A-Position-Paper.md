##### Abstract
Led by the success of neural style transfer on visual arts, there has been a rising trend very recently in the effort of music style transfer. However, "music style" is not yet a well-defined concept from a scientific point of view. The difficulty lies in the intrinsic multi-level and multi-modal character of music representation (which is very different from image representation). As a result, depending on their interpretation of "music style", current studies under the category of "music style transfer", are actually solving completely different problems that belong to a variety of sub-fields of Computer Music. Also, a vanilla end-to-end approach, which aims at dealing with all levels of music representation at once by directly adopting the method of image style transfer, leads to poor results. Thus, we see a vital necessity to re-define music style transfer more precisely and scientifically based on the uniqueness of music representation, as well as to connect different aspects of music style transfer with existing well-established sub-fields of computer music studies. Otherwise, an accumulated upcoming literature (all named after music style transfer) will lead to a great confusion of the underlying problems as well as negligence of the treasures in computer music before the age of deep learning. In addition, we discuss the current limitations of music style modeling and its future directions by drawing spirit from some deep generative models, especially the ones using unsupervised learning and disentanglement techniques.

在视觉艺术的神经风格转换成功的带领下，最近在音乐风格转换方面呈现上升趋势。然而，从科学的角度来看，“音乐风格”还不是一个明确的概念。困难在于音乐表现的固有的多层次和多模式特征（这与图像表示有很大不同）。因此，根据对“音乐风格”的解释，目前在“音乐风格转换”类别下的研究实际上解决了属于计算机音乐各种子领域的完全不同的问题。此外，一种旨在通过直接采用图像风格转移方法来同时处理所有级别音乐表示的香草端对端方法导致较差的结果。因此，我们看到基于音乐表现的独特性，更加精确和科学地重新定义音乐风格转换的必要性，以及将音乐风格转换的不同方面与现有的完善的计算机音乐研究子领域联系起来。否则，即将到来的文学作品（所有以音乐风格转换命名的文学作品）都会导致深层次的问题以及在深度学习之前对电脑音乐中的宝藏的疏忽大惑不解。此外，我们通过从一些深层生成模型中吸取精神，尤其是使用无监督学习和解缠技术的模型，来讨论当前音乐风格建模及其未来发展方向的局限性。
