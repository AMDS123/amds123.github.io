##### Abstract
The task of action recognition or action detection involves analyzing videos and determining what action or motion is being performed. The primary subject of these videos are predominantly humans performing some action. However, this requirement can be relaxed to generalize over other subjects such as animals or robots. The applications can range from anywhere between human-computer inter-action to automated video editing proposals. When we consider spatiotemporal action recognition, we deal with action localization. This task not only involves determining what action is being performed but also when and where itis being performed in said video. This paper aims to survey the plethora of approaches and algorithms attempted to solve this task, give a comprehensive comparison between them, explore various datasets available for the problem, and determine the most promising approaches.
