##### Abstract
Face frontalization is the process of synthesizing frontal facing views of faces given its angled poses. We implement a generative adversarial network (GAN) with spherical linear interpolation (Slerp) for frontalization of unconstrained facial images. Our special focus is intended towards the generation of approximate frontal faces of the side posed images captured from surveillance cameras. Specifically, the present work is a comprehensive study on the implementation of an auto-encoder based Boundary Equilibrium GAN (BEGAN) to generate frontal faces using an interpolation of a side view face and its mirrored view. To increase the quality of the interpolated output we implement a BEGAN with Slerp. This approach could produce a promising output along with a faster and more stable training for the model. The BEGAN model additionally has a balanced generator-discriminator combination, which prevents mode collapse along with a global convergence measure. It is expected that such an approximate face generation model would be able to replace face composites used in surveillance and crime detection.
