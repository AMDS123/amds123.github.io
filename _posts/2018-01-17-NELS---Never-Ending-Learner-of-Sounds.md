##### Abstract
Sounds are essential to how humans perceive and interact with the world and are captured in recordings and shared on the Internet on a minute-by-minute basis. These recordings, which are predominantly videos, constitute the largest archive of sounds we know. However, most of these recordings have undescribed content making necessary methods for automatic sound analysis, indexing and retrieval. These methods have to address multiple challenges, such as the relation between sounds and language, numerous and diverse sound classes, and large-scale evaluation. We propose a system that continuously learns from the web relations between sounds and language, improves sound recognition models over time and evaluates its learning competency in the large-scale without references. We introduce the Never-Ending Learner of Sounds (NELS), a project for continuously learning of sounds and their associated knowledge, available on line in nels.cs.cmu.edu

声音对于人类如何看待世界并与世界互动是必不可少的，并且被记录下来并在互联网上逐分享。这些录像，主要是视频，构成了我们所知道的最大的声音档案。然而，这些录音大部分都没有描述内容，为自动声音分析，索引和检索提供了必要的方法。这些方法必须解决多种挑战，如声音与语言的关系，多种多样的声音类别，以及大规模的评估。我们提出了一个系统，不断从网络的声音和语言之间的关系学习，提高声音识别模型随着时间的推移和大规模评估其学习能力没有参考。我们介绍了声音的永无止境的学习者（NELS），一个不断学习声音及其相关知识的项目，可在nels.cs.cmu.edu
