##### Abstract
This paper presents work on modelling the social psychological aspect of socialization in the case of a computationally creative master-apprentice system. In each master-apprentice pair, the master, a genetic algorithm, is seen as a parent for its apprentice, which is an NMT based sequence-to-sequence model. The effect of different parenting styles on the creative output of each pair is in the focus of this study. This approach brings a novel view point to computational social creativity, which has mainly focused in the past on computationally creative agents being on a socially equal level, whereas our approach studies the phenomenon in the context of a social hierarchy.
