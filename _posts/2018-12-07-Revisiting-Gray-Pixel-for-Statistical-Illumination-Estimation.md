##### Abstract
We present a statistical color constancy method that relies on novel gray pixel detection and mean shift clustering. The method, called Mean Shifted Grey Pixel -- MSGP, is based on the observation: true-gray pixels are aligned towards one single direction. Our solution is compact, easy to compute and requires no training. Experiments on two real-world benchmarks show that the proposed approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods in the camera-agnostic scenario. In the setting where the camera is known, MSGP outperforms all statistical methods.
