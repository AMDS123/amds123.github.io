##### Abstract
Optical flow estimation is one of the most studied problems in computer vision, yet recent benchmark datasets continue to reveal problem areas of today's approaches. Occlusions have remained one of the key challenges. In this paper, we propose a symmetric optical flow method to address the well-known chicken-and-egg relation between optical flow and occlusions. In contrast to many state-of-the-art methods that consider occlusions as outliers, possibly filtered out during post-processing, we highlight the importance of joint occlusion reasoning in the optimization and show how to utilize occlusion as an important cue for estimating optical flow. The key feature of our model is to fully exploit the symmetry properties that characterize optical flow and occlusions in the two consecutive images. Specifically through utilizing forward-backward consistency and occlusion-disocclusion symmetry in the energy, our model jointly estimates optical flow in both forward and backward direction, as well as consistent occlusion maps in both views. We demonstrate significant performance benefits on standard benchmarks, especially from the occlusion-disocclusion symmetry. On the challenging KITTI dataset we report the most accurate two-frame results to date.

光流估计是计算机视觉中研究最多的问题之一，但最近的基准数据集继续揭示当今方法的问题领域。阻塞仍然是主要挑战之一。在本文中，我们提出了一个对称的光流方法来解决众所周知的光流与遮挡之间的鸡与蛋的关系。与许多将遮挡视为异常值的现有技术方法相比，在后处理过程中可能将其滤除，我们强调了在优化中联合遮挡推理的重要性，并展示了如何利用遮挡作为估计光学的重要提示流。我们的模型的关键特征是充分利用表征两个连续图像中的光流和遮挡的对称特性。具体而言，通过利用能量的前后一致性和遮挡 - 断续对称性，我们的模型联合估计前向和后向的光流，以及两个视图中一致的遮挡图。我们证明在标准基准测试中有显着的性能优势，特别是从遮挡 - 隔离对称性。在具有挑战性的KITTI数据集上，我们报告了迄今为止最准确的两帧结果。
