##### Abstract
Face age progression, which aims to predict the future looks, is important for various applications and has been received considerable attentions. Existing methods and datasets are limited in exploring the effects of occupations which may influence the personal appearances. In this paper, we firstly introduce an occupational face aging dataset for studying the influences of occupations on the appearances. It includes five occupations, which enables the development of new algorithms for age progression and facilitate future researches. Second, we propose a new occupational-aware adversarial face aging network, which learns human aging process under different occupations. Two factors are taken into consideration in our aging process: personality-preserving and visually plausible texture change for different occupations. We propose personalized network with personalized loss in deep autoencoder network for keeping personalized facial characteristics, and occupational-aware adversarial network with occupational-aware adversarial loss for obtaining more realistic texture changes. Experimental results well demonstrate the advantages of the proposed method by comparing with other state-of-the-arts age progression methods.

面对时代发展，旨在预测未来的外观，对于各种应用而言是重要的，并受到相当多的关注。现有的方法和数据集在探索可能影响个人表象的职业的影响方面是有限的。在本文中，我们首先介绍一个职业面部老化数据集，研究职业对外观的影响。它包括五个职业，这使得开发新的算法的年龄进展和方便未来的研究。其次，我们提出了一个新的职业意识对抗面部老化网络，它学习了不同职业下的人体老化过程。老化过程中考虑了两个因素：不同职业的个性保持和视觉上合理的质地变化。在深度自编码器网络中，我们提出个性化丢失的个性化网络，以保持个性化的面部特征，以及具有职业意识的对抗性损失的职业意识对抗网络，以获得更逼真的纹理变化。实验结果很好地证明了所提出的方法的优点，通过与其他艺术水平的年龄进展方法进行比较。
