##### Abstract
Cascaded regression has been recently applied to reconstructing 3D faces from single 2D images directly in shape space, and achieved state-of-the-art performance. This paper investigates thoroughly such cascaded regression based 3D face reconstruction approaches from four perspectives that are not well studied yet: (i) The impact of the number of 2D landmarks; (ii) the impact of the number of 3D vertices; (iii) the way of using standalone automated landmark detection methods; and (iv) the convergence property. To answer these questions, a simplified cascaded regression based 3D face reconstruction method is devised, which can be integrated with standalone automated landmark detection methods and reconstruct 3D face shapes that have the same pose and expression as the input face images, rather than normalized pose and expression. Moreover, an effective training method is proposed by disturbing the automatically detected landmarks. Comprehensive evaluation experiments have been done with comparison to other 3D face reconstruction methods. The results not only deepen the understanding of cascaded regression based 3D face reconstruction approaches, but also prove the effectiveness of proposed method.

级联回归最近被应用于直接在形状空间中从单个2D图像重建3D面，并获得了最先进的性能。本文从四个角度深入研究了这种基于级联回归的三维人脸重建方法：（i）二维地标数量的影响; （ii）3D顶点数量的影响; （iii）使用独立式自动界标检测方法的方法;和（四）收敛性。为了回答这些问题，设计了一种简化的基于级联回归的三维人脸重建方法，该方法可以与独立的自动标志检测方法相结合，重建与输入人脸图像具有相同姿势和表情的三维人脸形状，而不是归一化的姿态和表达。而且，通过干扰自动检测的地标，提出了一种有效的训练方法。已经完成了与其他三维人脸重建方法的综合评估实验。该结果不仅加深了对基于三维人脸重建方法的级联回归的理解，而且证明了所提方法的有效性。
