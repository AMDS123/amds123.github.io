##### Abstract
Statistical methods have been widely employed in many practical natural language processing applications. More specifically, complex networks concepts and methods from dynamical systems theory have been successfully applied to recognize stylistic patterns in written texts. Despite the large amount of studies devoted to represent texts with physical models, only a few studies have assessed the relevance of attributes derived from the analysis of stylistic fluctuations. Because fluctuations represent a pivotal factor for characterizing a myriad of real systems, this study focused on the analysis of the properties of stylistic fluctuations in texts via topological analysis of complex networks and intermittency measurements. The results showed that different authors display distinct fluctuation patterns. In particular, it was found that it is possible to identify the authorship of books using the intermittency of specific words. Taken together, the results described here suggest that the patterns found in stylistic fluctuations could be used to analyze other related complex systems. Furthermore, the discovery of novel patterns related to textual stylistic fluctuations indicates that these patterns could be useful to improve the state of the art of many stylistic-based natural language processing tasks.

##### Abstract (translated by Google)
统计方法已被广泛应用于许多实际的自然语言处理应用中。更具体地说，来自动态系统理论的复杂网络概念和方法已经被成功应用于识别书面文本中的文体模式。尽管大量的研究致力于用物理模型来表示文本，但只有少数研究评估了文体波动分析所得属性的相关性。由于波动是表征大量实际系统的关键因素，本研究通过复杂网络的拓扑分析和间歇性测量，重点分析了文本中文体波动特性。结果显示不同的作者显示明显的波动模式。特别是，发现使用特定词语的间歇性可以确定书籍的作者身份。总之，这里描述的结果表明，风格波动中发现的模式可以用来分析其他相关的复杂系统。此外，发现与文本风格波动有关的新颖模式表明，这些模式可能有助于改善许多基于文体的自然语言处理任务的艺术状态。
