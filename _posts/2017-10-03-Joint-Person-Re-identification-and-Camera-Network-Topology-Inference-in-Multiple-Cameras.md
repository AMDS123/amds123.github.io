##### Abstract
Person re-identification is the task of recognizing or identifying a person across multiple views in multi-camera networks. Although there has been much progress in person re-identification, person re-identification in large-scale multi-camera networks still remains a challenging task because of the large spatio-temporal uncertainty and high complexity due to a large number of cameras and people. To handle these difficulties, additional information such as camera network topology should be provided, which is also difficult to automatically estimate, unfortunately. In this study, we propose a unified framework which jointly solves both person re-identification and camera network topology inference problems with minimal prior knowledge about the environments. The proposed framework takes general multi-camera network environments into account and can be applied to online person re-identification in large-scale multi-camera networks. In addition, to effectively show the superiority of the proposed framework, we provide a new person re-identification dataset with full annotations, named SLP, captured in the multi-camera network consisting of nine non-overlapping cameras. Experimental results using our person re-identification and public datasets show that the proposed methods are promising for both person re-identification and camera topology inference tasks.

人员重新识别是在多摄像机网络中跨多个视图识别或识别人员的任务。虽然人类重新识别技术的研究取得了很大的进展，但由于大量的摄像机和人员，其时空不确定性和复杂度较高，大型多摄像机网络中的人员重新识别仍然是一个具有挑战性的任务。为了处理这些困难，应该提供附加的信息，例如摄像机网络拓扑结构，这也是很难自动估计的，不幸的是。在这项研究中，我们提出了一个统一的框架，联合解决人重新识别和摄像机网络拓扑推理问题，对环境的最小知识。该框架考虑了一般的多摄像机网络环境，可应用于大型多摄像机网络中的在线人员重新识别。此外，为了有效地展示所提出的框架的优越性，我们提供了一个新的人重新识别数据集，其中包含全部注释，命名为SLP，在由九个非重叠摄像机组成的多摄像机网络中捕获。利用人重新识别和公开数据集的实验结果表明，所提出的方法对于人重新识别和相机拓扑推断任务都是有希望的。
