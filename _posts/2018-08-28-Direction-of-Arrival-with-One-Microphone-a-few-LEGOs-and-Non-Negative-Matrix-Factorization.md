##### Abstract
Conventional approaches to sound source localization require at least two microphones. It is known, however, that people with unilateral hearing loss can also localize sounds. Monaural localization is possible thanks to the scattering by the head, though it hinges on learning the spectra of the various sources. We take inspiration from this human ability to propose algorithms for accurate sound source localization using a single microphone embedded in an arbitrary scattering structure. The structure modifies the frequency response of the microphone in a direction-dependent way giving each direction a signature. While knowing those signatures is sufficient to localize sources of white noise, localizing speech is much more challenging: it is an ill-posed inverse problem which we regularize by prior knowledge in the form of learned non-negative dictionaries. We demonstrate a monaural speech localization algorithm based on non-negative matrix factorization that does not depend on sophisticated, designed scatterers. In fact, we show experimental results with ad hoc scatterers made of LEGO bricks. Even with these rudimentary structures we can accurately localize arbitrary speakers; that is, we do not need to learn the dictionary for the particular speaker to be localized. Finally, we discuss multi-source localization and the related limitations of our approach.

声源定位的传统方法需要至少两个麦克风。然而，众所周知，单侧听力损失的人也可以定位声音。由于头部的散射，单声道定位是可能的，尽管它取决于学习各种光源的光谱。我们从这种人类能力中汲取灵感，使用嵌入在任意散射结构中的单个麦克风来提出用于精确声源定位的算法。该结构以与方向相关的方式修改麦克风的频率响应，从而为每个方向提供签名。虽然知道这些签名足以定位白噪声源，但语音定位更具挑战性：它是一个不适定的逆问题，我们通过先前的知识以学习的非负词典的形式规范。我们演示了一种基于非负矩阵分解的单声道语音定位算法，该算法不依赖于复杂的设计散射体。事实上，我们展示了由乐高积木制成的临时散射体的实验结果。即使有这些基本结构，我们也可以准确地定位任意说话者;也就是说，我们不需要学习特定说话者本地化的字典。最后，我们讨论了多源本地化以及我们方法的相关局限性。
