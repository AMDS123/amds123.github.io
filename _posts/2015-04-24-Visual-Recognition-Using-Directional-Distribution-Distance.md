##### Abstract
In computer vision, an entity such as an image or video is often represented as a set of instance vectors, which can be SIFT, motion, or deep learning feature vectors extracted from different parts of that entity. Thus, it is essential to design efficient and effective methods to compare two sets of instance vectors. Existing methods such as FV, VLAD or Super Vectors have achieved excellent results. However, this paper shows that these methods are designed based on a generative perspective, and a discriminative method can be more effective in categorizing images or videos. The proposed D3 (discriminative distribution distance) method effectively compares two sets as two distributions, and proposes a directional total variation distance (DTVD) to measure how separated are they. Furthermore, a robust classifier-based method is proposed to estimate DTVD robustly. The D3 method is evaluated in action and image recognition tasks and has achieved excellent accuracy and speed. D3 also has a synergy with FV. The combination of D3 and FV has advantages over D3, FV, and VLAD.

在计算机视觉中，像图像或视频这样的实体通常被表示为一组实例向量，其可以是SIFT，运动或从该实体的不同部分提取的深度学习特征向量。因此，设计有效的方法来比较两组实例向量是非常重要的。现有的方法如FV，VLAD或超级载体已经取得了优异的结果。然而，本文表明，这些方法是基于生成的角度来设计的，而区分方法可以更有效地对图像或视频进行分类。提出的D3（有差别分布距离）方法有效地比较两组为两个分布，并提出一个方向总变化距离（DTVD）来衡量它们是如何分离的。此外，本文提出了一种鲁棒分类器的鲁棒估计方法。 D3方法在动作和图像识别任务中得到了评估，并取得了出色的准确性和速度。 D3也与FV有协同作用。 D3和FV的组合优于D3，FV和VLAD。
