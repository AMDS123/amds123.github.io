##### Abstract
Ear recognition task is known as predicting whether two ear images belong to the same person or not. In this paper, we present a novel metric learning method for ear recognition. This method is formulated as a pairwise constrained optimization problem. In each training cycle, this method selects the nearest similar and dissimilar neighbors of each sample to construct the pairwise constraints, and then solve the optimization problem by the iterated Bregman projections. Experiments are conducted on AMI, USTB II and WPUT databases. The results show that the proposed approach can achieve promising recognition rates in ear recognition, and its training process is much more efficient than the other competing metric learning methods.

耳朵识别任务被称为预测两个耳朵图像是否属于同一个人。在本文中，我们提出了一种新的用于耳朵识别的度量学习方法。该方法被制定为成对约束优化问题。在每个训练周期中，该方法选择每个样本中最近的相似和不相似的邻居来构造成对约束，然后通过迭代Bregman预测来求解优化问题。在AMI，USTB II和WPUT数据库上进行实验。结果表明，所提出的方法可以在耳朵识别中实现有前途的识别率，并且其训练过程比其他竞争性度量学习方法更有效。
