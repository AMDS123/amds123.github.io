##### Abstract
An early stage of developing user-facing applications is creating a wireframe to layout the interface. Once a wireframe has been created it is given to a developer to implement in code. Developing boiler plate user interface code is time consuming work but still requires an experienced developer. In this dissertation we present two approaches which automates this process, one using classical computer vision techniques, and another using a novel application of deep semantic segmentation networks. We release a dataset of websites which can be used to train and evaluate these approaches. Further, we have designed a novel evaluation framework which allows empirical evaluation by creating synthetic sketches. Our evaluation illustrates that our deep learning approach outperforms our classical computer vision approach and we conclude that deep learning is the most promising direction for future research.
