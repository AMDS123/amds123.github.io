##### Abstract
Image change detection (ICD) to detect changed objects in front of a vehicle with respect to a place-specific background model using an on-board monocular vision system is a fundamental problem in intelligent vehicle (IV). From the perspective of recent large-scale IV applications, it can be impractical in terms of space/time efficiency to train place-specific background models for every possible place. To address these issues, we introduce a new autoencoder (AE) based efficient ICD framework that combines the advantages of AE-based anomaly detection (AD) and AE-based image compression (IC). We propose a method that uses AE reconstruction errors as a single unified measure for training a minimal set of place-specific AEs and maintains detection accuracy. We introduce an efficient incremental recursive AE (rAE) training framework that recursively summarizes a large collection of background images into the AE set. The results of experiments on challenging cross-season ICD tasks validate the efficacy of the proposed approach.
