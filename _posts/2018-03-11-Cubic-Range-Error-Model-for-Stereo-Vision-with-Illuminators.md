##### Abstract
Use of low-cost depth sensors, such as a stereo camera setup with illuminators, is of particular interest for numerous applications ranging from robotics and transportation to mixed and augmented reality. The ability to quantify noise is crucial for these applications, e.g., when the sensor is used for map generation or to develop a sensor scheduling policy in a multi-sensor setup. Range error models provide uncertainty estimates and help weigh the data correctly in instances where range measurements are taken from different vantage points or with different sensors. The weighing is important to fuse range data into a map in a meaningful way, i.e., the high confidence data is relied on most heavily. Such a model is derived in this work. We show that the range error for stereo systems with integrated illuminators is cubic and validate the proposed model experimentally with an off-the-shelf structured light stereo system. The experiments confirm the validity of the model and simplify the application of this type of sensor in robotics. The proposed error model is relevant to any stereo system with low ambient light where the main light source is located at the camera system. Among others, this is the case for structured light stereo systems and night stereo systems with headlights. In this work, we propose that the range error is cubic in range for stereo systems with integrated illuminators. Experimental validation with an off-the-shelf structured light stereo system shows that the exponent is between 2.4 and 2.6. The deviation is attributed to our model considering only shot noise.

使用低成本深度传感器，例如带照明器的立体相机设置，对于从机器人和运输到混合和增强现实等众多应用而言，特别令人感兴趣。量化噪声的能力对于这些应用至关重要，例如，当传感器用于地图生成或在多传感器设置中开发传感器调度策略时。距离误差模型提供不确定性估计，并有助于在从不同有利位置或不同传感器获取距离测量值的情况下正确衡量数据。称重对于以有意义的方式将范围数据融合到地图中是重要的，即高置信度数据依赖最多。这种模型是在这项工作中得出的。我们表明，具有集成照明器的立体系统的距离误差是立方体，并通过实验性地用现成的结构化光立体声系统验证所提出的模型。实验证实了该模型的有效性，并简化了这种类型的传感器在机器人技术中的应用。所提出的误差模型与任何具有低环境光的立体系统相关，其中主光源位于相机系统处。其中，结构化灯光立体声系统和带前灯的夜间立体声系统就是这种情况。在这项工作中，我们建议对于集成照明器的立体声系统，距离误差在三倍范围内。使用现成结构光立体声系统进行实验验证表明，指数介于2.4和2.6之间。偏差仅归因于我们的模型仅考虑散粒噪声。
