##### Abstract
Domestic Violence (DV) is considered as big social issue and there exists a strong relationship between DV and health impacts of the public. Existing research studies have focused on social media to track and analyse real world events like emerging trends, natural disasters, user sentiment analysis, political opinions, and health care. However there is less attention given on social welfare issues like DV and its impact on public health. Recently, the victims of DV turned to social media platforms to express their feelings in the form of posts and seek the social and emotional support, for sympathetic encouragement, to show compassion and empathy among public. But, it is difficult to mine the actionable knowledge from large conversational datasets from social media due to the characteristics of high dimensions, short, noisy, huge volume, high velocity, and so on. Hence, this paper will propose a novel framework to model and discover the various themes related to DV from the public domain. The proposed framework would possibly provide unprecedentedly valuable information to the public health researchers, national family health organizations, government and public with data enrichment and consolidation to improve the social welfare of the community. Thus provides actionable knowledge by monitoring and analysing continuous and rich user generated content.

##### Abstract (translated by Google)
家庭暴力（DV）被认为是一个重大的社会问题，DV与公众健康影响之间存在着密切的关系。现有的研究重点是社交媒体，以跟踪和分析现实世界的事件，如新兴趋势，自然灾害，用户情绪分析，政治观点和医疗保健。然而，对DV等社会福利问题及其对公共健康的影响的关注较少。最近，DV的受害者转向社交媒体平台，以帖子的形式表达自己的感受，寻求社会和情感上的支持，同情的鼓励，表达公众的同情和同情。但是，由于高维度，短小，嘈杂，大容量，高速度等特点，很难从社交媒体的大型会话数据集中挖掘出可操作的知识。因此，本文将提出一个新的框架来模拟和发现与公共领域的DV相关的各种主题。拟议的框架可能会为公共卫生研究人员，国家家庭健康组织，政府和公众提供前所未有的有价值的信息，并进行数据丰富和整合，以改善社区的社会福利。因此，通过监视和分析连续和丰富的用户生成内容来提供可操作的知识。
