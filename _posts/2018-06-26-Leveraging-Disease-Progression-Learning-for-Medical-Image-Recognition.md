##### Abstract
Unlike natural images, medical images often have intrinsic characteristics that can be leveraged for neural network learning. For example, images that belong to different stages of a disease may continuously follow certain progression pattern. In this paper, we propose a novel method that leverages disease progression learning for medical image recognition, where sequences of images ordered by disease stages are learned by a neural network that consists of a shared vision model for feature extraction and a long short-term memory network for the learning of stage sequences. Auxiliary vision outputs are also included to capture stage features that tend to be discrete along disease progression. Our proposed method is evaluated on a diabetic retinopathy dataset, and achieves about 3.3% improvement in disease staging accuracy, compared to the baseline method that does not use disease progression learning.

与自然图像不同，医学图像通常具有可用于神经网络学习的内在特征。例如，属于疾病不同阶段的图像可能会持续遵循某种进展模式。在本文中，我们提出了一种利用疾病进展学习进行医学图像识别的新方法，其中按疾病阶段排序的图像序列由神经网络学习，所述神经网络包括用于特征提取的共享视觉模型和长期的短期记忆网络学习阶段序列。辅助视力输出也被包括用于捕捉在疾病进展中趋于离散的阶段特征。我们提出的方法在糖尿病性视网膜病变数据集上进行评估，与不使用疾病进展学习的基线方法相比，疾病分期准确性提高了约3.3％。
