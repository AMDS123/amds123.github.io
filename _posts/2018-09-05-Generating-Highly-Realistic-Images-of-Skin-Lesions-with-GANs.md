##### Abstract
As many other machine learning driven medical image analysis tasks, skin image analysis suffers from a chronic lack of labeled data and skewed class distributions, which poses problems for the training of robust and well-generalizing models. The ability to synthesize realistic looking images of skin lesions could act as a reliever for the aforementioned problems. Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have been successfully used to synthesize realistically looking medical images, however limited to low resolution, whereas machine learning models for challenging tasks such as skin lesion segmentation or classification benefit from much higher resolution data. In this work, we successfully synthesize realistically looking images of skin lesions with GANs at such high resolution. Therefore, we utilize the concept of progressive growing, which we both quantitatively and qualitatively compare to other GAN architectures such as the DCGAN and the LAPGAN. Our results show that with the help of progressive growing, we can synthesize highly realistic dermoscopic images of skin lesions that even expert dermatologists find hard to distinguish from real ones.

与许多其他机器学习驱动的医学图像分析任务一样，皮肤图像分析遭受长期缺乏标记数据和偏斜类分布的困扰，这给训练强大且通用性良好的模型带来了问题。合成逼真的皮肤病变图像的能力可以作为上述问题的缓解。生成性对抗网络（GAN）已经成功地用于合成逼真的医学图像，但是仅限于低分辨率，而用于诸如皮肤病变分割或分类的挑战性任务的机器学习模型受益于更高分辨率的数据。在这项工作中，我们成功地用如此高分辨率的GAN合成逼真的皮肤病变图像。因此，我们利用渐进式增长的概念，我们在定量和定性上与其他GAN架构（如DCGAN和LAPGAN）进行比较。我们的研究结果表明，在渐进式生长的帮助下，我们可以合成高度真实的皮肤病皮肤图像，甚至专家皮肤科医生也难以区分真实皮肤病。
