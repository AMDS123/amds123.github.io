##### Abstract
Recent advances in community detection reveal new insights into multiplex, time-dependent, and heterogeneously structured networks. Less work, however, empirically investigates the relationship between membership in these communities and observable outcomes in social systems. We investigate this question in the domain of politics with an application to a crucial outcome of scholarly interest: the onset of violent conflict in the international system. We differentiate between stronger signals of observed relations and weaker signals of affinity and perform multilayer community detection to locate dense multiplex blocs of countries. Although it is often assumed that detected communities are associated with cooperative outcomes, we find evidence that membership in these communities can also be a significant predictor of conflict. The results point to the need to devote more empirical attention to the relationship between different tie types and observed network outcomes in community detection research.

社区检测的最新进展揭示了对多路复用，时间依赖和异构结构网络的新见解。但是，较少的工作通过实证研究这些社区成员与社会系统中可观察到的结果之间的关系。我们在政治领域调查这个问题，并应用于学术兴趣的一个关键结果：国际体系中暴力冲突的发生。我们区分观察到的关系的更强信号和更弱的亲和信号，并执行多层社区检测以定位各国密集的多重区块。虽然人们通常认为检测到的社区与合作成果相关，但我们发现证据表明这些社区的成员资格也可以成为冲突的重要预测因子。结果表明需要对社区检测研究中不同类型的关系和观察到的网络结果给予更多的经验关注。
