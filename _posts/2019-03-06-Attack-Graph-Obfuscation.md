##### Abstract
Before executing an attack, adversaries usually explore the victim's network in an attempt to infer the network topology and identify vulnerabilities in the victim's servers and personal computers. Falsifying the information collected by the adversary post penetration may significantly slower lateral movement and increase the amount of noise generated within the victim's network. We investigate the effect of fake vulnerabilities within a real enterprise network on the attacker performance. We use the attack graphs to model the path of an attacker making its way towards a target in a given network. We use combinatorial optimization in order to find the optimal assignments of fake vulnerabilities. We demonstrate the feasibility of our deception-based defense by presenting results of experiments with a large scale real network. We show that adding fake vulnerabilities forces the adversary to invest a significant amount of effort, in terms of time and exploitability cost.
