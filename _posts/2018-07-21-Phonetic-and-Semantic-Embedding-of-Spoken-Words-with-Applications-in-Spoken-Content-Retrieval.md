##### Abstract
Word embedding or Word2Vec has been successful in offering semantics for text words learned from the context of words. Audio Word2Vec was shown to offer phonetic structures for spoken words (signal segments for words) learned from signals within spoken words. This paper proposes a two-stage framework to perform phonetic-and-semantic embedding on spoken words considering the context of the spoken words. Stage 1 performs phonetic embedding with speaker characteristics disentangled. Stage 2 then performs semantic embedding in addition. We further propose to evaluate the phonetic-and-semantic nature of the audio embeddings obtained in Stage 2 by parallelizing with text embeddings. In general, phonetic structure and semantics inevitably disturb each other. For example the words "brother" and "sister" are close in semantics but very different in phonetic structure, while the words "brother" and "bother" are in the other way around. But phonetic-and-semantic embedding is attractive, as shown in the initial experiments on spoken document retrieval. Not only spoken documents including the spoken query can be retrieved based on the phonetic structures, but spoken documents semantically related to the query but not including the query can also be retrieved based on the semantics.

Word嵌入或Word2Vec已成功地为从单词上下文中学习的文本单词提供语义。音频Word2Vec被证明可以提供从口语中的信号中学习的口语单词（单词的信号段）的语音结构。本文提出了一个两阶段框架，用于考虑口语单词的语境对口语进行语音和语义嵌入。第1阶段执行语音嵌入，扬声器特性解开。然后，阶段2执行语义嵌入。我们进一步建议通过与文本嵌入并行化来评估在阶段2中获得的音频嵌入的语音和语义性质。通常，语音结构和语义不可避免地相互干扰。例如，单词“brother”和“sister”在语义上是接近的，但在语音结构上是非常不同的，而“兄弟”和“打扰”这两个词则相反。但语音和语义嵌入很有吸引力，如口语文档检索的初步实验所示。不仅可以基于语音结构来检索包括口头查询的口头文档，而且还可以基于语义来检索在语义上与查询相关但不包括查询的口头文档。
