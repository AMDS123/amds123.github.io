##### Abstract
In the design of user-friendly robots, human communication should be understood by the system beyond mere logics and literal meaning.

Through analysis of the psychological causes of illogical and non-literal statements, signal detection, fundamental attribution errors, and anthropomorphism, we developed a fail-safe protocol for fallacies and tropes that makes use of Frege's distinction between reference and sense, Beth's tableau analytics, Grice's maxim of quality, and epistemic considerations to have the robot politely make sense of a user's sometimes unintelligible demands. Keywords: social robots, logical fallacies, metaphors, reference, sense, maxim of quality, tableau reasoning, epistemics of the virtual
