##### Abstract
The 3D documentation of the tunnel surface during construction requires fast and robust measurement systems. In the solution proposed in this paper, during tunnel advance a single camera is taking pictures of the tunnel surface from several positions. The recorded images are automatically processed to gain a 3D tunnel surface model. Image acquisition is realized by the tunneling/advance/driving personnel close to the tunnel face (= the front end of the advance). Based on the following fully automatic analysis/evaluation, a decision on the quality of the outbreak can be made within a few minutes. This paper describes the image recording system and conditions as well as the stereo-photogrammetry based workflow for the continuously merged dense 3D reconstruction of the entire advance region. Geo-reference is realized by means of signalized targets that are automatically detected in the images. We report on the results of recent testing under real construction conditions, and conclude with prospects for further development in terms of on-site performance.

施工期间隧道表面的三维文件需要快速和可靠的测量系统。在本文提出的解决方案中，在隧道推进期间，单个摄像机从几个位置拍摄隧道表面。记录的图像被自动处理以获得3D隧道表面模型。图像采集由靠近隧道面的掘进/前进/驾驶人员（=前进的前端）实现。基于以下全自动分析/评估，可以在几分钟内就爆发的质量做出决定。本文介绍了图像记录系统和条件以及基于立体摄影测量的工作流程，用于整个前进区域的连续合并稠密三维重建。地理参考是通过在图像中自动检测到的信号化目标来实现的。我们汇报了最近在实际建设条件下的测试结果，并总结了现场表现的进一步发展前景。
