##### Abstract
Multi-view registration is a fundamental but challenging problem in 3D reconstruction and robot vision. Although the original motion averaging algorithm has been introduced as an effective means to solve the multi-view registration problem, it does not consider the reliability and accuracy of each relative motion. Accordingly, this paper proposes a novel motion averaging algorithm for multi-view registration. Firstly, it utilizes the pair-wise registration algorithm to estimate the relative motion and overlapping percentage of each scan pair with a certain degree of overlap. With the overlapping percentage available, it views the overlapping percentage as the corresponding weight of each scan pair and proposes the weight motion averaging algorithm, which can pay more attention to reliable and accurate relative motions. By treating each relative motion distinctively, more accurate registration can be achieved by applying the weighted motion averaging to multi-view range scans. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our proposed approach compared with the state-of-the-art methods in terms of accuracy, robustness and efficiency.

多视点配准是三维重建和机器人视觉中的一个基本而又具有挑战性的问题。尽管原始运动平均算法作为解决多视图配准问题的有效手段已经被引入，但它并没有考虑每个相对运动的可靠性和准确性。因此，本文提出了一种新的多视点注册运动平均算法。首先利用成对配准算法估计每个扫描对的相对运动和重叠百分比，并进行一定程度的重叠。在重叠百分比可用的情况下，将重叠百分比视为每个扫描对的相应权重，提出权重运动平均算法，可以更加注重可靠和准确的相对运动。通过对每个相对运动进行有区别的处理，可以通过对多视野范围扫描应用加权运动平均来实现更准确的配准。实验结果证明了我们所提出的方法在精度，鲁棒性和效率方面与现有技术方法相比的优越性。
