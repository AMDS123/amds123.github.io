##### Abstract
Recent work in reinforcement learning demonstrated that learning solely through self-play is not only possible, but could also result in novel strategies that humans never would have thought of. However, optimization methods cast as a game between two players require careful tuning to prevent suboptimal results. Hence, we look at random play as an alternative method. In this paper, we train a DQN agent to play Sungka, a two-player turn-based board game wherein the players compete to obtain more stones than the other. We show that even with purely random play, our training algorithm converges very fast and is stable. Moreover, we test our trained agent against several baselines and show its ability to consistently win against these.
