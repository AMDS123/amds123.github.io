##### Abstract
Multi-attributed graph matching is a problem of finding correspondences between two sets of data while considering their complex properties described in multiple attributes. However, the information of multiple attributes is likely to be oversimplified during a process that makes an integrated attribute, and this degrades the matching accuracy. For that reason, a multi-layer graph structure-based algorithm has been proposed recently. It can effectively avoid the problem by separating attributes into multiple layers. Nonetheless, there are several remaining issues such as a scalability problem caused by the huge matrix to describe the multi-layer structure and a back-projection problem caused by the continuous relaxation of the quadratic assignment problem. In this work, we propose a novel multi-attributed graph matching algorithm based on the multi-layer graph factorization. We reformulate the problem to be solved with several small matrices that are obtained by factorizing the multi-layer structure. Then, we solve the problem using a convex-concave relaxation procedure for the multi-layer structure. The proposed algorithm exhibits better performance than state-of-the-art algorithms based on the single-layer structure.

多属性图匹配是在考虑它们在多个属性中描述的复杂属性的同时找到两组数据之间的对应关系的问题。然而，在综合属性的过程中，多属性的信息很可能过于简化，这就降低了匹配的准确性。出于这个原因，最近已经提出了基于多层图形结构的算法。它可以通过将属性分成多层来有效地避免这个问题。尽管如此，还存在着一些剩余的问题，例如巨大的矩阵描述多层结构所引起的可伸缩性问题，以及由二次分配问题的连续松弛引起的反投影问题。在这项工作中，我们提出了一种基于多层图分解的新型多属性图匹配算法。我们用多个小矩阵来重新构造需要解决的问题，这些小矩阵是通过分解多层结构得到的。然后，我们使用多层结构的凸凹松弛过程来解决问题。所提出的算法比基于单层结构的最新算法具有更好的性能。
