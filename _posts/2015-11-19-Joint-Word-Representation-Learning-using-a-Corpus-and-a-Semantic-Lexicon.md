##### Abstract
Methods for learning word representations using large text corpora have received much attention lately due to their impressive performance in numerous natural language processing (NLP) tasks such as, semantic similarity measurement, and word analogy detection. Despite their success, these data-driven word representation learning methods do not consider the rich semantic relational structure between words in a co-occurring context. On the other hand, already much manual effort has gone into the construction of semantic lexicons such as the WordNet that represent the meanings of words by defining the various relationships that exist among the words in a language. We consider the question, can we improve the word representations learnt using a corpora by integrating the knowledge from semantic lexicons?. For this purpose, we propose a joint word representation learning method that simultaneously predicts the co-occurrences of two words in a sentence subject to the relational constrains given by the semantic lexicon. We use relations that exist between words in the lexicon to regularize the word representations learnt from the corpus. Our proposed method statistically significantly outperforms previously proposed methods for incorporating semantic lexicons into word representations on several benchmark datasets for semantic similarity and word analogy.

使用大型文本语料库学习单词表示的方法由于其在许多自然语言处理（NLP）任务（诸如语义相似度测量和词类比检测）中的令人印象深刻的性能而近来受到广泛关注。这些数据驱动的词表示学习方法尽管取得了成功，但并没有考虑共现语境中词间丰富的语义关系结构。另一方面，通过定义语言中的词语之间存在的各种关系，已经有许多人工努力已经被用于构建诸如WordNet的语义词典，其代表词语的含义。我们考虑这个问题，我们是否可以通过整合来自语义词典的知识来改进使用语料库学习的单词表示？为此，我们提出了一种联合词表征学习方法，它同时预测句子中两个词的共现，受到语义词典给出的关系约束。我们使用词典中的单词之间的关系来规范从语料库中学习的单词表示。我们提出的方法在统计学上明显优于先前提出的用于在语义相似度和词类比的几个基准数据集上将语义词典纳入词表示的方法。
