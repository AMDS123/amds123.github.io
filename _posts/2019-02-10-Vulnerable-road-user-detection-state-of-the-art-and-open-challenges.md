##### Abstract
Correctly identifying vulnerable road users (VRUs), e.g. cyclists and pedestrians, remains one of the most challenging environment perception tasks for autonomous vehicles (AVs). This work surveys the current state-of-the-art in VRU detection, covering topics such as benchmarks and datasets, object detection techniques and relevant machine learning algorithms. The article concludes with a discussion of remaining open challenges and promising future research directions for this domain.
