##### Abstract
Obstacle Detection is a central problem for any robotic system, and critical for autonomous systems that travel at high speeds in unpredictable environment. This is often achieved through scene depth estimation, by various means. When fast motion is considered, the detection range must be longer enough to allow for safe avoidance and path planning. Current solutions often make assumption on the motion of the vehicle that limit their applicability, or work at very limited ranges due to intrinsic constraints. We propose a novel appearance-based Object Detection system that is able to detect obstacles at very long range and at a very high speed (~300Hz), without making assumptions on the type of motion. We achieve these results using a Deep Neural Network approach trained on real and synthetic images and trading some depth accuracy for fast, robust and consistent operation. We show how photo-realistic synthetic images are able to solve the problem of training set dimension and variety typical of machine learning approaches, and how our system is robust to massive blurring of test images.

障碍物检测是任何机器人系统的核心问题，对于在不可预知的环境中以高速行进的自主系统而言至关重要。这通常通过各种手段通过场景深度估计来实现。当考虑到快速运动时，检测范围必须足够长以允许安全避免和路径规划。目前的解决方案通常假设车辆的运动限制了其适用性，或者由于固有的限制而在非常有限的范围内工作。我们提出了一种新颖的基于外观的物体检测系统，能够以很高的速度（〜300Hz）在很远的距离检测障碍物，而不需要对运动类型做出假设。我们使用深度神经网络方法实现了这些结果，这些方法训练了真实的和合成的图像，并交易了一些深度准确性以实现快速，稳健和一致的操作我们展示了照片般真实的合成图像如何能够解决机器学习方法中典型的训练集维度和变化的问题，以及我们的系统如何对测试图像的大量模糊是鲁棒的。
