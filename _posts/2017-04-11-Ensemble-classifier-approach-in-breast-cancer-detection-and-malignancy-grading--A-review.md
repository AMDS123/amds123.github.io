##### Abstract
The diagnosed cases of Breast cancer is increasing annually and unfortunately getting converted into a high mortality rate. Cancer, at the early stages, is hard to detect because the malicious cells show similar properties (density) as shown by the non-malicious cells. The mortality ratio could have been minimized if the breast cancer could have been detected in its early stages. But the current systems have not been able to achieve a fully automatic system which is not just capable of detecting the breast cancer but also can detect the stage of it. Estimation of malignancy grading is important in diagnosing the degree of growth of malicious cells as well as in selecting a proper therapy for the patient. Therefore, a complete and efficient clinical decision support system is proposed which is capable of achieving breast cancer malignancy grading scheme very efficiently. The system is based on Image processing and machine learning domains. Classification Imbalance problem, a machine learning problem, occurs when instances of one class is much higher than the instances of the other class resulting in an inefficient classification of samples and hence a bad decision support system. Therefore EUSBoost, ensemble based classifier is proposed which is efficient and is able to outperform other classifiers as it takes the benefits of both-boosting algorithm with Random Undersampling techniques. Also comparison of EUSBoost with other techniques is shown in the paper.

##### Abstract (translated by Google)
确诊的乳腺癌病例每年都在增加，不幸的是转化为高死亡率。癌症在早期阶段很难被检测到，因为恶意细胞显示出与非恶意细胞相似的性质（密度）。如果可以在早期检测到乳腺癌，死亡率可以降到最低。但目前的系统还没有能够实现一个不仅能够检测乳腺癌而且能够检测到乳腺癌的全自动系统。恶性肿瘤分级的评估对于诊断恶性细胞生长的程度以及为患者选择合适的治疗方法非常重要。因此，提出了一套完整高效的临床决策支持系统，能够非常有效地实现乳腺癌恶性程度分级方案。该系统基于图像处理和机器学习领域。分类不平衡问题是一个机器学习问题，当一个类别的实例比另一个类别的实例高得多时，会导致样本分类效率低下，从而导致错误的决策支持系统。因此，EUSBoost，基于集成的分类器被认为是有效的，并且能够胜过其他分类器，因为它利用了随机欠采样技术的增强算法。本文还介绍了EUSBoost与其他技术的比较。
