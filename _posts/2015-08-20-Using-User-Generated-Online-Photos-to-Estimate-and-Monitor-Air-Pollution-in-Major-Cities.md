##### Abstract
With the rapid development of economy in China over the past decade, air pollution has become an increasingly serious problem in major cities and caused grave public health concerns in China. Recently, a number of studies have dealt with air quality and air pollution. Among them, some attempt to predict and monitor the air quality from different sources of information, ranging from deployed physical sensors to social media. These methods are either too expensive or unreliable, prompting us to search for a novel and effective way to sense the air quality. In this study, we propose to employ the state of the art in computer vision techniques to analyze photos that can be easily acquired from online social media. Next, we establish the correlation between the haze level computed directly from photos with the official PM 2.5 record of the taken city at the taken time. Our experiments based on both synthetic and real photos have shown the promise of this image-based approach to estimating and monitoring air pollution.

随着近十年来中国经济的高速发展，空气污染问题已成为各大城市日益严重的问题，引起了国内公众的严重关注。最近，一些研究涉及空气质量和空气污染。其中，有些企图从不同的信息来源预测和监测空气质量，从部署的物理传感器到社交媒体。这些方法要么太昂贵，要么不可靠，促使我们寻求一种新颖有效的方式来感知空气质量。在这项研究中，我们建议使用计算机视觉技术的最新技术来分析可以从在线社交媒体轻松获取的照片。接下来，我们建立直接从照片计算出的雾霾等级与所采取城市的官方PM 2.5记录之间的相关性。我们基于合成和真实照片的实验已经显示了这种基于图像的方法估计和监测空气污染的前景。
