##### Abstract
News headline generation is an essential problem of text summarization because it is constrained, well-defined, and is still hard to solve. Models with a limited vocabulary can not solve it well, as new named entities can appear regularly in the news and these entities often should be in the headline. News articles in morphologically rich languages such as Russian require model modifications due to a large number of possible word forms. This study aims to validate that models with a possibility of copying words from the original article performs better than models without such an option. The proposed model achieves a mean ROUGE score of 23 on the provided test dataset, which is 8 points greater than the result of a similar model without a copying mechanism. Moreover, the resulting model performs better than any known model on the new dataset of Russian news.
