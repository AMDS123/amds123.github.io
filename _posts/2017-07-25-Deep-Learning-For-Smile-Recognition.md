##### Abstract
Inspired by recent successes of deep learning in computer vision, we propose a novel application of deep convolutional neural networks to facial expression recognition, in particular smile recognition. A smile recognition test accuracy of 99.45% is achieved for the Denver Intensity of Spontaneous Facial Action (DISFA) database, significantly outperforming existing approaches based on hand-crafted features with accuracies ranging from 65.55% to 79.67%. The novelty of this approach includes a comprehensive model selection of the architecture parameters, allowing to find an appropriate architecture for each expression such as smile. This is feasible because all experiments were run on a Tesla K40c GPU, allowing a speedup of factor 10 over traditional computations on a CPU.

受近期深度学习在计算机视觉领域的成功启发，我们提出了深度卷积神经网络在面部表情识别中的应用，特别是微笑识别。丹佛自发性面部紧张度（DISFA）数据库的笑脸识别测试准确率达到了99.45％，明显优于基于手工特征的现有方法，精确度从65.55％到79.67％不等。这种方法的新颖性包括对建筑参数的综合模型选择，从而为每个表情（例如微笑）找到适当的架构。这是可行的，因为所有的实验都是在Tesla K40c GPU上运行的，与CPU上的传统计算相比，速度提高了10倍。
