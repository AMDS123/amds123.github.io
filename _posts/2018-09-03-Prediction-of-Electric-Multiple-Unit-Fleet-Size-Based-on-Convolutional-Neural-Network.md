##### Abstract
With the expansion of high-speed railway network and growth of passenger transportation demands, the fleet size of electric multiple unit (EMU) in China needs to be adjusted accordingly. Generally, an EMU train costs tens of millions of dollars which constitutes a significant portion of capital investment. Thus, the prediction of EMU fleet size has attracted increasing attention from associated railway departments. First, this paper introduces a typical architecture of convolutional neural network (CNN) and its basic theory. Then, some data of nine indices, such as passenger traffic volume and length of high-speed railways in operation, is collected and preprocessed. Next, a CNN and a backpropagation neural network (BPNN) are constructed and trained aiming to predict EMU fleet size in the following years. The differences and performances of these two networks in computation experiments are analyzed in-depth. The results indicate that the CNN is superior to the BPNN both in generalization ability and fitting accuracy, and CNN can serve as an aid in EMU fleet size prediction.

随着高速铁路网络的扩大和客运需求的增长，中国电动多机组（EMU）的机队规模需要相应调整。通常，EMU列车花费数千万美元，这构成了资本投资的重要部分。因此，对动车组车队规模的预测引起了相关铁路部门越来越多的关注。首先，本文介绍了卷积神经网络（CNN）的典型体系结构及其基本理论。然后，收集并预处理一些9个指标的数据，如客运量和运营中的高速铁路长度。接下来，构建和训练CNN和反向传播神经网络（BPNN），以在接下来的几年中预测EMU车队规模。深入分析了这两种网络在计算实验中的差异和性能。结果表明，CNN在泛化能力和拟合精度方面均优于BPNN，CNN可以作为EMU舰队规模预测的辅助手段。
