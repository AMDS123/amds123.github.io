##### Abstract
A high-speed multiprocessor architecture for brain-like analyzing information represented in analytic, graph- and table forms of associative relations to search, recognize and make a decision in n-dimensional vector discrete space is offered. Vector-logical process models of actual applications, where the quality of solution is estimated by the proposed integral non-arithmetical metric of the interaction between binary vectors, are described. The theoretical proof of the metric for a vector logical space and the quality criteria for estimating solutions is created.
