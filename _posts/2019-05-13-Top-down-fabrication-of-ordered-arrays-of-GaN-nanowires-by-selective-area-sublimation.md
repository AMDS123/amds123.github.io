##### Abstract
We demonstrate the top-down fabrication of ordered arrays of GaN nanowires by selective area sublimation of pre-patterned GaN(0001) layers grown by hydride vapor phase epitaxy on Al$_{2}$O$_{3}$. Arrays with nanowire diameters and spacings ranging from 50 to 90 nm and 0.1 to 0.7 $\mu$m, respectively, are simultaneously produced under identical conditions. The sublimation process, carried out under high vacuum conditions, is analyzed \emph{in situ} by reflection high-energy electron diffraction and line-of-sight quadrupole mass spectromety. During the sublimation process, the GaN(0001) surface vanishes, giving way to the formation of semi-polar $\lbrace1\bar{1}03\rbrace$ facets which decompose congruently following an Arrhenius temperature dependence with an activation energy of ($3.54 \pm 0.07$) eV and an exponential prefactor of $1.58\times10^{31}$ atoms cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$. The analysis of the samples by low-temperature cathodoluminescence spectroscopy reveals that, in contrast to dry etching, the sublimation process does not introduce nonradiative recombination centers at the nanowire sidewalls. This technique is suitable for the top-down fabrication of a variety of ordered nanostructures, and could possibly be extended to other material systems with similar crystallographic properties such as ZnO.
