##### Abstract
The paper describes the results of the first shared task on word sense induction (WSI) for the Russian language. While similar shared tasks were conducted in the past for some Romance and Germanic languages, we explore the performance of sense induction and disambiguation methods for a Slavic language that shares many features with other Slavic languages, such as rich morphology and free word order. The participants were asked to group contexts with a given word in accordance with its senses that were not provided beforehand. For instance, given a word "bank" and a set of contexts with this word, e.g. "bank is a financial institution that accepts deposits" and "river bank is a slope beside a body of water", a participant was asked to cluster such contexts in the unknown in advance number of clusters corresponding to, in this case, the "company" and the "area" senses of the word "bank". For the purpose of this evaluation campaign, we developed three new evaluation datasets based on sense inventories that have different sense granularity. The contexts in these datasets were sampled from texts of Wikipedia, the academic corpus of Russian, and an explanatory dictionary of Russian. Overall 18 teams participated in the competition submitting 383 models. Multiple teams managed to substantially outperform competitive state-of-the-art baselines from the previous years based on sense embeddings.

##### Abstract (translated by Google)
该论文描述了俄语语言感应感应（WSI）的第一个共同任务的结果。尽管过去对一些浪漫和日耳曼语言进行了类似的共享任务，但我们还是探索了斯拉夫语言的感应归纳和消歧方法的表现，该斯拉夫语言与其他斯拉夫语言共享许多特征，如丰富的形态和自由词序。要求参与者根据事先未提供的感觉将语境与给定单词分组。例如，给定一个单词“银行”以及与该单词相关的一组背景，例如， “银行是接受存款的金融机构”和“河岸是水体旁的斜坡”，参与者被要求将事先未知的情况聚集在相应的群集中，在这种情况下，“公司” “和”地区“意义上的”银行“一词。为了这次评估活动的目的，我们基于具有不同感觉粒度的感觉清单开发了三个新的评估数据集。这些数据集的背景是从维基百科的文本，俄罗斯的学术语料库和俄语的解释词典中抽取的。总共有18支球队参加了提交383个模型的比赛。基于意义嵌入，多个团队设法大大超过了前几年竞争力最强的基准线。
