##### Abstract
This paper introduces a deep learning based classifier for common skin ailments, to help people without easy access to dermatologists. We have confirmed that it can classify at approximately 80% accuracy on average, when primary care doctors are reported to have 53% success as per recent literature. Dermatological diseases are common in every population and have a wide spectrum in severity. With a shortage of dermatological experts being observed in many countries, machine learning solutions can offer timely medical advice regarding existence of common skin diseases. The paper implements supervised classification of nine distinct dermatological diseases which have high occurrence in East Asian countries. Our current attempt establishes that deep learning based techniques are viable avenues for preliminary information.

本文介绍了一种基于深度学习的分类器，用于治疗常见皮肤疾病，帮助人们不容易接触皮肤科医生。我们已经证实，按照最近的文献报道初级保健医生的成功率达到53％时，平均可以以大约80％的准确度进行分类。皮肤病在每个人群中都很常见，并且病情严重。由于许多国家都缺乏皮肤科专家，因此机器学习解决方案可以针对常见皮肤疾病的存在提供及时的医疗建议。本文对东亚国家发病率高的9种皮肤病进行监督分类。我们目前的尝试表明，基于深度学习的技术是初步信息的可行途径。
