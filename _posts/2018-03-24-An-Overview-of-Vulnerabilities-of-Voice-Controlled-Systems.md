##### Abstract
Over the last few years, a rapidly increasing number of Internet-of-Things (IoT) systems that adopt voice as the primary user input have emerged. These systems have been shown to be vulnerable to various types of voice spoofing attacks. However, how exactly these techniques differ or relate to each other has not been extensively studied. In this paper, we provide a survey of recent attack and defense techniques for voice controlled systems and propose a classification of these techniques. We also discuss the need for a universal defense strategy that protects a system from various types of attacks.

在过去几年中，出现了以语音作为主要用户输入的迅速增长的物联网（IoT）系统。这些系统已被证明容易受到各种类型的语音欺骗攻击。然而，这些技术究竟是如何不同或相互关联的，尚未被广泛研究。在本文中，我们提供了对语音控制系统最近的攻击和防御技术的调查，并提出了这些技术的分类。我们还讨论了一种通用防御策略的必要性，该策略可以保护系统免受各种类型的攻击。
