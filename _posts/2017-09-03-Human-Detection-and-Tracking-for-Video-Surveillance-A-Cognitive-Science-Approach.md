##### Abstract
With crimes on the rise all around the world, video surveillance is becoming more important day by day. Due to the lack of human resources to monitor this increasing number of cameras manually new computer vision algorithms to perform lower and higher level tasks are being developed. We have developed a new method incorporating the most acclaimed Histograms of Oriented Gradients the theory of Visual Saliency and the saliency prediction model Deep Multi Level Network to detect human beings in video sequences. Furthermore we implemented the k Means algorithm to cluster the HOG feature vectors of the positively detected windows and determined the path followed by a person in the video. We achieved a detection precision of 83.11% and a recall of 41.27%. We obtained these results 76.866 times faster than classification on normal images.

随着世界各地的犯罪活动日益猖獗，视频监控日益变得日益重要。由于缺乏人力资源来手动监视这一数量不断增加的相机，正在开发新的计算机视觉算法来执行更高级别的任务。我们已经开发了一种新的方法，其中包括最受好评的直方图的倾斜梯度的视觉显着性理论和显着性预测模型深度多级网络检测人类的视频序列。此外，我们实现了k Means算法来对正检测窗口的HOG特征向量进行聚类，并确定了视频中某个人的路径。检出率达到83.11％，召回率达到41.27％。我们获得这些结果比正常图像上的分类快76.866倍。
