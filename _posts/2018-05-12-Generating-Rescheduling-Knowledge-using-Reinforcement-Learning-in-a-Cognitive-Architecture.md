##### Abstract
In order to reach higher degrees of flexibility, adaptability and autonomy in manufacturing systems, it is essential to develop new rescheduling methodologies which resort to cognitive capabilities, similar to those found in human beings. Artificial cognition is important for designing planning and control systems that generate and represent knowledge about heuristics for repair-based scheduling. Rescheduling knowledge in the form of decision rules is used to deal with unforeseen events and disturbances reactively in real time, and take advantage of the ability to act interactively with the user to counteract the effects of disruptions. In this work, to achieve the aforementioned goals, a novel approach to generate rescheduling knowledge in the form of dynamic first-order logical rules is proposed. The proposed approach is based on the integration of reinforcement learning with artificial cognitive capabilities involving perception and reasoning/learning skills embedded in the Soar cognitive architecture. An industrial example is discussed showing that the approach enables the scheduling system to assess its operational range in an autonomic way, and to acquire experience through intensive simulation while performing repair tasks.

为了在制造系统中达到更高程度的灵活性，适应性和自主性，重要的是开发新的重新调度方法，这些方法采用类似于人类的认知能力。人工认知对设计规划和控制系统非常重要，这些系统可以生成和表示关于基于修理的调度的启发式知识。以决策规则的形式重新安排知识用于实时处理不可预见的事件和干扰，并利用与用户交互行动的能力来抵消干扰的影响。在这项工作中，为了实现上述目标，提出了一种以动态一阶逻辑规则的形式生成重新调度知识的新方法。所提出的方法基于将强化学习与人工认知能力相结合，所述人工认知能力包括嵌入在Soar认知架构中的感知和推理/学习技能。我们讨论了一个工业示例，显示该方法使调度系统能够以自主方式评估其操作范围，并在执行修复任务时通过密集模拟获取经验。
