##### Abstract
Emotion being a subjective thing, leveraging knowledge and science behind labeled data and extracting the components that constitute it, has been a challenging problem in the industry for many years. With the evolution of deep learning in computer vision, emotion recognition has become a widely-tackled research problem. In this work, we propose two independent methods for this very task. The first method uses autoencoders to construct a unique representation of each emotion, while the second method is an 8-layer convolutional neural network (CNN). These methods were trained on the posed-emotion dataset (JAFFE), and to test their robustness, both the models were also tested on 100 random images from the Labeled Faces in the Wild (LFW) dataset, which consists of images that are candid than posed. The results show that with more fine-tuning and depth, our CNN model can outperform the state-of-the-art methods for emotion recognition. We also propose some exciting ideas for expanding the concept of representational autoencoders to improve their performance.

情感是一种主观的东西，利用标记数据的知识和科学以及提取构成它的组成部分，已经成为业界多年来的一个具有挑战性的问题。随着计算机视觉深度学习的发展，情感识别已经成为一个广泛研究的问题。在这项工作中，我们为这个任务提出了两个独立的方法。第一种方法是使用自编码器来构造每种情绪的唯一表示，而第二种方法是8层卷积神经网络（CNN）。这些方法在姿势情绪数据集（JAFFE）上训练，为了测试它们的鲁棒性，两个模型还在来自野生标记的面部（LFW）数据集的100个随机图像上进行测试，所述图像包括比构成。结果表明，CNN模型具有更多的微调和深度，可以超越最先进的情感识别方法。我们还提出了一些令人兴奋的想法来扩展代表性自动编码器的概念，以提高其性能。
