##### Abstract
In this paper we present a theoretical study of a specific class of vibration-driven robots: the brushbots. In a bottom-up fashion, we start by improving the state-of-the-art dynamic models of the brush-based locomotion mechanism. Then, we discuss the range of validity of these models and their applicability to different types of brushbots which can be found in literature. Finally, we present two designs of brushbots: a fully-actuated platform and a differential-drive-like one. These two designs are used to experimentally validate both the developed theoretical models and the devised motion control algorithms.
