##### Abstract
Deep convolutional neural networks (CNN) have recently been shown to generate promising results for aesthetics assessment. However, the performance of these deep CNN methods is often compromised by the constraint that the neural network only takes the fixed-size input. To accommodate this requirement, input images need to be transformed via cropping, warping, or padding, which often alter image composition, reduce image resolution, or cause image distortion. Thus the aesthetics of the original images is impaired because of potential loss of fine grained details and holistic image layout. However, such fine grained details and holistic image layout is critical for evaluating an image's aesthetics. In this paper, we present an Adaptive Layout-Aware Multi-Patch Convolutional Neural Network (A-Lamp CNN) architecture for photo aesthetic assessment. This novel scheme is able to accept arbitrary sized images, and learn from both fined grained details and holistic image layout simultaneously. To enable training on these hybrid inputs, we extend the method by developing a dedicated double-subnet neural network structure, i.e. a Multi-Patch subnet and a Layout-Aware subnet. We further construct an aggregation layer to effectively combine the hybrid features from these two subnets. Extensive experiments on the large-scale aesthetics assessment benchmark (AVA) demonstrate significant performance improvement over the state-of-the-art in photo aesthetic assessment.

深度卷积神经网络（CNN）最近已被证明为美学评估产生了有希望的结果。然而，这些深度CNN方法的性能往往受到神经网络仅采用固定尺寸输入的约束的影响。为了适应这种需求，输入图像需要通过裁剪，变形或填充进行转换，这往往会改变图像的组成，降低图像的分辨率，或导致图像失真。因此，原始图像的美感由于细节细节和整体图像布局的潜在损失而受到损害。然而，这样细致的细节和整体的图像布局对评估图像的美学至关重要。在本文中，我们提出了一个自适应布局感知多片卷积神经网络（A灯CNN）架构的照片审美评估。这种新颖的方案能够接受任意大小的图像，同时学习细粒度细节和整体图像布局。为了对这些混合输入进行训练，我们通过开发一个专用的双子网神经网络结构来扩展这个方法，即一个Multi-Patch子网和一个Layout-Aware子网。我们进一步构建一个聚合层来有效地结合这两个子网的混合特性。大规模美学评估基准（AVA）的大量实验表明，相对于最新的照片美学评估，其性能有了显着的提高。
