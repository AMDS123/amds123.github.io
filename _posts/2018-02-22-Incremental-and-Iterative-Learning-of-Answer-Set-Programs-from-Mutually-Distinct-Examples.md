##### Abstract
Over these years the Artificial Intelligence (AI) community has produced several datasets which have given the machine learning algorithms the opportunity to learn various skills across various domains. However, a subclass of these machine learning algorithms that aimed at learning logic programs, namely the Inductive Logic Programming algorithms, have often failed at the task due to the vastness of these datasets. This has impacted the usability of knowledge representation and reasoning techniques in the development of AI systems. In this research, we try to address this scalability issue for the algorithms that learn Answer Set Programs. We present a sound and complete algorithm which takes the input in a slightly different manner and perform an efficient and more user controlled search for a solution. We show via experiments that our algorithm can learn from two popular datasets from machine learning community, namely bAbl (a question answering dataset) and MNIST (a dataset for handwritten digit recognition), which to the best of our knowledge was not previously possible. The system is publicly available at https://goo.gl/KdWAcV.

这些年来，人工智能（AI）社区已经制作了多个数据集，这些数据集为机器学习算法提供了学习各个领域各种技能的机会。然而，这些机器学习算法的一个子类，目的在于学习逻辑程序，即归纳逻辑编程算法，由于这些数据集的庞大程度，往往在任务上失败。这影响了AI系统开发中知识表示和推理技术的可用性。在这项研究中，我们尝试解决学习答案集程序的算法的这种可伸缩性问题。我们提出了一个完善而完整的算法，它以稍微不同的方式输入输入，并执行高效且用户更易控制的解决方案搜索。我们通过实验显示，我们的算法可以从机器学习社区的两个流行数据集中学习，即bAbl（问题回答数据集）和MNIST（手写数字识别数据集），据我们所知，这是以前无法实现的。该系统可在https://goo.gl/KdWAcV上公开获取。
