##### Abstract
Random Forest (RF) is a successful paradigm for learning classifiers due to its ability to learn from large feature spaces and seamlessly integrate multi-class classification, as well as the achieved accuracy and processing efficiency. However, as many other classifiers, RF requires domain adaptation (DA) provided that there is a mismatch between the training (source) and testing (target) domains which provokes classification degradation. Consequently, different RF-DA methods have been proposed, which not only require target-domain samples but revisiting the source-domain ones, too. As novelty, we propose three inherently different methods (Node-Adapt, Path-Adapt and Tree-Adapt) that only require the learned source-domain RF and a relatively few target-domain samples for DA, i.e. source-domain samples do not need to be available. To assess the performance of our proposals we focus on image-based object detection, using the pedestrian detection problem as challenging proof-of-concept. Moreover, we use the RF with expert nodes because it is a competitive patch-based pedestrian model. We test our Node-, Path- and Tree-Adapt methods in standard benchmarks, showing that DA is largely achieved.

随机森林（RF）是学习分类器的成功典范，因为它能够从大的特征空间中学习，并能够无缝集成多类分类以及实现的准确性和处理效率。然而，与其他许多分类器一样，如果训练（源）和测试（目标）域之间存在引起分类降级的不匹配，则RF需要域适应（DA）。因此，已经提出了不同的RF-DA方法，其不仅要求目标域样本，还要重新考虑源域样本。作为新颖性，我们提出了三种天生不同的方法（Node-Adapt，Path-Adapt和Tree-Adapt），只需要学习源域RF和相对较少的DA目标域采样，即源域采样不需要可用。为了评估我们的建议的性能，我们专注于基于图像的物体检测，使用行人检测问题作为具有挑战性的概念验证。此外，我们使用射频与专家节点，因为它是一个竞争补丁为基础的行人模型。我们在标准的基准测试中测试了我们的Node-，Path-和Tree-Adapt方法，显示DA在很大程度上已经实现了。
