##### Abstract
We search for frozen water and its processing around young stellar objects (YSOs of class I/II). We try to detect potential, regional differences in water ice evolution within YSOs, which is relevant to understanding the chemical structure of the progenitors of protoplanetary systems and the evolution of solid materials. Water plays an important role as a reaction bed for rich chemistry and is an indispensable requirement for life as known on Earth. We present our analysis of NAOS-CONICA/VLT spectroscopy of water ice at 3um for the TTauri star YLW 16A in the rho-Ophiuchi molecular cloud. We obtained spectra for different regions of the circumstellar environment. The observed absorption profiles are deconvolved with the mass extinction profiles of amorphous and crystallized ice measured in laboratory. We take into account both absorption and scattering by ice grains. Water ice in YLW 16A is detected with optical depths of between tau=1.8 and tau=2.5. The profiles that are measured can be fitted predominantly by the extinction profiles of small grains (0.1um - 0.3um) with a small contribution from large grains (<10%). However, an unambiguous trace of grain growth cannot be found. We detected crystallized water ice spectra that have their origin in different regions of the circumstellar environment of the TTauri star YLW 16A. The crystallinity increases in the upper layers of the circumstellar disk, while only amorphous grains exist in the bipolar envelope. As in studies of silicate grains in TTauri objects, the higher crystallinity in the upper layers of the outer disk regions implies that water ice crystallizes and remains crystallized close to the disk atmosphere where water ice is shielded against hard irradiation.

我们搜索冷冻水及其周围年轻恒星物体（I / II级YSOs）的处理。我们尝试探测YSOs内水冰演化的潜在区域差异，这与理解原行星系祖细胞的化学结构和固体物质的演化有关。水作为丰富的化学反应床起着重要的作用，是地球上已知的生命不可或缺的要求。我们在rho-Ophiuchi分子云中展示了我们对3um的水冰的NAOS-CONICA / VLT光谱的分析。我们获得了星周环境不同区域的光谱。观察到的吸收曲线与实验室测量的非晶态和结晶冰的质量消光曲线相反。我们考虑冰粒的吸收和散射。在YLW 16A中的水冰被检测到在tau = 1.8和tau = 2.5之间的光学深度。测得的剖面主要由小颗粒（0.1um  -  0.3um）的消光剖面和大颗粒（<10％）的少量贡献拟合。但是，没有发现明确的晶粒生长痕迹。我们检测到了结晶水冰的光谱，它们起源于TTauri星YLW 16A的星周环境的不同区域。星周盘上层的结晶度增加，而双极包层中仅存在非晶粒。正如对TTauri物体中硅酸盐颗粒的研究，外部盘区上层的较高结晶度意味着水冰结晶并保持结晶接近盘冰环境，在该环境中水冰被硬屏蔽。
