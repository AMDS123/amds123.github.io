##### Abstract
The past several years have witnessed the rapid progress of end-to-end Neural Machine Translation (NMT). However, there exists discrepancy between training and inference in NMT when decoding, which may lead to serious problems since the model might be in a part of the state space it has never seen during training. To address the issue, Scheduled Sampling has been proposed. However, there are certain limitations in Scheduled Sampling and we propose two dynamic oracle-based methods to improve it. We manage to mitigate the discrepancy by changing the training process towards a less guided scheme and meanwhile aggregating the oracle's demonstrations. Experimental results show that the proposed approaches improve translation quality over standard NMT system.

近几年来，端到端的神经机器翻译（NMT）迅速发展。然而，在解码时NMT中的训练和推理之间存在差异，这可能导致严重的问题，因为该模型可能处于训练中从未看到的状态空间的一部分。为了解决这个问题，已经提出了定期采样。然而，在计划抽样中存在一定的局限性，我们提出了两种基于动态的基于Oracle的方法来改进它。我们通过把训练过程转向一个较少指导的方案，同时聚合神谕的示范，来设法减少差异。实验结果表明，提出的方法提高了标准NMT系统的翻译质量。
