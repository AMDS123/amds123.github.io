##### Abstract
Tang (618-907 AD) and Song (960-1279) dynasties are two very important periods in the development of Chinese literary. The most influential forms of the poetry in Tang and Song were Shi and Ci, respectively. Tang Shi and Song Ci established crucial foundations of the Chinese literature, and their influences in both literary works and daily lives of the Chinese communities last until today. We can analyze and compare the Complete Tang Shi and the Complete Song Ci from various viewpoints. In this presentation, we report our findings about the differences in their vocabularies. Interesting new words that started to appear in Song Ci and continue to be used in modern Chinese were identified. Colors are an important ingredient of the imagery in poetry, and we discuss the most frequent color words that appeared in Tang Shi and Song Ci.

##### Abstract (translated by Google)
公元618〜907年，宋代（960〜1279年）是中国文学发展的两个非常重要的时期。唐宋诗歌中最有影响的形式是“诗”和“词”。唐诗和宋词创立了中国文学的重要基础，直到今天，它们在中国社会的文学作品和日常生活中都受到了影响。我们可以从各个角度分析和比较“完整的唐诗”和“完整的宋词”。在这个演讲中，我们汇报了他们词汇中差异的发现。确定了在宋词中出现并继续用于现代汉语的有趣的新词。色彩是诗歌意象的重要组成部分，我们讨论唐诗和宋词中最常见的色彩词。
