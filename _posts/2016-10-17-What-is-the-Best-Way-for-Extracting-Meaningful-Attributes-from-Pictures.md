##### Abstract
Automatic attribute discovery methods have gained in popularity to extract sets of visual attributes from images or videos for various tasks. Despite their good performance in some classification tasks, it is difficult to evaluate whether the attributes discovered by these methods are meaningful and which methods are the most appropriate to discover attributes for visual descriptions. In its simplest form, such an evaluation can be performed by manually verifying whether there is any consistent identifiable visual concept distinguishing between positive and negative exemplars labelled by an attribute. This manual checking is tedious, expensive and labour intensive. In addition, comparisons between different methods could also be problematic as it is not clear how one could quantitatively decide which attribute is more meaningful than the others. In this paper, we propose a novel attribute meaningfulness metric to address this challenging problem. With this metric, automatic quantitative evaluation can be performed on the attribute sets; thus, reducing the enormous effort to perform manual evaluation. The proposed metric is applied to some recent automatic attribute discovery and hashing methods on four attribute-labelled datasets. To further validate the efficacy of the proposed method, we conducted a user study. In addition, we also compared our metric with a semi-supervised attribute discover method using the mixture of probabilistic PCA. In our evaluation, we gleaned several insights that could be beneficial in developing new automatic attribute discovery methods.

自动属性发现方法越来越受欢迎，以从各种任务的图像或视频中提取视觉属性组。尽管在一些分类任务中表现良好，但是很难评估这些方法发现的属性是否有意义，哪些方法最适合于发现视觉描述的属性。在其最简单的形式中，可以通过手动验证是否存在区分由属性标记的正面和负面范例的任何一致的可识别视觉概念来执行这样的评估。手动检查是繁琐，昂贵和劳动密集型的。此外，不同方法之间的比较也可能是有问题的，因为不清楚如何能够定量地确定哪个属性比其他属性更有意义。在本文中，我们提出了一个新的属性意义度量来解决这个具有挑战性的问题。通过这个度量，可以对属性集执行自动定量评估;从而减少了进行人工评估的巨大努力。所提出的度量被应用于一些最近在四个属性标记的数据集上的自动属性发现和哈希方法。为了进一步验证所提出的方法的有效性，我们进行了用户研究。此外，我们还将我们的度量与使用概率PCA混合的半监督属性发现方法进行了比较。在我们的评估中，我们收集了一些有助于开发新的自动属性发现方法的见解。
