##### Abstract
Over the last decade, the process of automatic colorization had been studied thoroughly due to its vast application such as colorization of grayscale images and restoration of aged and/or degraded images. This problem is highly ill-posed due to the extremely large degrees of freedom during the assignment of color information. Many of the recent developments in automatic colorization involved images that contained a common theme throughout training, and/or required highly processed data such as semantic maps as input data. In our approach, we attempted to fully generalize this procedure using a conditional Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Network (DCGAN). The network is trained over datasets that are publicly available such as CIFAR-10 and Places365. The results of the generative model and tradition deep neural networks are compared.

在过去的十年中，由于其广泛的应用，如灰度图像的彩色化和老化和/或退化图像的恢复，自动着色的过程已经被彻底研究。由于颜色信息分配过程中的自由度非常大，因此这个问题非常不恰当。自动彩色化的近期发展包括在整个培训期间包含共同主题的图像，和/或需要高度处理的数据（如语义地图）作为输入数据。在我们的方法中，我们试图使用有条件的深度卷积生成对抗网络（DCGAN）完全概括这个过程。该网络通过公开可用的数据集进行培训，如CIFAR-10和Places365。比较生成模型和传统深层神经网络的结果。
