##### Abstract
This work presents a novel objective function for the unsupervised training of neural network sentence encoders. It exploits signals from paragraph-level discourse coherence to train these models to understand text. Our objective is purely discriminative, allowing us to train models many times faster than was possible under prior methods, and it yields models which perform well in extrinsic evaluations.

本文为神经网络句子编码器的无监督训练提供了一个新的目标函数。它利用段落级别话语连贯的信号来训练这些模型来理解文本。我们的目标是纯粹的区分性，使我们能够比以前的方法更快速地训练模型，并且产生在外部评估中表现良好的模型。
