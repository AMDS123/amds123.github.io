##### Abstract
Purpose: To present a new fast and reliable application for iPad (ST) for screening stereopsis at multiple distances. Methods: A new iPad application (app) based on a random dot stereogram was designed for screening stereopsis at multiple distances. Sixty-five subjects with no ocular diseases and wearing their habitual correction were tested at two different distances: 3 m and at 0.4 m. Results were compared with other commercial tests: TNO (at near) and Howard Dolman (at distance) Subjects were cited one week later in order to repeat the same procedures for assessing reproducibility of the tests. Results: Stereopsis at near was better with ST (40 arcsec) than with TNO (60 arcsec), but not significantly (p = 0.36). The agreement was good (k = 0.604) and the reproducibility was better with ST (k = 0.801) than with TNO (k = 0.715), in fact median difference between days was significant only with TNO (p = 0.02). On the other hand, poor agreement was obtained between HD and ST at far distance (k=0.04), obtaining significant differences in medians (p = 0.001) and poorer reliability with HD (k = 0.374) than with ST (k = 0.502). Conclusions: Screening stereopsis at near with a new iPad app demonstrated to be a fast and realiable. Results were in a good agreement with conventional tests as TNO, but it could not be compared at far vision with HD due to the limited resolution of the iPad.

目的：提供一个新的快速和可靠的应用程序的iPad（ST）在多个距离筛选立体视觉。方法：基于随机点立体图的新iPad应用程序（app）被设计用于在多个距离处筛选立体视觉。 65名没有眼部疾病并习惯性矫正的受试者在两个不同的距离处测试：3米和0.4米。将结果与其他商业测试进行比较：TNO（近）和Howard Dolman（远距离）受试者在一周后被引用以重复相同的程序以评估测试的重现性。结果：ST段（40弧秒）与TNO（60弧秒）相比，近视立体视为更好，但不显着（p = 0.36）。该协议是好的（k = 0.604），ST（k = 0.801）的重复性好于TNO（k = 0.715），实际上中间差异只有TNO（p = 0.02）。另一方面，HD与ST之间在远距离（k = 0.04）差异显着，中位数差异显着（p = 0.001），HD差异可信度（k = 0.374）显着低于ST（k = 0.502） 。结论：用新的iPad应用程序在近处进行立体视图显示是一个快速和可靠的。结果与TNO的传统测试有很好的一致性，但由于iPad的分辨率有限，无法与远景视频进行比较。
