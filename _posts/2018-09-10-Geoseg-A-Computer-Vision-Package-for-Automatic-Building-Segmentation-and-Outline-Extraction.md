##### Abstract
Recently, deep learning algorithms, especially fully convolutional network based methods, are becoming very popular in the field of remote sensing. However, these methods are implemented and evaluated through various datasets and deep learning frameworks. There has not been a package that covers these methods in a unifying manner. In this study, we introduce a computer vision package termed Geoseg that focus on building segmentation and outline extraction. Geoseg implements over nine state-of-the-art models as well as utility scripts needed to conduct model training, logging, evaluating and visualization. The implementation of Geoseg emphasizes unification, simplicity, and flexibility. The performance and computational efficiency of all implemented methods are evaluated by comparison experiment through a unified, high-quality aerial image dataset.

##### Abstract (translated by Google)
最近，深度学习算法，尤其是完全基于卷积网络的方法，在遥感领域变得非常流行。但是，这些方法是通过各种数据集和深度学习框架实施和评估的。没有一个包以统一的方式涵盖这些方法。在这项研究中，我们引入了一个名为Geoseg的计算机视觉包，专注于构建分割和轮廓提取。 Geoseg实施了九个最先进的模型以及进行模型培训，记录，评估和可视化所需的实用程序脚本。 Geoseg的实施强调统一性，简单性和灵活性。通过比较实验，通过统一的高质量航空图像数据集评估所有实施方法的性能和计算效率。
