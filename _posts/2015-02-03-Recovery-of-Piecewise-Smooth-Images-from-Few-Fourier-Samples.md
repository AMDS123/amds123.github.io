##### Abstract
We introduce a Prony-like method to recover a continuous domain 2-D piecewise smooth image from few of its Fourier samples. Assuming the discontinuity set of the image is localized to the zero level-set of a trigonometric polynomial, we show the Fourier transform coefficients of partial derivatives of the signal satisfy an annihilation relation. We present necessary and sufficient conditions for unique recovery of piecewise constant images using the above annihilation relation. We pose the recovery of the Fourier coefficients of the signal from the measurements as a convex matrix completion algorithm, which relies on the lifting of the Fourier data to a structured low-rank matrix; this approach jointly estimates the signal and the annihilating filter. Finally, we demonstrate our algorithm on the recovery of MRI phantoms from few low-resolution Fourier samples.

我们引入一种类Prony方法来从几个傅立叶样本中恢复一个连续域的二维分段光滑图像。假设图像的不连续性集合局限于三角多项式的零水平集，我们展示信号的偏导数的傅立叶变换系数满足湮没关系。我们给出了使用上述湮没关系独立恢复分段恒定图像的充分必要条件。我们将来自测量的信号的傅里叶系数恢复为凸矩阵完成算法，该算法依赖于将傅立叶数据提升到结构化的低秩矩阵;这种方法联合估计信号和湮没滤波器。最后，我们演示了我们从少量低分辨率傅立叶样本恢复MRI幻像的算法。
