##### Abstract
Integration between biology and information science benefits both fields. Many related models have been proposed, such as computational visual cognition models, computational motor control models, integrations of both and so on. In general, the robustness and precision of recognition is one of the key problems for object recognition models. In this paper, inspired by features of human recognition process and their biological mechanisms, a new integrated and dynamic framework is proposed to mimic the semantic extraction, concept formation and feature re-selection in human visual processing. The main contributions of the proposed model are as follows: (1) Semantic feature extraction: Local semantic features are learnt from episodic features that are extracted from raw images through a deep neural network; (2) Integrated concept formation: Concepts are formed with local semantic information and structural information learnt through network. (3) Feature re-selection: When ambiguity is detected during recognition process, distinctive features according to the difference between ambiguous candidates are re-selected for recognition. Experimental results on hand-written digits and facial shape dataset show that, compared with other methods, the new proposed model exhibits higher robustness and precision for visual recognition, especially in the condition when input samples are smantic ambiguous. Meanwhile, the introduced biological mechanisms further strengthen the interaction between neuroscience and information science.

生物学与信息科学的整合对两个领域都有利。已经提出了许多相关的模型，如计算机视觉认知模型，计算机控制模型，两者的整合等。一般来说，识别的鲁棒性和精度是物体识别模型的关键问题之一。本文从人类识别过程的特点及其生物学机制出发，提出了一种新的综合动态框架，模拟人类视觉处理中的语义提取，概念形成和特征重选。该模型的主要贡献如下：（1）语义特征提取：通过深度神经网络从原始图像中提取的情景特征中学习局部语义特征; （2）一体化的概念形成：​​通过网络学习本地语义信息和结构化信息，形成概念。 （3）特征重选：在识别过程中检测到模糊性时，根据模糊候选者之间的差异重新选择识别特征。手写数字和面部形状数据集的实验结果表明，与其他方法相比，新提出的模型对于视觉识别具有较高的鲁棒性和精确度，特别是在输入样本模糊不清的情况下。同时，引入的生物机制进一步加强了神经科学与信息科学的相互作用。
