##### Abstract
Generative Adversarial Networks(GAN) gets wide attention in machine learning field because of its massive potential to learn high dimensional, complex real data. Specifically, it does not need to do further distribution assumption and can simply infer real-like samples from latent space. This powerful property leads GAN to be applied various applications such as image synthesis, image attribute editing, image translation, domain adaptation and even to other academic fields. In this review paper, we aim to look into details of GAN. We discuss how GAN operates and fundamental meaning of various objective functions suggested. Then, we focus on how GAN can be combined with auto encoder framework which makes possible latent space to be managed. As an extension, we also point to GAN variants which are applied to various amount of tasks and other fields.

##### Abstract (translated by Google)
生成对抗网络（GAN）在机器学习领域受到广泛关注，因为它具有学习高维，复杂实际数据的巨大潜力。具体而言，它不需要做进一步的分布假设，并且可以简单地从潜在的空间推断真实样本。这一强大的属性使得GAN可以应用于图像合成，图像属性编辑，图像翻译，领域适应等各种应用，甚至应用于其他学术领域。在这篇评论文章中，我们的目标是研究GAN的细节。我们讨论GAN如何运作，并提出各种目标函数的基本含义。然后，我们着重介绍如何将GAN与自动编码器框架相结合，从而使潜在的空间得到管理。作为一个扩展，我们也指出了适用于各种任务和其他领域的GAN变体。
