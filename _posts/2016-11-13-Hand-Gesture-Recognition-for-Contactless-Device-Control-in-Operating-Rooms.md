##### Abstract
Hand gesture is one of the most important means of touchless communication between human and machines. There is a great interest for commanding electronic equipment in surgery rooms by hand gesture for reducing the time of surgery and the potential for infection. There are challenges in implementation of a hand gesture recognition system. It has to fulfill requirements such as high accuracy and fast response. In this paper we introduce a system of hand gesture recognition based on a deep learning approach. Deep learning is known as an accurate detection model, but its high complexity prevents it from being fabricated as an embedded system. To cope with this problem, we applied some changes in the structure of our work to achieve low complexity. As a result, the proposed method could be implemented on a naive embedded system. Our experiments show that the proposed system results in higher accuracy while having less complexity in comparison with the existing comparable methods.

手势是人机之间非接触式通讯的重要手段之一。在手术室内通过手势指挥电子设备对减少手术时间和感染的可能性有很大的兴趣。在实现手势识别系统方面存在挑战。它必须满足高精度和快速响应的要求。在本文中，我们介绍一种基于深度学习方法的手势识别系统。深度学习被称为精确的检测模型，但其高度复杂性使其不能作为嵌入式系统进行制造。为了解决这个问题，我们在工作结构上做了一些改变，以实现低复杂性。因此，该方法可以在一个朴素的嵌入式系统上实现。我们的实验表明，与现有的可比较方法相比，所提出的系统具有更高的准确性，同时复杂度更低。
