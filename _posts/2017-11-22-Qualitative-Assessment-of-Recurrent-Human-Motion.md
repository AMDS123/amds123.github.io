##### Abstract
Smartphone applications designed to track human motion in combination with wearable sensors, e.g., during physical exercising, raised huge attention recently. Commonly, they provide quantitative services, such as personalized training instructions or the counting of distances. But qualitative monitoring and assessment is still missing, e.g., to detect malpositions, to prevent injuries, or to optimize training success. We address this issue by presenting a concept for qualitative as well as generic assessment of recurrent human motion by processing multi-dimensional, continuous time series tracked with motion sensors. Therefore, our segmentation procedure extracts individual events of specific length and we propose expressive features to accomplish a qualitative motion assessment by supervised classification. We verified our approach within a comprehensive study encompassing 27 athletes undertaking different body weight exercises. We are able to recognize six different exercise types with a success rate of 100% and to assess them qualitatively with an average success rate of 99.3%.

旨在跟踪可穿戴传感器（例如在体育锻炼期间）跟踪人体运动的智能手机应用近来引起了巨大的关注。他们通常提供量化的服务，如个性化的培训指导或距离计数。但是定性监测和评估仍然缺失，例如检测错位，防止受伤或优化培训成功。我们通过处理运动传感器跟踪的多维连续时间序列，提出一个定性和常规人体运动复杂性评估的概念来解决这个问题。因此，我们的分割过程提取具体长度的个别事件，我们提出了表达的特征，通过监督分类完成定性运动评估。我们在一项综合研究中验证了我们的方法，包括27名运动员进行不同的体重锻炼。我们能够识别6种不同的运动类型，成功率为100％，定性评估，平均成功率为99.3％。
