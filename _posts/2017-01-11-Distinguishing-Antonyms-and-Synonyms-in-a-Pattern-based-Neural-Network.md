##### Abstract
Distinguishing between antonyms and synonyms is a key task to achieve high performance in NLP systems. While they are notoriously difficult to distinguish by distributional co-occurrence models, pattern-based methods have proven effective to differentiate between the relations. In this paper, we present a novel neural network model AntSynNET that exploits lexico-syntactic patterns from syntactic parse trees. In addition to the lexical and syntactic information, we successfully integrate the distance between the related words along the syntactic path as a new pattern feature. The results from classification experiments show that AntSynNET improves the performance over prior pattern-based methods.

区分反义词和同义词是实现NLP系统高性能的关键任务。尽管众所周知，分布式共现模型难以区分，但基于模式的方法已被证明是有效区分这些关系的。在本文中，我们提出了一个新的神经网络模型AntSynNET，它利用句法分析树中的词汇语法模式。除了词汇和句法信息之外，我们成功地将相关词语之间的距离作为一种新的模式特征，沿着句法路径进行整合。分类实验的结果表明，AntSynNET比之前基于模式的方法提高了性能。
