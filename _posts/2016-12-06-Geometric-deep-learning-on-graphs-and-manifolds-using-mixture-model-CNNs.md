##### Abstract
Deep learning has achieved a remarkable performance breakthrough in several fields, most notably in speech recognition, natural language processing, and computer vision. In particular, convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures currently produce state-of-the-art performance on a variety of image analysis tasks such as object detection and recognition. Most of deep learning research has so far focused on dealing with 1D, 2D, or 3D Euclidean-structured data such as acoustic signals, images, or videos. Recently, there has been an increasing interest in geometric deep learning, attempting to generalize deep learning methods to non-Euclidean structured data such as graphs and manifolds, with a variety of applications from the domains of network analysis, computational social science, or computer graphics. In this paper, we propose a unified framework allowing to generalize CNN architectures to non-Euclidean domains (graphs and manifolds) and learn local, stationary, and compositional task-specific features. We show that various non-Euclidean CNN methods previously proposed in the literature can be considered as particular instances of our framework. We test the proposed method on standard tasks from the realms of image-, graph- and 3D shape analysis and show that it consistently outperforms previous approaches.

深度学习在几个领域取得了显着的性能突破，最显着的是语音识别，自然语言处理和计算机视觉。具体而言，卷积神经网络（CNN）架构目前在诸如物体检测和识别等各种图像分析任务上产生了最先进的性能。迄今为止，大多数深度学习研究都集中在处理一维，二维或三维欧氏结构化数据，如声音信号，图像或视频。近来，人们对几何深度学习的兴趣日益增加，试图将深度学习方法推广到非欧几里德结构化数据，如图和流形，其中来自网络分析，计算社会科学或计算机图形领域的各种应用。在本文中，我们提出了一个统一的框架，允许将CNN体系结构推广到非欧几里德域（图和流形），并学习局部，固定和组合任务特定的特征。我们表明，文献中先前提出的各种非欧几里得CNN方法可以被认为是我们框架的特定实例。我们从图像，图形和三维形状分析的领域测试标准任务提出的方法，并表明它一直胜过以前的方法。
