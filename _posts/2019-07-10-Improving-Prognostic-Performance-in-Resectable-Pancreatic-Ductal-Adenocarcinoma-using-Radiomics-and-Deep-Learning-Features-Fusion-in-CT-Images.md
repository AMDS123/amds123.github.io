##### Abstract
As an analytic pipeline for quantitative imaging feature extraction and analysis, radiomics has grown rapidly in the past a few years. Recent studies in radiomics aim to investigate the relationship between tumors imaging features and clinical outcomes. Open source radiomics feature banks enable the extraction and analysis of thousands of predefined features. On the other hand, recent advances in deep learning have shown significant potential in the quantitative medical imaging field, raising the research question of whether predefined radiomics features have predictive information in addition to deep learning features. In this study, we propose a feature fusion method and investigate whether a combined feature bank of deep learning and predefined radiomics features can improve the prognostics performance. CT images from resectable Pancreatic Adenocarcinoma (PDAC) patients were used to compare the prognosis performance of common feature reduction and fusion methods and the proposed risk-score based feature fusion method for overall survival. It was shown that the proposed feature fusion method significantly improves the prognosis performance for overall survival in resectable PDAC cohorts, elevating the area under ROC curve by 51% compared to predefined radiomics features alone, by 16% compared to deep learning features alone, and by 32% compared to existing feature fusion and reduction methods for a combination of deep learning and predefined radiomics features.
