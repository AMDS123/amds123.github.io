##### Abstract
With the advancement of research in word sense disambiguation and deep learning, large sense-annotated datasets are increasingly important for training supervised systems. However, gathering high-quality sense-annotated data for as many instances as possible is an arduous task. This has led to the proliferation of automatic and semi-automatic methods for overcoming the so-called knowledge-acquisition bottleneck. In this paper we present an overview of currently available sense-annotated corpora, both manually and automatically constructed, for various languages and resources (i.e. WordNet, Wikipedia, BabelNet). General statistics and specific features of each sense-annotated dataset are also provided.

##### Abstract (translated by Google)
随着词义消歧和深度学习研究的进展，大量的感知注释数据集对训练监督系统越来越重要。然而，为尽可能多的实例收集高质量的感知注释数据是一项艰巨的任务。这导致了克服所谓知识获取瓶颈的自动和半自动方法的激增。在本文中，我们提供了对于各种语言和资源（即WordNet，维基百科，BabelNet）的当前可用的感知注释的语料库（手动和自动构建）的概述。还提供了每个感知批注数据集的一般统计数据和特定功能。
