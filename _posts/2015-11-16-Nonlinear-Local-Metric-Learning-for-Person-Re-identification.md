##### Abstract
Person re-identification aims at matching pedestrians observed from non-overlapping camera views. Feature descriptor and metric learning are two significant problems in person re-identification. A discriminative metric learning method should be capable of exploiting complex nonlinear transformations due to the large variations in feature space. In this paper, we propose a nonlinear local metric learning (NLML) method to improve the state-of-the-art performance of person re-identification on public datasets. Motivated by the fact that local metric learning has been introduced to handle the data which varies locally and deep neural network has presented outstanding capability in exploiting the nonlinearity of samples, we utilize the merits of both local metric learning and deep neural network to learn multiple sets of nonlinear transformations. By enforcing a margin between the distances of positive pedestrian image pairs and distances of negative pairs in the transformed feature subspace, discriminative information can be effectively exploited in the developed neural networks. Our experiments show that the proposed NLML method achieves the state-of-the-art results on the widely used VIPeR, GRID, and CUHK 01 datasets.

人员重新识别旨在匹配从不重叠摄像机视图观察到的行人。特征描述符和度量学习是人重新识别中的两个重要问题。鉴别度量学习方法应该能够利用复杂的非线性变换由于特征空间的巨大变化。在本文中，我们提出了一种非线性局部度量学习（NLML）方法来提高公共数据集上人物重新识别的最新性能。受局部度量学习引入处理局部变化的数据和深层神经网络在挖掘样本非线性方面表现出色的能力的推动下，利用局部度量学习和深度神经网络的优点，非线性变换。通过在变换后的特征子空间中增加正行人图像对的距离和负对的距离之间的差值，可以在开发的神经网络中有效地利用判别信息。我们的实验表明，所提出的NLML方法在广泛使用的VIPeR，GRID和CUHK 01数据集上达到了最新的结果。
