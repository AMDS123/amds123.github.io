##### Abstract
Object recognition has become a crucial part of machine learning and computer vision recently. The current approach to object recognition involves Deep Learning and uses Convolutional Neural Networks to learn the pixel patterns of the objects implicitly through backpropagation. However, CNNs require thousands of examples in order to generalize successfully and often require heavy computing resources for training. This is considered rather sluggish when compared to the human ability to generalize and learn new categories given just a single example. Additionally, CNNs make it difficult to explicitly programmatically modify or intuitively interpret their learned representations. We propose a computational model that can successfully learn an object category from as few as one example and allows its learning style to be tailored explicitly to a scenario. Our model decomposes each image into two attributes: shape and color distribution. We then use a Bayesian criterion to probabilistically determine the likelihood of each category. The model takes each factor into account based on importance and calculates the conditional probability of the object belonging to each learned category. Our model is not only applicable to visual scenarios, but can also be implemented in a broader and more practical scope of situations such as Natural Language Processing as well as other places where it is possible to retrieve and construct individual attributes. Because the only condition our model presents is the ability to retrieve and construct individual attributes such as shape and color, it can be applied to essentially any class of visual objects.

目标识别已经成为近来机器学习和计算机视觉的重要组成部分。目前的物体识别方法包括深度学习，并使用卷积神经网络通过反向传播隐式地学习物体的像素模式。然而，CNN需要数以千计的例子才能成功推广，而且通常需要大量的计算资源来进行培训。与人类仅仅通过一个例子推广和学习新类别的能力相比，这被认为相当迟钝。此外，CNN使得难以明确地以编程方式修改或直观地解释他们学习的表示。我们提出了一个计算模型，可以从一个例子中成功地学习一个对象类别，并允许它的学习风格被明确地定制为一个场景。我们的模型将每个图像分解成两个属性：形状和颜色分布。然后，我们使用贝叶斯准则来概率地确定每个类别的可能性。该模型根据重要性考虑每个因素，并计算属于每个学习类别的对象的条件概率。我们的模型不仅适用于视觉场景，而且还可以在更广泛和更实际的情况下实现，例如自然语言处理以及可以检索和构建单个属性的其他地方。因为我们的模型提供的唯一条件是能够检索和构建各种属性，如形状和颜色，所以它可以应用于任何类别的可视对象。
