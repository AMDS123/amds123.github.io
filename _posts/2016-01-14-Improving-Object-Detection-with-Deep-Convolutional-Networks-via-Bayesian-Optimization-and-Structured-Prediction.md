##### Abstract
Object detection systems based on the deep convolutional neural network (CNN) have recently made ground- breaking advances on several object detection benchmarks. While the features learned by these high-capacity neural networks are discriminative for categorization, inaccurate localization is still a major source of error for detection. Building upon high-capacity CNN architectures, we address the localization problem by 1) using a search algorithm based on Bayesian optimization that sequentially proposes candidate regions for an object bounding box, and 2) training the CNN with a structured loss that explicitly penalizes the localization inaccuracy. In experiments, we demonstrated that each of the proposed methods improves the detection performance over the baseline method on PASCAL VOC 2007 and 2012 datasets. Furthermore, two methods are complementary and significantly outperform the previous state-of-the-art when combined.

基于深度卷积神经网络（CNN）的对象检测系统最近在几个对象检测基准上取得突破性进展。虽然这些高容量神经网络学习的特征对于分类是有区别的，但不准确的定位仍然是检测的主要误差来源。基于高容量的CNN体​​系结构，我们通过以下方式来解决本地化问题：1）使用基于贝叶斯优化的搜索算法，其顺序地为对象边界框提出候选区域;以及2）用明显地损害本地化的结构化损失来训练CNN不准确。在实验中，我们证明了所提出的每种方法都改善了PASCAL VOC 2007和2012数据集上基线方法的检测性能。而且，两种方法是相辅相成的，并且在组合时明显优于先前的技术水平。
