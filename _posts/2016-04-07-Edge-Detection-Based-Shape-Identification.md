##### Abstract
Image recognition is the need of the hour. In order to be able to recognize an image, it is of immense importance that the image should be distinguishable from the background. In the present work, an approach is presented for automatic detection and recognition of regular 2D shapes in low noise environments. The work has a large number of direct applications in the real world. The algorithm proposed is based on locating the edges and thus, in turn calculating the area of the object helps in identification of a specified shape. The results were simulated using MATLAB tool are encouraging and validate the proposed algorithm. Index Terms: Edge Detection, Area Calculation, Shape Detection, Object Recognition
