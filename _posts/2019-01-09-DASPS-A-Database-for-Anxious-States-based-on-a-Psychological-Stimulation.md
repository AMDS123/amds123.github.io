##### Abstract
Anxiety affects human capabilities and behavior as much as it affects productivity and quality of life. It can be considered as the main cause of depression and suicide. Anxious states are easily detectable by humans due to their acquired cognition, humans interpret the interlocutor's tone of speech, gesture, facial expressions and recognize their mental state. There is a need for non-invasive reliable techniques that performs the complex task of anxiety detection. In this paper, we present DASPS database containing recorded Electroencephalogram (EEG) signals of 23 participants during anxiety elicitation by means of face-to-face psychological stimuli. EEG signals were captured with Emotiv Epoc headset as it's a wireless wearable low-cost equipment. In our study, we investigate the impact of different parameters, notably: trial duration, feature type, feature combination and anxiety levels number. Our findings showed that anxiety is well elicited in 1 second. For instance, stacked sparse autoencoder with different type of features achieves 83.50% and 74.60% for 2 and 4 anxiety levels detection, respectively. The presented results prove the benefits of the use of a low-cost EEG headset instead of medical non-wireless devices and create a starting point for new researches in the field of anxiety detection.
