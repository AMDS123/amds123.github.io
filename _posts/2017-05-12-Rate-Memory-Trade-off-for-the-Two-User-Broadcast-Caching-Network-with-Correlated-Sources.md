##### Abstract
This paper studies the fundamental limits of caching in a network with two receivers and two files generated by a two-component discrete memoryless source with arbitrary joint distribution. Each receiver is equipped with a cache of equal capacity, and the requested files are delivered over a shared error-free broadcast link. First, a lower bound on the optimal peak rate-memory trade-off is provided. Then, in order to leverage the correlation among the library files to alleviate the load over the shared link, a two-step correlation-aware cache-aided coded multicast (CACM) scheme is proposed. The first step uses Gray-Wyner source coding to represent the library via one common and two private descriptions, such that a second correlation-unaware multiple-request CACM step can exploit the additional coded multicast opportunities that arise. It is shown that the rate achieved by the proposed two-step scheme matches the lower bound for a significant memory regime and it is within half of the conditional entropy for all other memory values.

本文研究了具有任意联合分布的双组分离散无记忆源生成的具有两个接收器和两个文件的网络中的缓存的基本限制。每个接收器都配备了一个容量相同的缓存，所请求的文件通过共享的无差错广播链接传送。首先，提供最佳峰值速率 - 存储器折衷的下限。然后，为了利用库文件之间的相关性来减轻共享链路上的负载，提出了一种两步相关感知缓存辅助编码组播（CACM）方案。第一步使用Gray-Wyner信源编码通过一个公共描述和两个私有描述来表示库，从而第二个不需要相关的多重请求CACM步骤可以利用附加的编码组播机会。结果表明，所提出的两步方案所达到的速率匹配一个重要的记忆体制的下限，对于所有其他记忆体的价值，它在条件熵的一半内。
