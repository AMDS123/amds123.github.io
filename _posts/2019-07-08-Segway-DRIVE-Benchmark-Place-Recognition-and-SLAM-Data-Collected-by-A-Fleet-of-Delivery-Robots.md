##### Abstract
Visual place recognition and simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) have recently begun to be used in real-world autonomous navigation tasks like food delivery. Existing datasets for SLAM research are often not representative of in situ operations, leaving a gap between academic research and real-world deployment. In response, this paper presents the Segway DRIVE benchmark, a novel and challenging dataset suite collected by a fleet of Segway delivery robots. Each robot is equipped with a global-shutter fisheye camera, a consumer-grade IMU synced to the camera on chip, two low-cost wheel encoders, and a removable high-precision lidar for generating reference solutions. As they routinely carry out tasks in office buildings and shopping malls while collecting data, the dataset spanning a year is characterized by planar motions, moving pedestrians in scenes, and changing environment and lighting. Such factors typically pose severe challenges and may lead to failures for SLAM algorithms. Moreover, several metrics are proposed to evaluate metric place recognition algorithms. With these metrics, sample SLAM and metric place recognition methods were evaluated on this benchmark. 
 The first release of our benchmark has hundreds of sequences, covering more than 50 km of indoor floors. More data will be added as the robot fleet continues to operate in real life. The benchmark is available at <a href="http://drive.segwayrobotics.com/#/dataset/download.">this http URL</a>
