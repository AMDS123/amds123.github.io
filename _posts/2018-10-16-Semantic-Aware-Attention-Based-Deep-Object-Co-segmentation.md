##### Abstract
Object co-segmentation is the task of segmenting the same objects from multiple images. In this paper, we propose the Attention Based Object Co-Segmentation for object co-segmentation that utilize a novel attention mechanism in the bottleneck layer of deep neural network for the selection of semantically related features. Furthermore, we take the benefit of attention learner and propose an algorithm to segment multi-input images in linear time complexity. Experiment results demonstrate that our model achieves state of the art performance on multiple datasets, with a significant reduction of computational time.
