##### Abstract
In systems with detected planets, hot-Jupiters and compact systems of multiple planets are nearly mutually exclusive. We compare the relative occurrence of these two architectures as a fraction of detected planetary systems to determine the role that metallicity plays in planet formation. We show that compact multi-planet systems occur more frequently around stars of increasingly lower metallicities using spectroscopically derived abundances for more than 700 planet hosts. At higher metallicities, compact multi-planet systems comprise a nearly constant fraction of the planet hosts despite the steep rise in the fraction of hosts containing hot and cool-Jupiters. Since metal poor stars have been underrepresented in planet searches, this implies that the occurrence rate of compact multis is higher than previously reported. Due to observational limits, radial velocity planet searches have focused mainly on high-metallicity stars where they have a higher chance of finding giant planets. New extreme-precision radial velocity instruments coming online that can detect these compact multi-planet systems can target lower metallicity stars to find them.
