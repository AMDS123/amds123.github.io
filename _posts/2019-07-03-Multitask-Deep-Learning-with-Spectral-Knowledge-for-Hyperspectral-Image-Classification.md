##### Abstract
In this letter, we propose a multitask deep learning method for classification of multiple hyperspectral data in a single training. Deep learning models have achieved promising results on hyperspectral image classification, but their performance highly rely on sufficient labeled samples, which are scarce on hyperspectral images. However, samples from multiple data sets might be sufficient to train one deep learning model, thereby improving its performance. To do so, we trained an identical feature extractor for all data, and the extracted features were fed into corresponding softmax classifiers. Spectral knowledge was introduced to ensure that the shared features were similar across domains. Four hyperspectral data sets were used in the experiments. We achieved higher classification accuracies on three data sets (Pavia University, Pavia Center, and Indian Pines) and competitive results on the Salinas Valley data compared with the baseline. Spectral knowledge was useful to prevent the deep network from overfitting when the data shared similar spectral response. The proposed method successfully utilized samples from multiple data sets to increase its performance.
