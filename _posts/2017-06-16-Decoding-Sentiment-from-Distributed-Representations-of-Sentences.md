##### Abstract
Distributed representations of sentences have been developed recently to represent their meaning as real-valued vectors. However, it is not clear how much information such representations retain about the polarity of sentences. To study this question, we decode sentiment from unsupervised sentence representations learned with different architectures (sensitive to the order of words, the order of sentences, or none) in 9 typologically diverse languages. Sentiment results from the (recursive) composition of lexical items and grammatical strategies such as negation and concession. The results are manifold: we show that there is no `one-size-fits-all' representation architecture outperforming the others across the board. Rather, the top-ranking architectures depend on the language and data at hand. Moreover, we find that in several cases the additive composition model based on skip-gram word vectors may surpass supervised state-of-art architectures such as bidirectional LSTMs. Finally, we provide a possible explanation of the observed variation based on the type of negative constructions in each language.

最近已经开发了句子的分布式表示以表示它们作为实值向量的含义。然而，这样的陈述关于句子的极性保留了多少信息还不清楚。为了研究这个问题，我们用9种不同类型的语言对不同体系结构（对词语的顺序，句子的顺序或者没有）敏感的无监督句子表示进行解码。情感源自词汇项目的（递归）构成和诸如否定和让步之类的语法策略。结果是多方面的：我们表明，没有“一刀切”的代表架构比其他所有的代表都要好。相反，一流的体系结构取决于手头的语言和数据。此外，我们发现，在几种情况下，基于跳跃词向量的加性成分模型可能会超过监督的最先进的体系结构，如双向LSTM。最后，我们根据每种语言中的否定结构的类型提供观察到的变化的可能解释。
