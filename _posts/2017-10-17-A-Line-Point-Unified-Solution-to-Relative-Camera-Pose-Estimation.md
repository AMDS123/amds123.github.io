##### Abstract
In this work we present a unified method of relative camera pose estimation from points and lines correspondences. Given a set of 2D points and lines correspondences in three views, of which two are known, a method has been developed for estimating the camera pose of the third view. Novelty of this algorithm is to combine both points and lines correspondences in the camera pose estimation which enables us to compute relative camera pose with a small number of feature correspondences. Our central idea is to exploit the tri-linear relationship between three views and generate a set of linear equations from the points and lines correspondences in the three views. The desired solution to the system of equations are expressed as a linear combination of the singular vectors and the coefficients are computed by solving a small set of quadratic equations generated by imposing orthonormality constraints for general camera motion. The advantages of the proposed method are demonstrated by experimenting on publicly available data set. Results show the robustness and efficiency of the method in relative camera pose estimation for both small and large camera motion with a small set of points and line features.

在这项工作中，我们提出了一个统一的方法从点和线的对应关系的相对位姿估计。给定三个视图中的一组2D点和线对应关系，其中两个视图是已知的，已经开发了用于估计第三视图的相机姿态的方法。该算法的新颖之处在于在相机姿态估计中结合点和线之间的对应关系，使我们能够用少量的特征对应来计算相对姿态。我们的核心思想是利用三个视图之间的三线性关系，并从这三个视图中的点和线对应生成一组线性方程。方程组的期望解被表示为奇异向量的线性组合，并且通过求解通过施加用于一般相机运动的正交性约束而生成的小的二次方程组来计算系数。所提出的方法的优点通过在公开可用的数据集上进行实验来证明。结果表明，该方法在相对小型和大型相机运动的相对姿态估计中的鲁棒性和有效性，具有小的点和线特征。
