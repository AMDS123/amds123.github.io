##### Abstract
Humans demonstrate remarkable abilities to predict physical events in complex scenes. Two classes of models for physical scene understanding have recently been proposed: "Intuitive Physics Engines", or IPEs, which posit that people make predictions by running approximate probabilistic simulations in causal mental models similar in nature to video-game physics engines, and memory-based models, which make judgments based on analogies to stored experiences of previously encountered scenes and physical outcomes. Versions of the latter have recently been instantiated in convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures. Here we report four experiments that, to our knowledge, are the first rigorous comparisons of simulation-based and CNN-based models, where both approaches are concretely instantiated in algorithms that can run on raw image inputs and produce as outputs physical judgments such as whether a stack of blocks will fall. Both approaches can achieve super-human accuracy levels and can quantitatively predict human judgments to a similar degree, but only the simulation-based models generalize to novel situations in ways that people do, and are qualitatively consistent with systematic perceptual illusions and judgment asymmetries that people show.

人类在复杂场景中表现出非凡的能力来预测身体事件。最近提出了两类用于物理场景理解的模型：“直觉物理引擎”（IPE），它假定人们通过在类似于视频游戏物理引擎的因果心理模型中进行近似概率模拟来进行预测，这些模型根据以前遇到的场景和物理结果的存储经验进行类比判断。后者的版本最近在卷积神经网络（CNN）体系结构中被实例化。在这里，我们报告了四个实验，据我们所知，是基于仿真和基于CNN的模型的第一个严格的比较，其中两种方法都具体实例化在可以在原始图像输入上运行的算法，并产生物理判断，一堆积木会掉落。这两种方法都可以达到超人类的精确度水平，并且可以在相似的程度上对人类的判断进行定量预测，但是只有基于模拟的模型以人们所从事的方式推广到新的情境，并且在质量上与人们的系统感性幻觉和判断不对称相一致显示。
