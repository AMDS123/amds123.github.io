##### Abstract
Existing person re-identification has achieved great progress in the visible domain, capturing all the person images with visible cameras. However, in a 24-hour intelligent surveillance system, the visible cameras may be noneffective at night. In this situation, thermal cameras are the best supplemental components, which capture images without depending on visible light. Therefore, in this paper, we investigate the visible-thermal cross-modality person re-identification (VT Re-ID) problem. In VT Re-ID, there are two knotty problems should be well handled, cross-modality discrepancy and intra-modality variations. To address these two issues, we propose focusing on enhancing the discriminative feature learning (EDFL) with two extreme simple means from two core aspects, (1) skip-connection for mid-level features incorporation to improve the person features with more discriminability and robustness, and (2) dual-modality triplet loss to guide the training procedures by simultaneously considering the cross-modality discrepancy and intra-modality variations. Additionally, the two-stream CNN structure is adopted to learn the multi-modality sharable person features. The experimental results on two datasets show that our proposed EDFL approach distinctly outperforms state-of-the-art methods by large margins, demonstrating the effectiveness of our EDFL to enhance the discriminative feature learning for VT Re-ID.
