##### Abstract
Motion capturing and there by segmentation of the motion of any moving object from a sequence of continuous images or a video is not an exceptional task in computer vision area. Smart-phone camera application is an added integration for the development of such tasks and it also provides for a smooth testing. A new approach has been proposed for segmenting out the foreground moving object from the background and then masking the sequential motion with the static background which is commonly known as stroboscopic image. In this paper the whole process of the stroboscopic image construction technique has been clearly described along with some necessary constraints which is due to the traditional problem of estimating and modeling dynamic background changes. The background subtraction technique has been properly estimated here and number of sequential motion have also been calculated with the correlation between the motion of the object and its time of occurrence. This can be a very effective application that can replace the traditional stroboscopic system using high end SLR cameras, tripod stand, shutter speed control and position etc.

在计算机视觉领域，通过从连续图像或视频序列中分割任何运动对象的运动的运动捕捉并不是一个特殊的任务。智能手机相机应用程序是此类任务开发的一个新增功能，它还提供了一个平稳的测试。已经提出了从背景中分离出前景移动物体，然后用通常称为频闪图像的静态背景掩盖顺序移动的新方法。本文对频闪图像构建技术的整个过程进行了清晰的描述，并对传统的动态背景变化估计和建模问题提出了一些必要的约束。这里已经适当地估计了背景减除技术，并且已经利用对象的运动与其发生的时间之间的相关性来计算顺序运动的数量。这可能是一个非常有效的应用，可以取代传统的使用高端单反相机，三脚架，快门速度控制和位置等的频闪系统。
