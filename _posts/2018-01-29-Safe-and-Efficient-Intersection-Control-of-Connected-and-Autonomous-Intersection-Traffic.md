##### Abstract
In this dissertation, we address a problem of safe and efficient intersection crossing traffic management of autonomous and connected ground traffic. Toward this objective, an algorithm that is called the Discrete-time occupancies trajectory based Intersection traffic Coordination Algorithm (DICA) is proposed. All vehicles in the system are Connected and Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs) and capable of wireless Vehicle-to-Intersection communication. In the proposed framework, an intersection coordinates the motions of CAVs based on their proposed DTOTs to let them cross the intersection efficiently while avoiding collisions. In case when there is a collision between vehicles' DTOTs, the intersection modifies conflicting DTOTs to avoid the collision and requests CAVs to approach and cross the intersection according to the modified DTOTs. We then prove that the basic DICA is deadlock free and also starvation free. We also show that the basic DICA is conservative in computational complexity and improve it by several computational approaches. 
 Next, we addressed the problem of evacuating emergency vehicles as quickly as possible through autonomous and connected intersection traffic in this dissertation. The proposed intersection control algorithm Reactive DICA aims to determine an efficient vehicle-passing sequence which allows the emergency vehicle to cross an intersection as soon as possible while the travel times of other vehicles are minimally affected. When there are no emergency vehicles within the intersection area, the vehicles are controlled by DICA. When there are emergency vehicles entering communication range, we prioritize emergency vehicles through optimal ordering of vehicles. A genetic algorithm is proposed to solve the optimization problem which finds the optimal vehicle sequence that gives the emergency vehicles the highest priority.

在本文中，我们解决了一个安全高效的自治和连接地面交通的交叉口交通管理问题。针对这一目标，提出了一种基于离散时间占用轨迹的交叉口交通协调算法（DICA）算法。系统中的所有车辆都是连接和自主车辆（CAV），并且能够进行无线车辆间通信。在所提出的框架中，交叉口根据他们提出的DTOT协调CAV的运动，以使他们高效地跨过交叉口，同时避免冲突。当车辆的DTOT发生碰撞时，交叉路口修改冲突的DTOT以避免碰撞，并根据修改的DTOT要求CAV接近并穿越交叉路口。然后我们证明基本的DICA是无死锁的，也是无饥饿的。我们还表明，基本的DICA是计算复杂性保守，并通过几种计算方法来改善它。
 接下来，本文通过自主和相连的交叉口交通，尽快解决了紧急车辆疏散问题。所提出的交叉口控制算法无效DICA旨在确定有效的车辆通过顺序，其允许紧急车辆尽可能快地穿越交叉口，而其他车辆的行驶时间受到最小影响。当交叉口区域内没有紧急车辆时，车辆由DICA控制。当有紧急车辆进入通信范围时，我们通过优化车辆的排序来优先处理紧急车辆。提出一种遗传算法求解优化问题，寻找最优的车辆序列，给予应急车辆最高的优先级。
