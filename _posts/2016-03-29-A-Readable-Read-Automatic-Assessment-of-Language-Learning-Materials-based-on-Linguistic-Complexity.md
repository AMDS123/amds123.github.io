##### Abstract
Corpora and web texts can become a rich language learning resource if we have a means of assessing whether they are linguistically appropriate for learners at a given proficiency level. In this paper, we aim at addressing this issue by presenting the first approach for predicting linguistic complexity for Swedish second language learning material on a 5-point scale. After showing that the traditional Swedish readability measure, L\"asbarhetsindex (LIX), is not suitable for this task, we propose a supervised machine learning model, based on a range of linguistic features, that can reliably classify texts according to their difficulty level. Our model obtained an accuracy of 81.3% and an F-score of 0.8, which is comparable to the state of the art in English and is considerably higher than previously reported results for other languages. We further studied the utility of our features with single sentences instead of full texts since sentences are a common linguistic unit in language learning exercises. We trained a separate model on sentence-level data with five classes, which yielded 63.4% accuracy. Although this is lower than the document level performance, we achieved an adjacent accuracy of 92%. Furthermore, we found that using a combination of different features, compared to using lexical features alone, resulted in 7% improvement in classification accuracy at the sentence level, whereas at the document level, lexical features were more dominant. Our models are intended for use in a freely accessible web-based language learning platform for the automatic generation of exercises.

如果我们有一种评估语言是否适合学习者的语言水平，语料库和网络文本可以成为丰富的语言学习资源。在本文中，我们的目标是通过提出第一种方法来预测瑞典第二语言学习材料的语言复杂性，以5分制来解决这个问题。在表明传统的瑞典语可读性测度L \ asbarhetsindex（LIX）不适合这一任务的情况下，我们提出了一种基于一系列语言特征的监督机器学习模型，该模型能够根据难度级别可靠地对文本进行分类我们的模型得到了81.3％的准确率和0.8的F分数，这与英语水平相当，并且比其他语言的先前报道的结果高得多，我们进一步研究了我们的功能与单句子而不是全文，因为句子是语言学习练习中常见的语言单位，我们用5个班级对句子级别的数据进行了单独的模型训练，准确率为63.4％，虽然低于文档级别的表现，相邻精度为92％;而且，我们发现，与单独使用词汇特征相比，使用不同特征的组合，导致分类改善7％离子准确性在句子层面，而在文档层面，词汇特征更占优势。我们的模型旨在用于可自由访问的基于网络的语言学习平台，以自动生成练习。
