##### Abstract
Cracking of thick GaN films on sapphire substrates during the cooling down after the growth was studied. The cracking was suppressed by increasing the film-to-substrate thickness ratio and by using an intermediate carbon buffer layer, that reduced the binding energy between the GaN film and the substrate. Wafer-scale self-separation of thick GaN films has been demonstrated.
