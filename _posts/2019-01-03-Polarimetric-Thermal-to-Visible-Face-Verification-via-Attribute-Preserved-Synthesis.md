##### Abstract
Thermal to visible face verification is a challenging problem due to the large domain discrepancy between the modalities. Existing approaches either attempt to synthesize visible faces from thermal faces or extract robust features from these modalities for cross-modal matching. In this paper, we take a different approach in which we make use of the attributes extracted from the visible image to synthesize the attribute-preserved visible image from the input thermal image for cross-modal matching. A pre-trained VGG-Face network is used to extract the attributes from the visible image. Then, a novel Attribute Preserved Generative Adversarial Network (AP-GAN) is proposed to synthesize the visible image from the thermal image guided by the extracted attributes. Finally, a deep network is used to extract features from the synthesized image and the input visible image for verification. Extensive experiments on the ARL Polarimetric face dataset show that the proposed method achieves significant improvements over the state-of-the-art methods.
