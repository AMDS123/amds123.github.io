##### Abstract
A detailed investigation by one-step photoemission calculations of the GaN(0001)-(1x1) surface in comparison with recent experiments is presented in order to clarify its structural properties and electronic structure. The discussion of normal and off-normal spectra reveals through the identified surface states clear fingerprints for the applicability of a surface model proposed by Smith et al. Especially the predicted metallic bonds are confirmed. In the context of direct transitions the calculated spectra allow to determine the valence band width and to argue in favor of one of two theoretical bulk band structures. Furthermore a commonly used experimental method to fix the valence band maximum is critically tested.
