##### Abstract
This paper studied generating natural languages at particular contexts or situations. We proposed two novel approaches which encode the contexts into a continuous semantic representation and then decode the semantic representation into text sequences with recurrent neural networks. During decoding, the context information are attended through a gating mechanism, addressing the problem of long-range dependency caused by lengthy sequences. We evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed approaches on user review data, in which rich contexts are available and two informative contexts, sentiments and products, are selected for evaluation. Experiments show that the fake reviews generated by our approaches are very natural. Results of fake review detection with human judges show that more than 50\% of the fake reviews are misclassified as the real reviews, and more than 90\% are misclassified by existing state-of-the-art fake review detection algorithm.

本文研究了在特定环境或情况下生成自然语言。我们提出了两种新的方法，将上下文编码成连续的语义表示，然后用回归神经网络将语义表示解码成文本序列。在解码过程中，通过选通机制处理上下文信息，解决长序列引起的长距离依赖问题。我们评估所提出的方法对用户评论数据的有效性，其中丰富的上下文可用，并且选择两个信息上下文，情感和产品进行评估。实验表明，我们的方法产生的假评论是非常自然的。假人评审结果显示，有超过50％的假评论被错误归类为真实评论，90％以上被现有最新的假评论检测算法错误分类。
