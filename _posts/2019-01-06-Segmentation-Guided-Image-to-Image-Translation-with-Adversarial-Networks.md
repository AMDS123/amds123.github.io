##### Abstract
Recently image-to-image translation has received increasing attention, which aims to map images in one domain to another specific one. Existing methods mainly solve this task via a deep generative model, and focus on exploring the relationship between different domains. However, these methods neglect to utilize higher-level and instance-specific information to guide the training process, leading to a great deal of unrealistic generated images of low quality. Existing methods also lack of spatial controllability during translation. To address these challenge, we propose a novel Segmentation Guided Generative Adversarial Networks (SGGAN), which leverages semantic segmentation to further boost the generation performance and provide spatial mapping. In particular, a segmentor network is designed to impose semantic information on the generated images. Experimental results on multi-domain face image translation task empirically demonstrate our ability of the spatial modification and our superiority in image quality over several state-of-the-art methods.
