##### Abstract
This paper is motivated from a young boy's capability to recognize an illustrator's style in a totally different context. In the book "We are All Born Free" [1], composed of selected rights from the Universal Declaration of Human Rights interpreted by different illustrators, the boy was surprised to see a picture similar to the ones in the "Winnie the Witch" series drawn by Korky Paul (Figure 1). The style was noticeable in other characters of the same illustrator in different books as well. The capability of a child to easily spot the style was shown to be valid for other illustrators such as Axel Scheffler and Debi Gliori. The boy's enthusiasm let us to start the journey to explore the capabilities of machines to recognize the style of illustrators. We collected pages from children's books to construct a new illustrations dataset consisting of about 6500 pages from 24 artists. We exploited deep networks for categorizing illustrators and with around 94% classification performance our method over-performed the traditional methods by more than 10%. Going beyond categorization we explored transferring style. The classification performance on the transferred images has shown the ability of our system to capture the style. Furthermore, we discovered representative illustrations and discriminative stylistic elements.

本文的动机来自一个年轻男孩在完全不同的背景下认识插画师风格的能力。在由不同的插图画家翻译的“世界人权宣言”选定的权利组成的“我们全是自由的”一书中，男孩惊讶地看到一幅与“女巫小熊”系列相似的画面由Korky Paul绘制（图1）。这个风格在同一个插图画家的其他角色中也是不同的。小孩很容易发现这种风格的能力被证明对于Axel Scheffler和Debi Gliori等插画师是有效的。男孩的热情让我们开始了探索机器的能力，以识别插画风格的旅程。我们收集了儿童书籍的页面，构建了一幅由24位艺术家组成的约6500页的新插图数据集。我们利用深度网络对插画师进行分类，分类性能达到94％左右，我们的方法超过了传统方法的10％以上。超越分类我们探讨了转移风格。传输图像的分类性能表现了我们系统捕捉风格的能力。此外，我们还发现了代表性的插图和歧视性的文体元素。
