##### Abstract
This letter presents a novel approach to extract reliable dense and long-range motion trajectories of articulated human in a video sequence. Compared with existing approaches that emphasize temporal consistency of each tracked point, we also consider the spatial structure of tracked points on the articulated human. We treat points as a set of vertices, and build a triangle mesh to join them in image space. The problem of extracting long-range motion trajectories is changed to the issue of consistency of mesh evolution over time. First, self-occlusion is detected by a novel mesh-based method and an adaptive motion estimation method is proposed to initialize mesh between successive frames. Furthermore, we propose an iterative algorithm to efficiently adjust vertices of mesh for a physically plausible deformation, which can meet the local rigidity of mesh and silhouette constraints. Finally, we compare the proposed method with the state-of-the-art methods on a set of challenging sequences. Evaluations demonstrate that our method achieves favorable performance in terms of both accuracy and integrity of extracted trajectories.

这封信提出了一种新颖的方法来提取视频序列中可靠的密集和远距离运动轨迹。与强调每个跟踪点时间一致性的现有方法相比，我们还考虑了关节人跟踪点的空间结构。我们将点视为一组顶点，并在图像空间中构建三角形网格以将它们连接起来。提取远程运动轨迹的问题已经改变为随着时间的推移网格演变的一致性问题。首先，基于网格的新方法检测自遮挡，并提出了一种自适应运动估计方法来初始化连续帧之间的网格。此外，我们提出了一种迭代算法来有效地调整网格物体的顶点，从而实现物理上可信的变形，从而能够满足网格局部刚度和轮廓约束条件。最后，我们将所提出的方法与一组具有挑战性的序列中的最新方法进行比较。评估表明，我们的方法在提取的轨迹的准确性和完整性方面取得了良好的性能。
