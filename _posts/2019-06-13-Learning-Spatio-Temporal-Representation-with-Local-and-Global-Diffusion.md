##### Abstract
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) have been regarded as a powerful class of models for visual recognition problems. Nevertheless, the convolutional filters in these networks are local operations while ignoring the large-range dependency. Such drawback becomes even worse particularly for video recognition, since video is an information-intensive media with complex temporal variations. In this paper, we present a novel framework to boost the spatio-temporal representation learning by Local and Global Diffusion (LGD). Specifically, we construct a novel neural network architecture that learns the local and global representations in parallel. The architecture is composed of LGD blocks, where each block updates local and global features by modeling the diffusions between these two representations. Diffusions effectively interact two aspects of information, i.e., localized and holistic, for more powerful way of representation learning. Furthermore, a kernelized classifier is introduced to combine the representations from two aspects for video recognition. Our LGD networks achieve clear improvements on the large-scale Kinetics-400 and Kinetics-600 video classification datasets against the best competitors by 3.5% and 0.7%. We further examine the generalization of both the global and local representations produced by our pre-trained LGD networks on four different benchmarks for video action recognition and spatio-temporal action detection tasks. Superior performances over several state-of-the-art techniques on these benchmarks are reported. Code is available at: this https URL.
