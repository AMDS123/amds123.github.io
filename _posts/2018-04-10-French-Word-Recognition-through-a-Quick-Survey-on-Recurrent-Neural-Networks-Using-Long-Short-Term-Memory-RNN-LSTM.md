##### Abstract
Optical character recognition (OCR) is a fundamental problem in computer vision. Research studies have shown significant progress in classifying printed characters using deep learning-based methods and topologies. Among current algorithms, recurrent neural networks with long-short term memory blocks called RNN-LSTM have provided the highest performance in terms of accuracy rate. Using the top 5,000 French words collected from the internet including all signs and accents, RNN-LSTM models were trained and tested for several cases. Six fonts were used to generate OCR samples and an additional dataset that included all samples from these six fonts was prepared for training and testing purposes. The trained RNN-LSTM models were tested and achieved the accuracy rates of 99.98798% and 99.91889% for edit distance and sequence error, respectively. An accurate preprocessing followed by height normalization (standardization methods in deep learning) enabled the RNN-LSTM model to be trained in the most efficient way. This machine learning work also revealed the robustness of RNN-LSTM topology to recognize printed characters.

##### Abstract (translated by Google)
光学字符识别（OCR）是计算机视觉中的一个基本问题。研究表明，使用基于深度学习的方法和拓扑对印刷字符进行分类方面取得了重大进展。在当前的算法中，称为RNN-LSTM的具有长短期记忆块的递归神经网络在准确率方面提供了最高的性能。使用从互联网收集的前5000个法语单词（包括所有符号和口音），对RNN-LSTM模型进行了培训并针对多个案例进行了测试。使用六种字体来生成OCR样本，并且为了训练和测试目的准备了包括来自这六种字体的所有样本的附加数据集。对训练的RNN-LSTM模型进行了测试，分别达到编辑距离和序列误差的99.98798％和99.91889％的准确率。准确的预处理和高度归一化（深度学习中的标准化方法）使得RNN-LSTM模型能够以最有效的方式进行训练。此机器学习工作还揭示了RNN-LSTM拓扑识别印刷字符的稳健性。
