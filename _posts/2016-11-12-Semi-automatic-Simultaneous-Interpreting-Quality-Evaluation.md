##### Abstract
Increasing interpreting needs a more objective and automatic measurement. We hold a basic idea that 'translating means translating meaning' in that we can assessment interpretation quality by comparing the meaning of the interpreting output with the source input. That is, a translation unit of a 'chunk' named Frame which comes from frame semantics and its components named Frame Elements (FEs) which comes from Frame Net are proposed to explore their matching rate between target and source texts. A case study in this paper verifies the usability of semi-automatic graded semantic-scoring measurement for human simultaneous interpreting and shows how to use frame and FE matches to score. Experiments results show that the semantic-scoring metrics have a significantly correlation coefficient with human judgment.

越来越多的口译需要更客观和自动的衡量。我们认为，“翻译意味着翻译意义”的基本思想是通过比较口译输出的意义和源语言来评价口译质量。也就是说，提出了一个来自帧语义的名为Frame的“块”和来自Frame Net的名为Frame Element（FEs）的组件的翻译单元，以探索它们在目标文本和源文本之间的匹配率。本文的一个案例研究验证了半自动分级语义评分测量在人类同声传译的可用性，并展示了如何使用帧和FE匹配进行评分。实验结果表明，语义评分指标与人为判断具有显着的相关系数。
