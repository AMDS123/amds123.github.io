##### Abstract
Separating mixed distributions is a long standing challenge for machine learning and signal processing. Applications include: single-channel multi-speaker separation (cocktail party problem), singing voice separation and separating reflections from images. Most current methods either rely on making strong assumptions on the source distributions (e.g. sparsity, low rank, repetitiveness) or rely on having training samples of each source in the mixture. In this work, we tackle the scenario of extracting an unobserved distribution additively mixed with a signal from an observed (arbitrary) distribution. We introduce a new method: Neural Egg Separation - an iterative method that learns to separate the known distribution from progressively finer estimates of the unknown distribution. In some settings, Neural Egg Separation is initialization sensitive, we therefore introduce GLO Masking which ensures a good initialization. Extensive experiments show that our method outperforms current methods that use the same level of supervision and often achieves similar performance to full supervision.
