##### Abstract
We present the SAMMI lightweight object detection method which has a high level of accuracy and robustness, and which is able to operate in an environment with a large number of cameras. Background modeling is based on DCT coefficients provided by cameras. Foreground detection uses similarity in temporal characteristics of adjacent blocks of pixels, which is a computationally inexpensive way to make use of object coherence. Scene model updating uses the approximated median method for improved performance. Evaluation at pixel level and application level shows that SAMMI object detection performs better and faster than the conventional Mixture of Gaussians method.

我们提出的SAMMI轻量物体检测方法具有较高的准确性和鲁棒性，并且能够在大量摄像机的环境下运行。背景建模基于摄像机提供的DCT系数。前景检测使用相邻像素块的时间特征的相似性，这是利用对象一致性的计算上廉价的方式。场景模型更新使用近似中值方法来提高性能。像素级和应用级的评估表明，SAMMI物体检测性能比传统的高斯混合法更好更快。
