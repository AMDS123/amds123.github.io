##### Abstract
With an increased interest in applications that require a clean background image, such as video surveillance, object tracking, street view imaging and location-based services on web-based maps, multiple algorithms have been developed to reconstruct a background image from cluttered scenes. Traditionally, statistical measures and existing image quality techniques have been applied for evaluating the quality of the reconstructed background images. Though these quality assessment methods have been widely used in the past, their performance in evaluating the perceived quality of the reconstructed background image has not been verified. In this work, we discuss the shortcomings in existing metrics and propose a full reference Reconstructed Background image Quality Index (RBQI) that combines color and structural information at multiple scales using a probability summation model to predict the perceived quality in the reconstructed background image given a reference image. To compare the performance of the proposed quality index with existing image quality assessment measures, we construct two different datasets consisting of reconstructed background images and corresponding subjective scores. The quality assessment measures are evaluated by correlating their objective scores with human subjective ratings. The correlation results show that the proposed RBQI outperforms all the existing approaches. Additionally, the constructed datasets and the corresponding subjective scores provide a benchmark to evaluate the performance of future metrics that are developed to evaluate the perceived quality of reconstructed background images.

随着人们对需要干净背景图像的应用（例如视频监控，对象跟踪，街景成像和基于网页地图的基于位置的服务）的兴趣日益增加，已开发出多种算法来从杂乱的场景重建背景图像。传统上，统计测量和现有图像质量技术已被用于评估重建背景图像的质量。虽然这些质量评估方法过去已被广泛使用，但它们在评估重建背景图像的感知质量方面的性能尚未得到验证。在这项工作中，我们讨论了现有指标中的缺点，并提出了一个全面参考重构背景图像质量指数（RBQI），它使用概率求和模型将多种尺度的颜色和结构信息相结合，以预测重构背景图像中的感知质量参考图像。为了比较所提出的质量指标与现有的图像质量评估指标的性能，我们构建了两个不同的数据集，包括重建的背景图像和相应的主观评分。质量评估措施通过将其客观评分与人类主观评分相关联来评估。相关结果表明，所提出的RBQI优于所有现有的方法。此外，构建的数据集和相应的主观评分为评估未来度量标准的性能提供了一个基准，该度量标准旨在评估重建背景图像的感知质量。
