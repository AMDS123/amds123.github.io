##### Abstract
A head-mounted display (HMD) could be an important component of augmented reality system. However, as the upper face region is seriously occluded by the device, the user experience could be affected in applications such as telecommunication and multi-player video games. In this paper, we first present a novel experimental setup that consists of two near-infrared (NIR) cameras to point to the eye regions and one visible-light RGB camera to capture the visible face region. The main purpose of this paper is to synthesize realistic face images without occlusions based on the images captured by these cameras. To this end, we propose a novel synthesis framework that contains four modules: 3D head reconstruction, face alignment and tracking, face synthesis, and eye synthesis. In face synthesis, we propose a novel algorithm that can robustly align and track a personalized 3D head model given a face that is severely occluded by the HMD. In eye synthesis, in order to generate accurate eye movements and dynamic wrinkle variations around eye regions, we propose another novel algorithm to colorize the NIR eye images and further remove the "red eye" effects caused by the colorization. Results show that both hardware setup and system framework are robust to synthesize realistic face images in video sequences.

头戴式显示器（HMD）可能是增强现实系统的重要组成部分。然而，由于上面的区域被设备严重遮挡，用户体验在诸如电信和多玩家视频游戏的应用中可能受到影响。在本文中，我们首先提出一种由两个近红外（NIR）相机指向眼睛区域和一个可见光RGB相机组成的新型实验装置，以捕捉可见的脸部区域。本文的主要目的是基于这些摄像机捕获的图像合成真实的没有遮挡的人脸图像。为此，我们提出了一个新颖的综合框架，包含四个模块：三维头部重建，人脸对齐和跟踪，人脸合成和眼睛合成。在面部合成中，我们提出了一种新颖的算法，可以强健地对齐和追踪个人3D头部模型，给定一个被HMD严重遮挡的面部。在眼睛合成中，为了在眼部周围产生精确的眼部运动和动态的皱纹变化，我们提出了另一种新的算法来着色NIR眼部图像，并进一步去除由着色引起的“红眼”效应。结果表明，硬件设置和系统框架都是强大的，以合成视频序列中真实的人脸图像。
