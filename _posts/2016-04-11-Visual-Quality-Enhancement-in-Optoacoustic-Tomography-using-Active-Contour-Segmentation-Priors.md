##### Abstract
Segmentation of biomedical images is essential for studying and characterizing anatomical structures, detection and evaluation of pathological tissues. Segmentation has been further shown to enhance the reconstruction performance in many tomographic imaging modalities by accounting for heterogeneities of the excitation field and tissue properties in the imaged region. This is particularly relevant in optoacoustic tomography, where discontinuities in the optical and acoustic tissue properties, if not properly accounted for, may result in deterioration of the imaging performance. Efficient segmentation of optoacoustic images is often hampered by the relatively low intrinsic contrast of large anatomical structures, which is further impaired by the limited angular coverage of some commonly employed tomographic imaging configurations. Herein, we analyze the performance of active contour models for boundary segmentation in cross-sectional optoacoustic tomography. The segmented mask is employed to construct a two compartment model for the acoustic and optical parameters of the imaged tissues, which is subsequently used to improve accuracy of the image reconstruction routines. The performance of the suggested segmentation and modeling approach are showcased in tissue-mimicking phantoms and small animal imaging experiments.

生物医学图像的分割对于研究和表征解剖结构，检测和评估病理组织至关重要。进一步显示分割通过考虑成像区域中的激励场和组织特性的不均匀性来增强许多断层成像模态中的重建性能。这在光声层析成像中尤其重要，如果光学和声学组织特性的不连续性（如果不适当考虑的话）可能导致成像性能的恶化。光声图像的有效分割经常受到大型解剖结构的相对较低固有对比度的阻碍，这进一步受到一些常用断层成像配置的有限角度覆盖的影响。在此，我们分析横截面光声层析成像中用于边界分割的主动轮廓模型的性能。采用分段掩模构建成像组织的声学和光学参数的二室模型，其随后用于提高图像重构例程的准确性。建议的分割和建模方法的表现表现在组织模仿体模和小动物成像实验。
