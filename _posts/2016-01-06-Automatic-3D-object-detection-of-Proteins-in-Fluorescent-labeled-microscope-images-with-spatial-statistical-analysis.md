##### Abstract
Since manual object detection is very inaccurate and time consuming, some automatic object detection tools have been developed in recent years. At the moment, there is no image analysis software available which provides an automatic, objective assessment of 3D foci which is generally applicable. Complications arise from discrete foci which are very close or even come in contact to other foci, moreover they are of variable sizes and show variable signal-to-noise, and must be analyzed fully in 3D. Therefore we introduce the 3D-OSCOS (3D-Object Segmentation and Colocalization Analysis based on Spatial statistics) algorithm which is implemented as a user-friendly toolbox for interactive detection of 3D objects and visualization of labeled images.

由于手动目标检测非常不准确且耗时，近年来已经开发了一些自动目标检测工具。目前还没有可用的图像分析软件，可以自动，客观地评估一般适用的三维焦点。并发症来自与其他病灶非常接近甚至接触的离散病灶，而且它们的大小可变，并且显示出可变的信噪比，并且必须在3D中完全分析。因此，我们引入了3D-OSCOS（基于空间统计的三维对象分割和共定位分析）算法，该算法作为一个用户友好的工具箱，用于三维物体的交互式检测和标记图像的可视化。
