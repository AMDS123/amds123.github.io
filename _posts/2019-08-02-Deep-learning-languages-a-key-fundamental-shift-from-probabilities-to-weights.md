##### Abstract
Recent successes in language modeling, notably with deep learning methods, coincide with a shift from probabilistic to weighted representations. We raise here the question of the importance of this evolution, in the light of the practical limitations of a classical and simple probabilistic modeling approach for the classification of protein sequences and in relation to the need for principled methods to learn non-probabilistic models.
