##### Abstract
This paper investigates and evaluates support vector machine active learning algorithms for use with imbalanced datasets, which commonly arise in many applications such as information extraction applications. Algorithms based on closest-to-hyperplane selection and query-by-committee selection are combined with methods for addressing imbalance such as positive amplification based on prevalence statistics from initial random samples. Three algorithms (ClosestPA, QBagPA, and QBoostPA) are presented and carefully evaluated on datasets for text classification and relation extraction. The ClosestPA algorithm is shown to consistently outperform the other two in a variety of ways and insights are provided as to why this is the case.

本文研究和评估支持向量机主动学习算法与不平衡数据集一起使用，这在许多应用程序（如信息提取应用程序）中经常出现。基于最接近超平面选择和委员会查询选择的算法与基于来自初始随机样本的流行率统计的用于解决不平衡的方法（例如正扩增）组合。提出了三种算法（ClosestPA，QBagPA和QBoostPA），并对文本分类和关系提取的数据集进行了仔细评估。显示ClosestPA算法以多种方式持续优于其他两种方法，并提供了有关为什么会出现这种情况的见解。
