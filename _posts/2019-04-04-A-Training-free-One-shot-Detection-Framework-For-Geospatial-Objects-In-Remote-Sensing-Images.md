##### Abstract
Deep learning based object detection has achieved great success. However, these supervised learning methods are data-hungry and time-consuming. This restriction makes them unsuitable for limited data and urgent tasks, especially in the applications of remote sensing. Inspired by the ability of humans to quickly learn new visual concepts from very few examples, we propose a training-free, one-shot geospatial object detection framework for remote sensing images. It consists of (1) a feature extractor with remote sensing domain knowledge, (2) a multi-level feature fusion method, (3) a novel similarity metric method, and (4) a 2-stage object detection pipeline. Experiments on sewage treatment plant and airport detections show that proposed method has achieved a certain effect. Our method can serve as a baseline for training-free, one-shot geospatial object detection.
