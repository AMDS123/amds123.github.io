##### Abstract
Person Re-Identification (ReID) refers to the task of verifying the identity of a pedestrian observed from non-overlapping surveillance cameras views. Recently, it has been validated that re-ranking could bring extra performance improvements in person ReID. However, the current re-ranking approaches either require feedbacks from users or suffer from burdensome computation cost. In this paper, we propose to exploit a density-adaptive kernel technique to perform efficient and effective re-ranking for person ReID. Specifically, we present two simple yet effective re-ranking methods, termed inverse Density-Adaptive Kernel based Re-ranking (inv-DAKR) and bidirectional Density-Adaptive Kernel based Re-ranking (bi-DAKR), which are based on a smooth kernel function with a density-adaptive parameter. Experiments on six benchmark data sets confirm that our proposals are effective and efficient.

人员重新识别（ReID）是指从非重叠监视摄像机视图观察到的验证行人身份的任务。最近，经过验证，重新排名可以为ReID带来额外的性能提升。然而，目前的重新排序方法要么需要用户的反馈，要么需要繁重的计算成本。在本文中，我们建议利用密度自适应内核技术为人员ReID执行高效和有效的重新排序。具体来说，我们提出了两种简单但有效的重排序方法，称为基于平滑的基于逆密度自适应核的重排序（inv-DAKR）和基于双向密度自适应核的重排序（双重DAKR）核函数与密度自适应参数。六个基准数据集的实验证实我们的建议是有效和高效的。
