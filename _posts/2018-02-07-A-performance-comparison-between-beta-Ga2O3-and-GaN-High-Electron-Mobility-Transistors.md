##### Abstract
In this letter, we report on the quantitative estimates of various metrics of performance for \b{eta}-Ga2O3 based High Electron Mobility Transistor (HEMT) for radio frequency (RF) and power applications and compare them with III-nitride devices. It is found that despite a lower cut-off frequency, \b{eta}- Ga2O3 HEMT is likely to provide higher RF output power compared to GaN-HEMT in the low-frequency regime although a poor thermal conductivity will impose limitations in heat dissipation. On the other hand, a much lower electron mobility will limit the DC switching performance in terms of efficiency and loss although their blocking voltage can be much higher than in GaN.
