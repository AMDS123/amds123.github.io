##### Abstract
Considering music as a sequence of events with multiple complex dependencies, the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) architecture has proven very efficient in learning and reproducing musical styles. However, the generation of rhythms requires additional information regarding musical structure and accompanying instruments. In this paper we present DeepDrum, an adaptive Neural Network capable of generating drum rhythms under constraints imposed by Feed-Forward (Conditional) Layers which contain musical parameters along with given instrumentation information (e.g. bass and guitar notes). Results on generated drum sequences are presented indicating that DeepDrum is effective in producing rhythms that resemble the learned style, while at the same time conforming to given constraints that were unknown during the training process.

将音乐视为具有多个复杂依赖关系的事件序列，长期短期记忆（LSTM）架构已被证明在学习和再现音乐风格方面非常有效。然而，节奏的产生需要关于音乐结构和伴随乐器的附加信息。在本文中，我们介绍了DeepDrum，一种自适应神经网络，能够在前馈（条件）层施加的约束下产生鼓节奏，其包含音乐参数以及给定的乐器信息（例如低音和吉他音符）。生成的鼓序列的结果表明DeepDrum有效地产生类似学习风格的节奏，同时符合训练过程中未知的给定约束。
