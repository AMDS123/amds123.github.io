##### Abstract
Named entities in text documents are the names of people, organization, location or other types of objects in the documents that exist in the real world. A persisting research challenge is to use computational techniques to identify such entities in text documents. Once identified, several text mining tools and algorithms can be utilized to leverage these discovered named entities and improve NLP applications. In this paper, a method that clusters prominent names of people and organizations based on their semantic similarity in a text corpus is proposed. The method relies on common named entity recognition techniques and on recent word embeddings models. The semantic similarity scores generated using the word embeddings models for the named entities are used to cluster similar entities of the people and organizations types. Two human judges evaluated ten variations of the method after it was run on a corpus that consists of 4,821 articles on a specific topic. The performance of the method was measured using three quantitative measures. The results of these three metrics demonstrate that the method is effective in clustering semantically similar named entities.

文本文档中的命名实体是现实世界中存在的文档中的人员，组织，位置或其他类型的对象的名称。持续的研究挑战是使用计算技术在文本文档中识别这样的实体。一旦确定，就可以利用几种文本挖掘工具和算法来利用这些发现的命名实体并改进NLP应用程序。本文提出了一种基于文本语料库中语义相似性对人和组织的重要名称进行聚类的方法。该方法依赖于常见的命名实体识别技术和最近的词嵌入模型。使用用于命名实体的单词嵌入模型生成的语义相似性得分用于聚类人和组织类型的类似实体。两名人类法官在对包含特定主题的4,821篇文章的语料库进行评估后评估了该方法的十种变体。使用三种定量测量方法测量该方法的性能。这三个度量的结果表明该方法在聚类语义相似的命名实体方面是有效的。
