##### Abstract
We describe a compilation language of backdoor decomposable monotone circuits (BDMCs) which generalizes several concepts appearing in the literature, e.g. DNNFs and backdoor trees. A BDMC sentence is a monotone circuit which satisfies decomposability property (such as in DNNF) in which the inputs (or leaves) are associated with CNF encodings of some functions. We consider two versions of BDMCs. In case of PC-BDMCs the encodings in the leaves are propagation complete encodings and in case of URC-BDMCs the encodings in the leaves are unit refutation complete encodings of respective functions. We show that a representation of a boolean function with a PC-BDMC can be transformed into a propagation complete encoding of the same function whose size is polynomial in the size of the input PC-BDMC sentence. We obtain a similar result in case of URC-BDMCs. We also relate the size of PC-BDMCs to the size of DNNFs and backdoor trees.
