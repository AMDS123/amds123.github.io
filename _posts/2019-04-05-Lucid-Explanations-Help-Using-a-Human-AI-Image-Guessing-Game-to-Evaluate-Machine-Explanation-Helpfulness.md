##### Abstract
While there have been many proposals on how to make AI algorithms more transparent, few have attempted to evaluate the impact of AI explanations on human performance on a task using AI. We propose a Twenty-Questions style collaborative image guessing game, Explanation-assisted Guess Which (ExAG) as a method of evaluating the efficacy of explanations in the context of Visual Question Answering (VQA) - the task of answering natural language questions on images. We study the effect of VQA agent explanations on the game performance as a function of explanation type and quality. We observe that "effective" explanations are not only conducive to game performance (by almost 22% for "excellent" rated explanations), but also helpful when VQA system answers are erroneous or noisy (by almost 30% compared to no explanations). We also see that players develop a preference for explanations even when penalized and that the explanations are mostly rated as "helpful".
