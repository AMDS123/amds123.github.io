##### Abstract
While recent research in image understanding has often focused on recognizing more types of objects, understanding more about the objects is just as important. Recognizing object parts and attributes has been extensively studied before, yet learning large space of such concepts remains elusive due to the high cost of providing detailed object annotations for supervision. The key contribution of this paper is an algorithm to learn the nameable parts of objects automatically, from images obtained by querying Web search engines. The key challenge is the high level of noise in the annotations; to address it, we propose a new unified embedding space where the appearance and geometry of objects and their semantic parts are represented uniformly. Geometric relationships are induced in a soft manner by a rich set of nonsemantic mid-level anchors, bridging the gap between semantic and non-semantic parts. We also show that the resulting embedding provides a visually-intuitive mechanism to navigate the learned concepts and their corresponding images.

虽然最近对图像理解的研究往往侧重于识别更多类型的对象，但更多地了解对象也同样重要。认识对象的部分和属性已经被广泛研究过，但是由于为监督提供详细的对象注释的高成本，学习这些概念的大空间仍然是难以捉摸的。本文的主要贡献是从查询Web搜索引擎获得的图像中自动学习对象的可命名部分的算法。关键的挑战是注释中的高级噪声;为了解决这个问题，我们提出了一个新的统一的嵌入空间，统一表示对象的外观和几何形状及其语义部分。几何关系是通过一套丰富的非语义中间层锚来以一种柔和的方式引发的，弥合了语义和非语义部分之间的差距。我们还显示，由此产生的嵌入提供了一个直观的视觉机制来浏览学习的概念和相应的图像。
