##### Abstract
Automated dermoscopic image analysis has witnessed rapid growth in diagnostic performance. Yet adoption faces resistance, in part, because no evidence is provided to support decisions. In this work, an approach for evidence-based classification is presented. A feature embedding is learned with CNNs, triplet-loss, and global average pooling, and used to classify via kNN search. Evidence is provided as both the discovered neighbors, as well as localized image regions most relevant to measuring distance between query and neighbors. To ensure that results are relevant in terms of both label accuracy and human visual similarity for any skill level, a novel hierarchical triplet logic is implemented to jointly learn an embedding according to disease labels and non-expert similarity. Results are improved over baselines trained on disease labels alone, as well as standard multiclass loss. Quantitative relevance of results, according to non-expert similarity, as well as localized image regions, are also significantly improved.

自动皮肤镜图像分析的诊断性能快速增长。然而，采纳会面临阻力，部分原因是没有证据支持决策。在这项工作中，提出了一种基于证据的分类方法。通过CNN学习特征嵌入，三重丢失和全局平均共享，并用于通过kNN搜索进行分类。证据既作为发现的邻居，也作为与测量查询和邻居之间距离最相关的局部图像区域提供。为了确保结果在任何技能水平的标签准确性和人类视觉相似性方面都是相关的，实现了一种新的分层三重逻辑，以根据疾病标签和非专家相似性共同学习嵌入。结果比仅在疾病标签上接受培训的基线有所改善，以及标准的多类丢失。根据非专家相似度以及局部图像区域，结果的定量相关性也得到显着改善。
