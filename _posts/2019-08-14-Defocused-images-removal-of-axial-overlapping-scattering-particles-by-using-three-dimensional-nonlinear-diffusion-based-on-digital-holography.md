##### Abstract
We propose a three-dimensional nonlinear diffusion method to implement the similar autofocusing function of multiple micro-objects and simultaneously remove the defocused images, which can distinguish the locations of certain sized scattering particles that are overlapping along z-axis. It is applied to all of the reconstruction slices that are generated from the captured hologram after each back propagation. For certain small sized particles, the maxima of maximum gradient magnitude of each reconstruction slice appears at the ground truth z position after applying the proposed scheme when the reconstruction range along z-axis is sufficiently long and the reconstruction depth spacing is sufficiently fine. Therefore, the reconstructed image at ground truth z position is remained, while the defocused images are diffused out. The results demonstrated that the proposed scheme can diffuse out the defocused images which are 20 um away from the ground truth z position in spite of that several scattering particles with different diameters are completely overlapping along z-axis with a distance of 800 um when the hologram pixel pitch is 2 um. It also demonstrated that the sparsity distribution of the ground truth z slice cannot be affected by the sparsity distribution of corresponding defocused images when the diameter of the particle is not more than 35um and the reconstruction depth spacing is not less than 20 um.
