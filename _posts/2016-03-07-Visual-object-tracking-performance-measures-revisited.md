##### Abstract
The problem of visual tracking evaluation is sporting a large variety of performance measures, and largely suffers from lack of consensus about which measures should be used in experiments. This makes the cross-paper tracker comparison difficult. Furthermore, as some measures may be less effective than others, the tracking results may be skewed or biased towards particular tracking aspects. In this paper we revisit the popular performance measures and tracker performance visualizations and analyze them theoretically and experimentally. We show that several measures are equivalent from the point of information they provide for tracker comparison and, crucially, that some are more brittle than the others. Based on our analysis we narrow down the set of potential measures to only two complementary ones, describing accuracy and robustness, thus pushing towards homogenization of the tracker evaluation methodology. These two measures can be intuitively interpreted and visualized and have been employed by the recent Visual Object Tracking (VOT) challenges as the foundation for the evaluation methodology.

##### Abstract (translated by Google)
视觉跟踪评估的问题体现了各种各样的性能指标，而且在实验中应该使用哪些措施缺乏共识。这使得交叉纸跟踪器比较困难。此外，由于有些措施的效果可能不如其他措施，因此追踪结果可能会偏斜或偏向特定追踪方面。在本文中，我们重新审视流行的性能测量和跟踪器性能可视化，并从理论上和实验上对其进行分析。我们表明，从跟踪器比较所提供的信息来看，有几项措施是等价的，而且有些更为脆弱。根据我们的分析，我们将一组潜在的措施缩小到只有两个互补的措施，描述准确性和鲁棒性，从而推动跟踪器评估方法的同质化。这两个措施可以直观地解释和可视化，并被最近的视觉对象跟踪（VOT）挑战作为评估方法的基础。
