##### Abstract
When performing a conceptual analysis of a concept, philosophers are interested in all forms of expression of a concept in a text---be it direct or indirect, explicit or implicit. In this paper, we experiment with topic-based methods of automating the detection of concept expressions in order to facilitate philosophical conceptual analysis. We propose six methods based on LDA, and evaluate them on a new corpus of court decision that we had annotated by experts and non-experts. Our results indicate that these methods can yield important improvements over the keyword heuristic, which is often used as a concept detection heuristic in many contexts. While more work remains to be done, this indicates that detecting concepts through topics can serve as a general-purpose method for at least some forms of concept expression that are not captured using naive keyword approaches.

##### Abstract (translated by Google)
对概念进行概念分析时，哲学家对文本中所有形式的概念表达感兴趣，无论是直接的还是间接的，显式的还是隐含的。在本文中，我们试验了基于主题的自动化概念表达式检测方法，以促进哲学概念分析。我们提出了六种基于LDA的方法，并在一个由专家和非专家注释的新的法院判决语料库上进行评估。我们的结果表明，这些方法可以产生比关键字启发式更重要的改进，这在许多情况下经常用作概念检测启发式。虽然还有很多工作要做，但这表明通过主题检测概念可以作为至少某些形式的概念表达的通用方法，而这些表达方式并不是使用天真的关键字方法捕捉到的。
