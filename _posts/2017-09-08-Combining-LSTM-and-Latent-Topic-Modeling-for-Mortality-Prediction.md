##### Abstract
There is a great need for technologies that can predict the mortality of patients in intensive care units with both high accuracy and accountability. We present joint end-to-end neural network architectures that combine long short-term memory (LSTM) and a latent topic model to simultaneously train a classifier for mortality prediction and learn latent topics indicative of mortality from textual clinical notes. For topic interpretability, the topic modeling layer has been carefully designed as a single-layer network with constraints inspired by LDA. Experiments on the MIMIC-III dataset show that our models significantly outperform prior models that are based on LDA topics in mortality prediction. However, we achieve limited success with our method for interpreting topics from the trained models by looking at the neural network weights.

非常需要能够预测重症监护病房患者死亡率的技术，这种技术的准确性和问责性都很高。我们提出联合端到端神经网络架构，结合长期短期记忆（LSTM）和潜在话题模型，同时训练死亡率预测分类器，并从文本临床笔记中学习指示死亡率的潜在话题。为了话题可解释性，话题建模层被精心设计成受LDA启发的单层网络。在MIMIC-III数据集上的实验表明，我们的模型在死亡率预测中显着优于基于LDA主题的先前模型。然而，我们通过查看神经网络的权重，用我们从训练模型中解释话题的方法取得了有限的成功。
