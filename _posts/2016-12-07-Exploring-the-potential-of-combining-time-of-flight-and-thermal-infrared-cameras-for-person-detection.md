##### Abstract
Combining new, low-cost thermal infrared and time-of-flight range sensors provides new opportunities. In this position paper we explore the possibilities of combining these sensors and using their fused data for person detection. The proposed calibration approach for this sensor combination differs from the traditional stereo camera calibration in two fundamental ways. A first distinction is that the spectral sensitivity of the two sensors differs significantly. In fact, there is no sensitivity range overlap at all. A second distinction is that their resolution is typically very low, which requires special attention. We assume a situation in which the sensors' relative position is known, but their orientation is unknown. In addition, some of the typical measurement errors are discussed, and methods to compensate for them are proposed. We discuss how the fused data could allow increased accuracy and robustness without the need for complex algorithms requiring large amounts of computational power and training data.

结合新型低成本热红外和飞行时间范围传感器提供了新的机会。在这篇文章中，我们探讨了将这些传感器结合起来并将其融合数据用于人体检测的可能性。所提出的这种传感器组合的校准方法与传统的立体相机校准有两种基本方式不同。第一个区别是两个传感器的光谱灵敏度显着不同。实际上，根本没有灵敏度范围重叠。第二个区别是它们的分辨率通常很低，这需要特别注意。我们假设传感器的相对位置已知，但其方向未知。此外，还讨论了一些典型的测量误差，并提出了补偿方法。我们讨论如何融合的数据可以提高准确性和鲁棒性，而不需要复杂的算法需要大量的计算能力和训练数据。
