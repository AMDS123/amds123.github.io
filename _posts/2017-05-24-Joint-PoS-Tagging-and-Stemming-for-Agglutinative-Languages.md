##### Abstract
The number of word forms in agglutinative languages is theoretically infinite and this variety in word forms introduces sparsity in many natural language processing tasks. Part-of-speech tagging (PoS tagging) is one of these tasks that often suffers from sparsity. In this paper, we present an unsupervised Bayesian model using Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) for joint PoS tagging and stemming for agglutinative languages. We use stemming to reduce sparsity in PoS tagging. Two tasks are jointly performed to provide a mutual benefit in both tasks. Our results show that joint POS tagging and stemming improves PoS tagging scores. We present results for Turkish and Finnish as agglutinative languages and English as a morphologically poor language.

粘着语言中的单词形式的数量在理论上是无限的，这种形式的单词形式在许多自然语言处理任务中引入了稀疏性。词性标注（PoS标签）是这些任务中经常遇到稀疏性的任务之一。在本文中，我们提出了一个无监督的贝叶斯模型，使用隐马尔可夫模型（HMMs）进行联合PoS标记和填充凝集语言。我们使用词干来减少PoS标签的稀疏性。共同执行两项任务，为两项任务提供互惠互利。我们的研究结果表明，联合POS标签和词干提高了PoS标签分数。我们将土耳其语和芬兰语的结果作为凝集的语言和英语作为形态差的语言。
