##### Abstract
While there have been significant advances in detecting emotions from speech and image recognition, emotion detection on text is still under-explored and remained as an active research field. This paper introduces a corpus for text-based emotion detection on multiparty dialogue as well as deep neural models that outperform the existing approaches for document classification. We first present a new corpus that provides annotation of seven emotions on consecutive utterances in dialogues extracted from the show, Friends. We then suggest four types of sequence-based convolutional neural network models with attention that leverage the sequence information encapsulated in dialogue. Our best model shows the accuracies of 37.9% and 54% for fine- and coarse-grained emotions, respectively. Given the difficulty of this task, this is promising.

虽然从语音和图像识别中检测情绪有了显着的进步，但情感检测对文本的研究仍然不足，仍然是一个活跃的研究领域。本文引入了一个基于文本的多方对话情感检测语料库，以及超越现有文档分类方法的深度神经模型。我们首先提供了一个新的语料库，提供从节目中提取的对话中的连续话语的七种情绪的注释，朋友。然后，我们提出四种类型的基于序列的卷积神经网络模型，注意利用对话中封装的序列信息。我们最好的模型分别显示精细和粗粒情绪的精度分别为37.9％和54％。鉴于这项任务的困难，这是有希望的。
