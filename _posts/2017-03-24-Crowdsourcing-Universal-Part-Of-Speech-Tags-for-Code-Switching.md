##### Abstract
Code-switching is the phenomenon by which bilingual speakers switch between multiple languages during communication. The importance of developing language technologies for codeswitching data is immense, given the large populations that routinely code-switch. High-quality linguistic annotations are extremely valuable for any NLP task, and performance is often limited by the amount of high-quality labeled data. However, little such data exists for code-switching. In this paper, we describe crowd-sourcing universal part-of-speech tags for the Miami Bangor Corpus of Spanish-English code-switched speech. We split the annotation task into three subtasks: one in which a subset of tokens are labeled automatically, one in which questions are specifically designed to disambiguate a subset of high frequency words, and a more general cascaded approach for the remaining data in which questions are displayed to the worker following a decision tree structure. Each subtask is extended and adapted for a multilingual setting and the universal tagset. The quality of the annotation process is measured using hidden check questions annotated with gold labels. The overall agreement between gold standard labels and the majority vote is between 0.95 and 0.96 for just three labels and the average recall across part-of-speech tags is between 0.87 and 0.99, depending on the task.

语码转换是双语者在通讯过程中多种语言切换的现象。考虑到大量的日常代码转换，开发用于代码转换数据的语言技术的重要性是巨大的。高质量的语言注释对于任何NLP任务都是非常有价值的，而且性能常常受到高质量标注数据量的限制。但是，这种数据很少存在代码转换。在本文中，我们描述迈阿密班戈语系西班牙语 - 英语语码转换语音的人群采购通用词性标签。我们将注释任务分成三个子任务：其中一个令牌子集被自动标记，其中一个问题被专门设计来消除高频词的子集，另一个问题是其余数据的更一般的级联方法在决策树结构之后向工作人员显示。每个子任务都被扩展并适用于多语言设置和通用标记集。注释过程的质量是使用带有黄金标签注释的隐藏检查问题来衡量的。黄金标准标签和大多数投票之间的总体协议只有三个标签在0.95和0.96之间，并且根据任务，跨词类标签的平均召回率介于0.87和0.99之间。
