##### Abstract
During the past decade, with the significant progress of computational power as well as ever-rising data availability, deep learning techniques became increasingly popular due to their excellent performance on computer vision problems. The size of the Protein Data Bank has increased more than 15 fold since 1999, which enabled the expansion of models that aim at predicting enzymatic function via their amino acid composition. Amino acid sequence however is less conserved in nature than protein structure and therefore considered a less reliable predictor of protein function. This paper presents EnzyNet, a novel 3D-convolutional neural networks classifier that predicts the Enzyme Commission number of enzymes based only on their voxel-based spatial structure. The spatial distribution of biochemical properties was also examined as complementary information. The 2-layer architecture was investigated on a large dataset of 63,558 enzymes from the Protein Data Bank and achieved an accuracy of 78.4% by exploiting only the binary representation of the protein shape. Code and datasets are available at this https URL

在过去的十年中，随着计算能力的显着提高以及数据可用性的不断提高，深度学习技术由于其在计算机视觉问题上的出色表现而变得越来越流行。蛋白质数据库的规模自1999年以来增加了15倍以上，这使得旨在通过其氨基酸组成预测酶功能的模型的扩展成为可能。然而，氨基酸序列在性质上不如蛋白质结构保守，因此被认为是不太可靠的蛋白质功能预测因子。本文提出了一种新型的三维卷积神经网络分类器EnzyNet，它仅基于基于体素的空间结构来预测酶的酶委员会数量。生物化学性质的空间分布也作为补充信息被检查。对来自蛋白质数据库的63,558种酶的大数据集进行了2层结构的研究，并且通过仅利用蛋白质形状的二进制表示，获得了78.4％的精确度。代码和数据集可在此https网址获得
