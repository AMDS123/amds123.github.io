##### Abstract
Correctly identifying crosswalks is an essential task for the driving activity and mobility autonomy. Many crosswalk classification, detection and localization systems have been proposed in the literature over the years. These systems use different perspectives to tackle the crosswalk classification problem: satellite imagery, cockpit view (from the top of a car or behind the windshield), and pedestrian perspective. Most of the works in the literature are designed and evaluated using small and local datasets, i.e. datasets that present low diversity. Scaling to large datasets imposes a challenge for the annotation procedure. Moreover, there is still need for cross-database experiments in the literature because it is usually hard to collect the data in the same place and conditions of the final application. In this paper, we present a crosswalk classification system based on deep learning. For that, crowdsourcing platforms, such as OpenStreetMap and Google Street View, are exploited to enable automatic training via automatic acquisition and annotation of a large-scale database. Additionally, this work proposes a comparison study of models trained using fully-automatic data acquisition and annotation against models that were partially annotated. Cross-database experiments were also included in the experimentation to show that the proposed methods enable use with real world applications. Our results show that the model trained on the fully-automatic database achieved high overall accuracy (94.12%), and that a statistically significant improvement (to 96.30%) can be achieved by manually annotating a specific part of the database. Finally, the results of the cross-database experiments show that both models are robust to the many variations of image and scenarios, presenting a consistent behavior.

正确识别人行横道是驾驶活动和行动自主的重要任务。许多人行横道分类，检测和定位系统多年来一直在文献中提出。这些系统使用不同的视角来解决人行横道分类问题：卫星图像，驾驶舱视图（从汽车顶部或挡风玻璃后面）以及行人视角。文献中的大部分作品都是使用小型和局部数据集进行设计和评估的，即数据集呈现低度多样性。缩放到大型数据集对注释过程提出了挑战。此外，文献中仍然需要跨数据库实验，因为通常很难在最终应用的相同地点和条件下收集数据。在本文中，我们提出了一个基于深度学习的人行横道分类系统。为此，利用OpenStreetMap和Google Street View等众包平台，通过自动获取和注释大型数据库实现自动培训。此外，这项工作提出了对使用全自动数据采集和注释训练的模型与部分注释的模型进行比较研究。实验中还包括跨数据库实验，以表明所提出的方法可用于现实世界的应用。我们的研究结果表明，在全自动数据库上训练的模型实现了较高的总体准确率（94.12％），并且通过手动注释数据库的特定部分可以实现统计学显着改善（达到96.30％）。最后，跨数据库实验的结果表明，这两种模型对图像和场景的多种变化都很有效，表现出一致的行为。
