##### Abstract
Some researchers claim that language acquisition is critically dependent on experiencing linguistic input in order of increasing complexity. We set out to test this hypothesis using a simple recurrent neural network (SRN) trained to predict word sequences in CHILDES, a 5-million-word corpus of speech directed to children. First, we demonstrated that age-ordered CHILDES exhibits a gradual increase in linguistic complexity. Next, we compared the performance of two groups of SRNs trained on CHILDES which had either been age-ordered or not. Specifically, we assessed learning of grammatical and semantic structure and showed that training on age-ordered input facilitates learning of semantic, but not of sequential structure. We found that this advantage is eliminated when the models were trained on input with utterance boundary information removed.

一些研究人员声称，语言习得在很大程度上依赖于体验语言输入，从而增加复杂性。我们着手用简单的递归神经网络（SRN）来测试这个假设，这个神经网络被训练用来预测一个5百万字的儿童语音语料库CHILDES中的单词序列。首先，我们证明了年龄顺序的CHILDES在语言复杂性方面呈现出逐渐增加的趋势。接下来，我们比较了两个受过CHILDES训练的SRN的性能，这些SRN是否已经被老化。具体而言，我们评估语法和语义结构的学习，并表明对年龄有序输入的训练有利于语义的学习，而不是顺序结构的学习。我们发现，当模型在输入时被删除了话语边界信息时，这个优点被消除了。
