##### Abstract
Multitask learning has been applied successfully to a range of tasks, mostly morphosyntactic. However, little is known on when MTL works and whether there are data characteristics that help to determine its success. In this paper we evaluate a range of semantic sequence labeling tasks in a MTL setup. We examine different auxiliary tasks, amongst which a novel setup, and correlate their impact to data-dependent conditions. Our results show that MTL is not always effective, significant improvements are obtained only for 1 out of 5 tasks. When successful, auxiliary tasks with compact and more uniform label distributions are preferable.

多任务学习已成功应用于一系列的任务，主要是形态句法。然而，关于MTL的工作原理以及是否有数据特征有助于确定其成功的情况知之甚少。在本文中，我们评估了MTL设置中的一系列语义序列标注任务。我们研究不同的辅助任务，其中包括一个新的设置，并将其影响与数据相关的条件相关联。我们的研究结果表明，MTL并不总是有效，只有五分之一的任务获得了显着的改进。成功时，辅助任务的标签分布更紧凑更均匀。
