##### Abstract
Dialog acts reveal the intention behind the uttered words. Thus, their automatic recognition is important for a dialog system trying to understand its conversational partner. The study presented in this article approaches that task on the DIHANA corpus, whose three-level dialog act annotation scheme poses problems which have not been explored in recent studies. In addition to the hierarchical problem, the two lower levels pose multi-label classification problems. Furthermore, each level in the hierarchy refers to a different aspect concerning the intention of the speaker both in terms of the structure of the dialog and the task. Also, since its dialogs are in Spanish, it allows us to assess whether the state-of-the-art approaches on English data generalize to a different language. More specifically, we compare the performance of different segment representation approaches focusing on both sequences and patterns of words and assess the importance of the dialog history and the relations between the multiple levels of the hierarchy. Concerning the single-label classification problem posed by the top level, we show that the conclusions drawn on English data also hold on Spanish data. Furthermore, we show that the approaches can be adapted to multi-label scenarios. Finally, by hierarchically combining the best classifiers for each level, we achieve the best results reported for this corpus.
