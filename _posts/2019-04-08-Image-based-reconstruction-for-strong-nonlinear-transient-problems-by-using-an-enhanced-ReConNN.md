##### Abstract
With the improvement of pattern recognition and feature extraction of the Deep Neural Networks (DNNs), more and more problems are attempted to solve from the view of images. Recently, the Reconstructive Neural Network (ReConNN) was proposed to obtain an image-based model from an analysis-based model, which can help us to solve many high frequency problems with difficult sampling, e.g. sonic wave and impact. However, because the researched problems are most slightly changed process, the low-accuracy of the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and poor-diversity of the Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) make the reconstruction process low-accuracy, poor-efficiency, expensive-computation, and high-manpower. In this study, an improved ReConNN model is proposed to address the mentioned weaknesses. Through experiments, comparisons and analyses, the improved one is demonstrated to outperform in accuracy, efficiency and cost.
