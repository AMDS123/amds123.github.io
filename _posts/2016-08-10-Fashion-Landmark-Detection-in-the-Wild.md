##### Abstract
Visual fashion analysis has attracted many attentions in the recent years. Previous work represented clothing regions by either bounding boxes or human joints. This work presents fashion landmark detection or fashion alignment, which is to predict the positions of functional key points defined on the fashion items, such as the corners of neckline, hemline, and cuff. To encourage future studies, we introduce a fashion landmark dataset with over 120K images, where each image is labeled with eight landmarks. With this dataset, we study fashion alignment by cascading multiple convolutional neural networks in three stages. These stages gradually improve the accuracies of landmark predictions. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, as well as its generalization ability to pose estimation. Fashion landmark is also compared to clothing bounding boxes and human joints in two applications, fashion attribute prediction and clothes retrieval, showing that fashion landmark is a more discriminative representation to understand fashion images.

视觉时尚分析近年来备受关注。以前的工作通过包围盒或人体关节来表示服装区域。这项工作提出了时尚的标志性检测或时尚对齐，这是预测的时尚项目上定义的功能关键点的位置，如领口，下摆和袖口的角落。为了鼓励未来的研究，我们引入了具有超过120K图像的时尚地标数据集，其中每个图像标有八个地标。有了这个数据集，我们通过级联多个卷积神经网络分三个阶段研究时尚对齐。这些阶段逐渐提高了标志性预测的准确性。大量的实验证明了所提出的方法的有效性，以及其推广估计的泛化能力。时尚地标也被比作服装包围盒和人体关节的两种应用，即时尚属性预测和服装检索，表明时尚地标是理解时尚形象的一种更具辨别力的表征。
