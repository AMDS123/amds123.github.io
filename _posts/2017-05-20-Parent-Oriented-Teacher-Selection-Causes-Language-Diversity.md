##### Abstract
An evolutionary model for emergence of diversity in language is developed. We investigated the effects of two real life observations, namely, people prefer people that they communicate with well, and people interact with people that are physically close to each other. Clearly these groups are relatively small compared to the entire population. We restrict selection of the teachers from such small groups, called imitation sets, around parents. Then the child learns language from a teacher selected within the imitation set of her parent. As a result, there are subcommunities with their own languages developed. Within subcommunity comprehension is found to be high. The number of languages is related to the relative size of imitation set by a power law.

##### Abstract (translated by Google)
发展了语言多样性兴起的演化模式。我们调查了两种现实生活观察的效果，即人们更喜欢他们沟通得很好的人，人们与彼此身体接近的人进行交互。显然，与整个人口相比，这些群体相对较小。我们限制从父母身边的这样一些小组中挑选教师。然后，孩子从她父母的模仿集中选择一位教师学习语言。因此，有一些子社区开发了自己的语言。在次社区内，理解力很高。语言的数量与幂律所设定的模仿的相对大小有关。
