##### Abstract
Transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) is widely used to detect left atrium (LA)/left atrial appendage (LAA) thrombi. In this paper, the local binary pattern variance (LBPV) features are extracted from region of interest (ROI). And the dynamic features are formed by using the information of its neighbor frames in the sequence. The sequence is viewed as a bag, and the images in the sequence are considered as the instances. Multiple-instance learning (MIL) method is employed to solve the LAA thrombi detection. The experimental results show that the proposed method can achieve better performance than that by using other methods.

经食管超声心动图（TEE）广泛用于检测左心房（LA）/左心耳（LAA）血栓。在本文中，局部二元模式方差（LBPV）特征是从感兴趣区域（ROI）中提取的。动态特征是利用序列中相邻帧的信息形成的。序列被视为一个袋子，序列中的图像被视为实例。多重实例学习（MIL）方法被用来解决LAA血栓检测。实验结果表明，该方法比其他方法具有更好的性能。
