##### Abstract
Many videos depict people, and it is their interactions that inform us of their activities, relation to one another and the cultural and social setting. With advances in human action recognition, researchers have begun to address the automated recognition of these human-human interactions from video. The main challenges stem from dealing with the considerable variation in recording settings, the appearance of the people depicted and the performance of their interaction. This survey provides a summary of these challenges and datasets, followed by an in-depth discussion of relevant vision-based recognition and detection methods. We focus on recent, promising work based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Finally, we outline directions to overcome the limitations of the current state-of-the-art.

##### Abstract (translated by Google)
许多视频描绘了人们，正是他们的互动告诉我们他们的活动，彼此之间的关系以及文化和社会环境。随着人类行为识别的进步，研究人员已经开始着眼于从视频中自动识别这些人与人之间的相互作用。主要挑战源于处理录制设置的相当大的变化，所描绘的人物的外观以及他们互动的表现。该调查提供了这些挑战和数据集的摘要，然后深入讨论了相关的基于视觉的识别和检测方法。我们专注于基于卷积神经网络（CNN）的近期有前途的工作。最后，我们概述了克服当前最新技术局限性的方向。
