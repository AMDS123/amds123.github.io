##### Abstract
Lake and Baroni (2018) recently introduced the SCAN data set, which consists of simple commands paired with action sequences and is intended to test the strong generalization abilities of recurrent sequence-to-sequence models. Their initial experiments suggested that such models may fail because they lack the ability to extract systematic rules. Here, we take a closer look at SCAN and show that it does not always capture the kind of generalization that it was designed for. To mitigate this we propose a complementary dataset, which requires mapping actions back to the original commands, called NACS. We show that models that do well on SCAN do not necessarily do well on NACS, and that NACS exhibits properties more closely aligned with realistic use-cases for sequence-to-sequence models.

Lake和Baroni（2018）最近推出了SCAN数据集，该数据集由与动作序列配对的简单命令组成，旨在测试循环序列到序列模型的强泛化能力。他们最初的实验表明，这些模型可能会因为缺乏提取系统规则的能力而失败。在这里，我们仔细研究一下SCAN，并表明它并不总是捕获它所设计的泛化类型。为了缓解这种情况，我们提出了一个补充数据集，它需要将操作映射回原始命令，称为NACS。我们表明，在SCAN上表现良好的模型在NACS上不一定表现良好，并且NACS表现出与序列到序列模型的实际用例更紧密对齐的属性。
