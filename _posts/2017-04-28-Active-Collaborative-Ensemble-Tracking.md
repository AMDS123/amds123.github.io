##### Abstract
A discriminative ensemble tracker employs multiple classifiers, each of which casts a vote on all of the obtained samples. The votes are then aggregated in an attempt to localize the target object. Such method relies on collective competence and the diversity of the ensemble to approach the target/non-target classification task from different views. However, by updating all of the ensemble using a shared set of samples and their final labels, such diversity is lost or reduced to the diversity provided by the underlying features or internal classifiers' dynamics. Additionally, the classifiers do not exchange information with each other while striving to serve the collective goal, i.e., better classification. In this study, we propose an active collaborative information exchange scheme for ensemble tracking. This, not only orchestrates different classifier towards a common goal but also provides an intelligent update mechanism to keep the diversity of classifiers and to mitigate the shortcomings of one with the others. The data exchange is optimized with regard to an ensemble uncertainty utility function, and the ensemble is updated via co-training. The evaluations demonstrate promising results realized by the proposed algorithm for the real-world online tracking.

有鉴别力的集合跟踪器采用多个分类器，每个分类器对所有获得的样本进行投票。然后将这些票进行汇总，试图将目标对象本地化。这种方法依靠集体能力和集合的多样性来从不同的角度来处理目标/非目标分类任务。然而，通过使用共享样本及其最终标签来更新所有集合，这样的差异被丢失或降低到由基础特征或内部分类器的动态提供的差异。此外，分类器在努力服务于集体目标时不互相交换信息，即更好的分类。在这项研究中，我们提出了一个积极的合作信息交换计划集合跟踪。这不仅为了一个共同的目标而组织不同的分类器，而且提供了一个智能的更新机制来保持分类器的多样性，减少分类器的缺点。数据交换针对集合不确定性效用函数进行优化，并且通过协同训练来更新集合。评估结果证明了所提出的算法在实际在线跟踪方面取得了令人满意的结果。
