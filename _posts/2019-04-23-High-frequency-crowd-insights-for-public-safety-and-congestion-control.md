##### Abstract
We present results from several projects aimed at enabling the real-time understanding of crowds and their behaviour in the built environment. We make use of CCTV video cameras that are ubiquitous throughout the developed and developing world and as such are able to play the role of a reliable sensing mechanism. We outline the novel methods developed for our crowd insights engine, and illustrate examples of its use in different contexts in the urban landscape. Applications of the technology range from maintaining security in public spaces to quantifying the adequacy of public transport level of service.
