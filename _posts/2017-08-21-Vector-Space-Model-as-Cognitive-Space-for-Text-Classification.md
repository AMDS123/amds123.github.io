##### Abstract
In this era of digitization, knowing the user's sociolect aspects have become essential features to build the user specific recommendation systems. These sociolect aspects could be found by mining the user's language sharing in the form of text in social media and reviews. This paper describes about the experiment that was performed in PAN Author Profiling 2017 shared task. The objective of the task is to find the sociolect aspects of the users from their tweets. The sociolect aspects considered in this experiment are user's gender and native language information. Here user's tweets written in a different language from their native language are represented as Document - Term Matrix with document frequency as the constraint. Further classification is done using the Support Vector Machine by taking gender and native language as target classes. This experiment attains the average accuracy of 73.42% in gender prediction and 76.26% in the native language identification task.

在这个数字化的时代，了解用户的社交方面已经成为构建用户特定推荐系统的基本特征。通过在社交媒体和评论中以文本形式挖掘用户的语言共享，可以发现这些社交方面的问题。本文介绍了在PAN Author Profiling 2017共享任务中执行的实验。任务的目标是从他们的推文中找出用户的社交方面。在这个实验中考虑的社会因素方面是用户的性别和母语信息。在这里，用与母语不同的语言编写的用户推文表示为以文档频率为约束条件的文档 - 术语矩阵。使用支持向量机进行进一步的分类，将性别和母语作为目标类别。性别预测平均准确率为73.42％，母语识别任务平均准确率为76.26％。
