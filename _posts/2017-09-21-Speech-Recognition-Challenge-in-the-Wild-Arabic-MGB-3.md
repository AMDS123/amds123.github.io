##### Abstract
This paper describes the Arabic MGB-3 Challenge - Arabic Speech Recognition in the Wild. Unlike last year's Arabic MGB-2 Challenge, for which the recognition task was based on more than 1,200 hours broadcast TV news recordings from Aljazeera Arabic TV programs, MGB-3 emphasises dialectal Arabic using a multi-genre collection of Egyptian YouTube videos. Seven genres were used for the data collection: comedy, cooking, family/kids, fashion, drama, sports, and science (TEDx). A total of 16 hours of videos, split evenly across the different genres, were divided into adaptation, development and evaluation data sets. The Arabic MGB-Challenge comprised two tasks: A) Speech transcription, evaluated on the MGB-3 test set, along with the 10 hour MGB-2 test set to report progress on the MGB-2 evaluation; B) Arabic dialect identification, introduced this year in order to distinguish between four major Arabic dialects - Egyptian, Levantine, North African, Gulf, as well as Modern Standard Arabic. Two hours of audio per dialect were released for development and a further two hours were used for evaluation. For dialect identification, both lexical features and i-vector bottleneck features were shared with participants in addition to the raw audio recordings. Overall, thirteen teams submitted ten systems to the challenge. We outline the approaches adopted in each system, and summarise the evaluation results.

本文介绍了阿拉伯语MGB-3挑战 - 阿拉伯语在野外的语音识别。与去年的阿拉伯MGB-2挑战赛不同的是，MGB-3使用多种类型的埃及YouTube视频集合，强调了阿拉伯语方言阿拉伯语的阿拉伯语广播电视新闻录制时间超过1,200小时。数据收集采用了七种类型：喜剧，烹饪，家庭/孩子，时尚，戏剧，运动和科学（TEDx）。将总共​​16小时的视频分成不同的类型，分为适应，发展和评估数据集。阿拉伯语MGB挑战包括两个任务：A）语音转录，评估MGB-3测试集，以及10小时MGB-2测试集，报告MGB-2评估的进展; B）今年推出的阿拉伯语方言识别，以区分埃及，黎凡特，北非，波斯湾以及现代标准阿拉伯语四大阿拉伯方言。两个小时的每种方言的音频发布，另外两个小时用于评估。对于方言识别，除了原始录音外，词汇特征和I-vector瓶颈特征还与参与者共享。总的来说，十三个小组提交了十个系统来应对这个挑战。我们概述了每个系统采用的方法，并总结了评估结果。
