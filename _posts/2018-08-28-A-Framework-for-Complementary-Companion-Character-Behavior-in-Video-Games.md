##### Abstract
We propose a game development framework capable of governing the behavior of complementary companions in a video game. A "complementary" action is contrasted with a mimicking action and is defined as any action by a friendly non-player character that furthers the player's strategy. This is determined through a combination of both player action and game state prediction processes while allowing the AI companion to experiment. We determine the location of interest for companion actions based on a dynamic set of regions customized to the individual player. A user study shows promising results; a majority of participants familiar with game design react positively to the companion behavior, stating that they would consider using the frame-work in future games themselves.

我们提出了一种游戏开发框架，能够控制视频游戏中互补伴侣的行为。 “互补”动作与模仿动作形成对比，并被定义为友好的非玩家角色进一步推动玩家策略的任何动作。这是通过玩家动作和游戏状态预测过程的组合确定的，同时允许AI伴侣进行实验。我们根据为个人玩家定制的动态区域集确定伴侣动作的感兴趣位置。用户研究显示了有希望的结果;大多数熟悉游戏设计的参与者对伴侣行为做出积极反应，并声称他们会考虑在未来的游戏中使用框架。
