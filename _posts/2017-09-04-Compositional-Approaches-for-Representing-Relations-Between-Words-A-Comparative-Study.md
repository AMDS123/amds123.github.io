##### Abstract
Identifying the relations that exist between words (or entities) is important for various natural language processing tasks such as, relational search, noun-modifier classification and analogy detection. A popular approach to represent the relations between a pair of words is to extract the patterns in which the words co-occur with from a corpus, and assign each word-pair a vector of pattern frequencies. Despite the simplicity of this approach, it suffers from data sparseness, information scalability and linguistic creativity as the model is unable to handle previously unseen word pairs in a corpus. In contrast, a compositional approach for representing relations between words overcomes these issues by using the attributes of each individual word to indirectly compose a representation for the common relations that hold between the two words. This study aims to compare different operations for creating relation representations from word-level representations. We investigate the performance of the compositional methods by measuring the relational similarities using several benchmark datasets for word analogy. Moreover, we evaluate the different relation representations in a knowledge base completion task.

识别单词（或实体）之间的关系对于各种自然语言处理任务很重要，如关系搜索，名词修饰词分类和类比检测。表示一对单词之间关系的流行方法是从语料库中提取与单词共现的模式，并为每个单词对分配模式频率向量。尽管这种方法很简单，但由于模型无法处理语料库中先前看不到的单词对，所以它受到数据稀疏性，信息可伸缩性和语言创造力的困扰。相比之下，用于表示单词之间关系的组合方法通过使用每个单词的属性来间接地组成两个单词之间的公共关系的表示来克服这些问题。这项研究旨在比较不同的操作，从字级表示创建关系表示。我们通过使用几个基准数据集来进行词类比来测量关系相似度来研究组合方法的性能。此外，我们评估知识库完成任务中的不同关系表示。
