##### Abstract
We introduce a generative adversarial network (GAN) model to simulate the 3-dimensional Lagrangian motion of particles trapped in the recirculation zone of a buoyancy-opposed flame. The GAN model comprises a stochastic recurrent neural network, serving as a generator, and a convoluted neural network, serving as a discriminator. Adversarial training was performed to the point where the best-trained discriminator failed to distinguish the ground truth from the trajectory produced by the best-trained generator. The model performance was then benchmarked against a statistical analysis performed on both the simulated trajectories and the ground truth, with regard to the accuracy and generalization criteria.
