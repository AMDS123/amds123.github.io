##### Abstract
In this paper, we will study the simplest kind of beauty which can be found in simple visual patterns. The proposed approach shows that aesthetically appealing patterns deliver higher amount of information over multiple levels in comparison with less aesthetically appealing patterns when the same amount of energy is used. The proposed approach is used to classify aesthetically appealing patterns.
