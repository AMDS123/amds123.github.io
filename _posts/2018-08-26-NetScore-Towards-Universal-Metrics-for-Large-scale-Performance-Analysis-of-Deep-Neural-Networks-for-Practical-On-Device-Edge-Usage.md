##### Abstract
Much of the focus in the design of deep neural networks has been on improving accuracy, leading to more powerful yet highly complex network architectures that are difficult to deploy in practical scenarios, particularly on edge devices such as mobile and other consumer devices given their high computational and memory requirements. As a result, there has been a recent interest in the design of quantitative metrics for evaluating deep neural networks that accounts for more than just model accuracy as the sole indicator of network performance. In this study, we continue the conversation towards universal metrics for evaluating the performance of deep neural networks for practical on-device edge usage. In particular, we propose a new balanced metric called NetScore, which is designed specifically to provide a quantitative assessment of the balance between accuracy, computational complexity, and network architecture complexity of a deep neural network, which is important for on-device edge operation. In what is one of the largest comparative analysis between deep neural networks in literature, the NetScore metric, the top-1 accuracy metric, and the popular information density metric were compared across a diverse set of 60 different deep convolutional neural networks for image classification on the ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge (ILSVRC 2012) dataset. The evaluation results across these three metrics for this diverse set of networks are presented in this study to act as a reference guide for practitioners in the field. The proposed NetScore metric, along with the other tested metrics, are by no means perfect, but the hope is to push the conversation towards better universal metrics for evaluating deep neural networks for use in practical on-device edge scenarios to help guide practitioners in model design for such scenarios.

深度神经网络设计的重点一直是提高精度，导致更强大但高度复杂的网络架构难以在实际场景中部署，特别是在移动和其他消费设备等边缘设备上，因为它们的计算量很大和内存要求。因此，最近人们对用于评估深度神经网络的量化指标的设计感兴趣，该深度神经网络不仅仅考虑模型精度作为网络性能的唯一指标。在这项研究中，我们继续讨论用于评估深度神经网络在实际设备边缘使用中的性能的通用度量。特别是，我们提出了一种名为NetScore的新平衡指标，它专门用于对深度神经网络的准确性，计算复杂性和网络架构复杂性之间的平衡进行定量评估，这对于设备边缘操作非常重要。在文献中深度神经网络之间最大的比较分析之一，NetScore度量，前1精度度量和流行信息密度度量在不同的60个不同深度卷积神经网络中进行比较，用于图像分类。 ImageNet大规模视觉识别挑战（ILSVRC 2012）数据集。本研究中提供了针对这些不同网络的这三个指标的评估结果，作为该领域从业者的参考指南。建议的NetScore指标以及其他测试指标绝不是完美的，但希望将对话推向更好的通用指标，用于评估深度神经网络，以便在实际的设备边缘情景中使用，以帮助指导模型中的从业者为这种情况设计。
