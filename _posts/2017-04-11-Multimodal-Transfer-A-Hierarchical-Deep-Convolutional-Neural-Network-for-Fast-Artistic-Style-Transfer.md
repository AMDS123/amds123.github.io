##### Abstract
Transferring artistic styles onto everyday photographs has become an extremely popular task in both academia and industry. Recently, offline training has replaced on-line iterative optimization, enabling nearly real-time stylization. When those stylization networks are applied directly to high-resolution images, however, the style of localized regions often appears less similar to the desired artistic style. This is because the transfer process fails to capture small, intricate textures and maintain correct texture scales of the artworks. Here we propose a multimodal convolutional neural network that takes into consideration faithful representations of both color and luminance channels, and performs stylization hierarchically with multiple losses of increasing scales. Compared to state-of-the-art networks, our network can also perform style transfer in nearly real-time by conducting much more sophisticated training offline. By properly handling style and texture cues at multiple scales using several modalities, we can transfer not just large-scale, obvious style cues but also subtle, exquisite ones. That is, our scheme can generate results that are visually pleasing and more similar to multiple desired artistic styles with color and texture cues at multiple scales.

将艺术风格转化为日常照片已经成为学术界和工业界非常流行的任务。最近，离线培训取代了在线迭代优化，几乎可以实时编程。然而，当这些程式化网络直接应用于高分辨率图像时，局部区域的风格通常看起来不像所期望的艺术风格。这是因为转印过程无法捕捉小而复杂的纹理，并保持作品的正确纹理尺度。在这里，我们提出了一个多模态卷积神经网络，考虑到忠实的颜色和亮度通道的表示，并进行分层次的多重损失的增加尺度的程式化。与最先进的网络相比，我们的网络也可以通过离线进行更为复杂的培训，近乎实时地进行风格转换。通过多种形式，适当处理多种尺度的风格和纹理线索，不仅可以传递大型，明显的风格线索，还可以传递细腻，精致的线索。也就是说，我们的方案可以产生视觉上令人愉悦的结果，并且在多个尺度上具有多种期望的艺术风格，具有颜色和纹理提示。
