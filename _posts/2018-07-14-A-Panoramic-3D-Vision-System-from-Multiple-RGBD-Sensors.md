##### Abstract
This letter presents a panoramic 3D vision system that was designed specifically for mapping the indoor environment. The system consists of multiple RGBD sensors that cover a 360$^\circ$ field of view, simplifying the reconstruction of indoor environments. A new extrinsic calibration approach is proposed to estimate the relative poses between the RGBD sensors. This approach relies on well-matched keypoints from a descriptor-based pattern, in this case, of a minimally overlapping field of view between sensors. A distributed capturing system was also designed to provide panoramic RGBD frames in real time. Experiments validate the accuracy of the proposed calibration approach and the efficiency of the proposed panoramic 3D vision system for indoor mapping.

这封信展示了一个全景3D视觉系统，专为绘制室内环境而设计。该系统由多个RGBD传感器组成，覆盖360美元的视野，简化了室内环境的重建。提出了一种新的外部校准方法来估计RGBD传感器之间的相对姿态。该方法依赖于来自基于描述符的模式的良好匹配的关键点，在这种情况下，传感器之间的最小重叠视野。分布式捕获系统还被设计为实时提供全景RGBD帧。实验验证了所提出的校准方法的准确性以及所提出的用于室内地图的全景3D视觉系统的效率。
