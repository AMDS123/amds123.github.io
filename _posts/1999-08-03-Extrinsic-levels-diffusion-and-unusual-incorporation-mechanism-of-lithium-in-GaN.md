##### Abstract
Results of a first-principles study of the Li impurity in GaN are presented. We find Li is a channel interstitial, with an onset for diffusion at T$\sim$ 600 K. Above this temperature, Li can transform to a Ga-substitutional acceptor by exothermic recombination with Ga vacancies. This process implies capture of at least one electron; therefore Li acts as an electron sink. Li$_{\rm Ga}$ is stable again interstitialcy, and has a shallow first ionization levels of 0.16 eV, and second ionization at 0.63 eV. Lattice locations and their temperature dependence are in close agreement with recent experiments.
