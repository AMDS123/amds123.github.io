##### Abstract
Harmful algae blooms (HABs), which produce lethal toxins, are a growing global concern since they negatively affect the quality of drinking water and have major negative impact on wildlife, the fishing industry, as well as tourism and recreational water use. In this study, we investigate the feasibility of leveraging machine learning and fluorescence-based spectral-morphological features to enable the identification of six different algae types in an automated fashion. More specifically, a custom multi-band fluorescence imaging microscope is used to capture fluorescence imaging data of a water sample at six different excitation wavelengths ranging from 405 nm - 530 nm. A number of morphological and spectral fluorescence features are then extracted from the isolated micro-organism imaging data, and used to train neural network classification models designed for the purpose of identification of the six algae types given an isolated micro-organism. Experimental results using three different neural network classification models showed that the use of either fluorescence-based spectral features or fluorescence-based spectral-morphological features to train neural network classification models led to statistically significant improvements in identification accuracy when compared to the use of morphological features (with average identification accuracies of 95.7%+/-3.5% and 96.1%+/-1.5%, respectively). These preliminary results are quite promising, given that the identification accuracy of human taxonomists are typically between the range of 67% and 83%, and thus illustrates the feasibility of leveraging machine learning and fluorescence-based spectral-morphological features as a viable method for automated identification of different algae types.

产生致命毒素的有害藻类绽放（HABs）是全球日益关注的问题，因为它们对饮用水质量产生负面影响，并对野生动物，捕鱼业以及旅游业和娱乐用水产生重大负面影响。在这项研究中，我们调查了利用机器学习和基于荧光的光谱形态学特征的可行性，以便能够以自动化的方式识别六种不同的藻类。更具体地说，使用定制的多波段荧光成像显微镜来捕获在405nm-530nm范围内的六种不同激发波长下的水样品的荧光成像数据。然后从分离的微生物成像数据中提取许多形态学和光谱荧光特征，并用于训练神经网络分类模型，该模型设计用于鉴定给定分离的微生物的六种藻类类型。使用三种不同的神经网络分类模型的实验结果表明，与使用形态学特征相比，使用基于荧光的光谱特征或基于荧光的光谱形态学特征来训练神经网络分类模型导致识别准确度的统计学显着提高（平均识别准确率分别为95.7％+ /  -  3.5％和96.1％+ /  -  1.5％）。鉴于人类分类学家的识别准确度通常在67％至83％的范围内，因此这些初步结果相当有希望，因此说明利用机器学习和基于荧光的光谱形态特征作为自动化的可行方法的可行性鉴定不同的藻类。
