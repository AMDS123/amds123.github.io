##### Abstract
Gastrointestinal (GI) cancers account for 1.5 million deaths worldwide. Endoscopic Submucosal Dissection (ESD) is an advanced therapeutic endoscopy technique with superior clinical outcome due to the minimally invasive and en bloc removal of tumours. In the western world, ESD is seldom carried out, due to its complex and challenging nature. Various surgical systems are being developed to make this therapy accessible, however, these solutions have shown limited operational workspace, dexterity, or low force exertion capabilities. The current paper shows the ESD CYCLOPS system, a bimanual surgical robotic attachment that can be mounted at the end of any flexible endoscope. The system is able to achieve forces of up to 46N, and showed a mean error of 0.217mm during an elliptical tracing task. The workspace and instrument dexterity is shown by pre-clinical ex vivo trials, in which ESD is succesfully performed by a GI surgeon. The system is currently undergoing pre-clinical in vivo validation.

胃肠道（GI）癌症在全世界有150万人死亡。内镜粘膜下剥离术（ESD）是一种先进的内窥镜治疗技术，由于肿瘤的微创和整块切除，具有优越的临床效果。在西方国家，可持续发展教育由于其复杂和具有挑战性而很少得到执行。目前正在开发各种手术系统以使这种治疗方法可以获得，但是这些方案显示出有限的操作工作空间，灵活性或低施力能力。目前的论文展示了ESD CYCLOPS系统，一种双手手术机器人附件，可安装在任何柔性内窥镜的末端。该系统能够实现高达46N的力，并且在椭圆形跟踪任务中显示出0.217mm的平均误差。临床前体外试验显示了工作场所和仪器的灵活性，其中ESD是由GI外科医生成功完成的。该系统目前正在进行临床前体内验证。
