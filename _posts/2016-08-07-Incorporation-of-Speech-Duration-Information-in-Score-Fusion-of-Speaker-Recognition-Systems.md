##### Abstract
In recent years identity-vector (i-vector) based speaker verification (SV) systems have become very successful. Nevertheless, environmental noise and speech duration variability still have a significant effect on degrading the performance of these systems. In many real-life applications, duration of recordings are very short; as a result, extracted i-vectors cannot reliably represent the attributes of the speaker. Here, we investigate the effect of speech duration on the performance of three state-of-the-art speaker recognition systems. In addition, using a variety of available score fusion methods, we investigate the effect of score fusion for those speaker verification techniques to benefit from the performance difference of different methods under different enrollment and test speech duration conditions. This technique performed significantly better than the baseline score fusion methods.

近年来，基于身份向量（i向量）的说话人验证（SV）系统已经非常成功。尽管如此，环境噪声和语音持续时间的变化仍然对降低这些系统的性能产生显着的影响。在许多现实应用中，录音的持续时间非常短，结果，所提取的i向量不能可靠地表示说话者的属性。在这里，我们调查语音持续时间对三个最先进的说话人识别系统的性能的影响。另外，利用多种可用的分数融合方法，研究了不同入场和测试语音持续时间条件下不同入场方式下，不同入场方式下的分数融合对说话人验证技术的影响。这种技术比基线评分融合方法表现得更好。
