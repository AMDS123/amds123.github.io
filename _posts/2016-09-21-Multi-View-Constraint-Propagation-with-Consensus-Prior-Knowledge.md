##### Abstract
In many applications, the pairwise constraint is a kind of weaker supervisory information which can be collected easily. The constraint propagation has been proved to be a success of exploiting such side-information. In recent years, some methods of multi-view constraint propagation have been proposed. However, the problem of reasonably fusing different views remains unaddressed. In this paper, we present a method dubbed Consensus Prior Constraint Propagation (CPCP), which can provide the prior knowledge of the robustness of each data instance and its neighborhood. With the robustness generated from the consensus information of each view, we build a unified affinity matrix as a result of the propagation. Specifically, we fuse the affinity of different views at a data instance level instead of a view level. This paper also introduces an approach to deal with the imbalance between the positive and negative constraints. The proposed method has been tested in clustering tasks on two publicly available multi-view data sets to show the superior performance.

在许多应用中，成对约束是一种可以容易地收集的较弱的监督信息。约束传播已被证明是利用这种边信息的成功。近年来，提出了多视点约束传播的一些方法。然而，合理地融合不同观点的问题仍然没有得到解决。在本文中，我们提出一种被称为一致预先约束传播（CPCP）的方法，其可以提供关于每个数据实例及其邻居的鲁棒性的先验知识。利用每个视图的共识信息产生的鲁棒性，我们建立一个统一的亲和矩阵作为传播的结果。具体而言，我们在数据实例级别而不是视图级别上融合了不同视图的关联性。本文还介绍了一种处理正负约束不平衡的方法。所提出的方法已经在两个公开可用的多视图数据集上的集群任务中进行了测试，以显示出优异的性能。
