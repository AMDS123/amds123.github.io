##### Abstract
Augmented Reality (AR) brings immersive experiences to users. With recent advances in computer vision and mobile computing, AR has scaled across platforms, and has increased adoption in major products. One of the key challenges in enabling AR features is proper anchoring of the virtual content to the real world, a process referred to as tracking. In this paper, we present a system for motion tracking, which is capable of robustly tracking planar targets and performing relative-scale 6DoF tracking without calibration. Our system runs in real-time on mobile phones and has been deployed in multiple major products on hundreds of millions of devices.
