##### Abstract
Matching individuals across non-overlapping camera networks, known as person re-identification, is a fundamentally challenging problem due to the large visual appearance changes caused by variations of viewpoints, lighting, and occlusion. Approaches in literature can be categoried into two streams: The first stream is to develop reliable features against realistic conditions by combining several visual features in a pre-defined way; the second stream is to learn a metric from training data to ensure strong inter-class differences and intra-class similarities. However, seeking an optimal combination of visual features which is generic yet adaptive to different benchmarks is a unsoved problem, and metric learning models easily get over-fitted due to the scarcity of training data in person re-identification. In this paper, we propose two effective structured learning based approaches which explore the adaptive effects of visual features in recognizing persons in different benchmark data sets. Our framework is built on the basis of multiple low-level visual features with an optimal ensemble of their metrics. We formulate two optimization algorithms, CMCtriplet and CMCstruct, which directly optimize evaluation measures commonly used in person re-identification, also known as the Cumulative Matching Characteristic (CMC) curve.

在非重叠摄像机网络上匹配个人（称为个人重新识别）是由于由视点，光线和遮挡的变化引起的大的视觉外观变化，这是一个基本上具有挑战性的问题。文献中的方法可以分为两类：第一类是通过以预先定义的方式组合几个视觉特征来开发可靠的特征，使其与现实条件相对立;第二个流是从训练数据中学习一个度量，以确保强大的类间差异和类内相似性。然而，寻求一种通用而又适应不同基准的视觉特征的最佳组合是一个难以解决的问题，而且由于训练数据在个人重新识别中的缺乏，度量学习模型容易过度拟合。在本文中，我们提出了两种有效的基于结构学习的方法，探索视觉特征在不同基准数据集中识别人的适应性效应。我们的框架建立在多个低级视觉特征的基础上，并且具有最佳的指标集合。我们制定了两个优化算法：CMCtriplet和CMCstruct，直接优化人重新识别中常用的评估指标，即累积匹配特征（CMC）曲线。
