##### Abstract
Lifelong machine learning is a novel machine learning paradigm which continually learns tasks and accumulates knowledge for reuse. The knowledge extracting and reusing abilities enable lifelong machine learning to understand the knowledge for solving a task and obtain the ability to solve the related problems. In sentiment classification, traditional approaches like Naive Bayes focus on the probability for each word with positive or negative sentiment. However, the lifelong machine learning in this paper will investigate this problem in a different angle and attempt to discover which words determine the sentiment of a review. We will pay all attention to obtain knowledge during learning for future learning rather than just solve a current task.
