##### Abstract
Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease. Amnestic mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is a common first symptom before the conversion to clinical impairment where the individual becomes unable to perform activities of daily living independently. Although there is currently no treatment available, the earlier a conclusive diagnosis is made, the earlier the potential for interventions to delay or perhaps even prevent progression to full-blown AD. Neuroimaging scans acquired from MRI and metabolism images obtained by FDG-PET provide in-vivo view into the structure and function (glucose metabolism) of the living brain. It is hypothesized that combining different image modalities could better characterize the change of human brain and result in a more accuracy early diagnosis of AD. In this paper, we proposed a novel framework to discriminate normal control(NC) subjects from subjects with AD pathology (AD and NC, MCI subjects convert to AD in future). Our novel approach utilizing a multimodal and multiscale deep neural network was found to deliver a 85.68\% accuracy in the prediction of subjects within 3 years to conversion. Cross validation experiments proved that it has better discrimination ability compared with results in existing published literature.

阿尔茨海默病（AD）是一种渐进性神经退行性疾病。遗忘性轻度认知功能障碍（MCI）是转换为临床损伤前的常见首发症状，个体无法独立进行日常生活活动。尽管目前还没有可用的治疗方法，但是越早作出结论性的诊断，越早有可能进行干预以延缓甚至阻止进展为完全的AD。从MRI获得的神经影像学扫描和由FDG-PET获得的代谢图像提供活体大脑的结构和功能（葡萄糖代谢）的体内视图。假设结合不同的图像形态可以更好地表征人脑的变化，从而更准确地早期诊断AD。在本文中，我们提出了一个新的框架区分正常对照（NC）受试者从AD病理学（AD和NC，MCI受试者将来转换为AD）。我们使用多模式和多尺度深度神经网络的新方法被发现在3年内预测对象的转换准确率为85.68％。交叉验证实验证明，与已有文献的结果相比，它具有更好的判别能力。
