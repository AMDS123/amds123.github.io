##### Abstract
The image is a very important mean of communication in the field of architectural who intervenes in the various phases of the design of a project. It can be regarded as a tool of decision-making aid. The study of our research aims at to see the contribution of the Economic Intelligence in the resolution of a decisional problem of the various partners (Architect, Contractor, Customer) in the architectural field, in order to make strategic decisions within the framework of the realization or design of an architectural work. The economic Intelligence allows the taking into account of the real needs for the user-decision makers, so that their waiting are considered at the first stage of a search for information and not in the final stage of the development of the tool in the evaluation of this last.
