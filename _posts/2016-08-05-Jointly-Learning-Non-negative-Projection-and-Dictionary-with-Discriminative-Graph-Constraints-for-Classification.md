##### Abstract
Sparse coding with dictionary learning (DL) has shown excellent classification performance. Despite the considerable number of existing works, how to obtain features on top of which dictionaries can be better learned remains an open and interesting question. Many current prevailing DL methods directly adopt well-performing crafted features. While such strategy may empirically work well, it ignores certain intrinsic relationship between dictionaries and features. We propose a framework where features and dictionaries are jointly learned and optimized. The framework, named joint non-negative projection and dictionary learning (JNPDL), enables interaction between the input features and the dictionaries. The non-negative projection leads to discriminative parts-based object features while DL seeks a more suitable representation. Discriminative graph constraints are further imposed to simultaneously maximize intra-class compactness and inter-class separability. Experiments on both image and image set classification show the excellent performance of JNPDL by outperforming several state-of-the-art approaches.

使用字典学习（DL）的稀疏编码已经表现出优异的分类性能。尽管现有的作品数量相当多，但如何在字典之上获得更好的特征仍然是一个开放而有趣的问题。许多当前流行的DL方法直接采用性能良好的特征。虽然这样的策略可能在经验上运作良好，但它忽略了词典和特征之间的某种内在联系。我们提出了一个功能和词典共同学习和优化的框架。该框架被称为联合非负投影和字典学习（JNPDL），使得输入特征和字典之间的交互成为可能。非负投影导致可辨识的基于零件的对象特征，而DL寻求更合适的表示。进一步实施区分图约束来同时最大化类内紧密性和类间可分性。对图像和图像集合分类的实验通过超越几种最先进的方法显示了JNPDL的优异性能。
