##### Abstract
Humans use language to collectively execute complex strategies in addition to using it as a referential tool for referring to physical entities. While existing approaches that study the emergence of language in settings where the language mainly acts as a referential tool, in this paper, we study the role of emergent languages in discovering and implementing strategies in a multi-agent setting. The agents in our setup are connected via a network and are allowed to exchange messages in the form of sequences of discrete symbols. We formulate the problem as a voting game, where two candidate agents are contesting in an election and their goal is to convince the population members (other agents) in the network to vote for them by sending them messages. We use neural networks to parameterize the policies followed by agents in the game. We investigate the effect of choosing different training objectives and strategies for agents in the game and make observations about the emergent language in each case. To the best of our knowledge this is the first work that explores emergence of language for discovering and implementing strategies in a setting where agents are connected via an underlying network.
