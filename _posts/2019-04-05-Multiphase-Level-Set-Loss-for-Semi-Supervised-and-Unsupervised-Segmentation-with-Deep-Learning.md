##### Abstract
Recent state-of-the-art image segmentation algorithms are mostly based on deep neural network, thanks to its high performance and fast computation time. However, these methods are usually trained in a supervised manner, which requires large number of high quality ground-truth segmentation masks. On the other hand, classical image segmentation approaches such as level-set methods are still useful to help generation of segmentation masks without labels, but these algorithms are usually computationally expensive and often have limitation in semantic segmentation. In this paper, we propose a novel multiphase level-set loss function for deep learning-based semantic image segmentation without or with small labeled data. This loss function is based on the observation that the softmax layer of deep neural networks has striking similarity to the characteristic function in the classical multiphase level-set algorithms. We show that the multiphase level-set loss function enables semi-supervised or even unsupervised semantic segmentation. In addition, our loss function can be also used as a regularized function to enhance supervised semantic segmentation algorithms. Experimental results on multiple datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.
