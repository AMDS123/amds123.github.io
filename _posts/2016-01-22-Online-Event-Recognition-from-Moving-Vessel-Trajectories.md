##### Abstract
We present a system for online monitoring of maritime activity over streaming positions from numerous vessels sailing at sea. It employs an online tracking module for detecting important changes in the evolving trajectory of each vessel across time, and thus can incrementally retain concise, yet reliable summaries of its recent movement. In addition, thanks to its complex event recognition module, this system can also offer instant notification to marine authorities regarding emergency situations, such as risk of collisions, suspicious moves in protected zones, or package picking at open sea. Not only did our extensive tests validate the performance, efficiency, and robustness of the system against scalable volumes of real-world and synthetically enlarged datasets, but its deployment against online feeds from vessels has also confirmed its capabilities for effective, real-time maritime surveillance.

我们提供了一个在海上航行的众多船只在线监测海上活动的系统。它采用一个在线追踪模块来检测每艘船在不断变化的轨迹上的重要变化，因此可以递增地保留其近期运动的简明而可靠的总结。此外，得益于其复杂的事件识别模块，该系统还可以向海事当局提供有关紧急情况的即时通知，例如碰撞危险，保护区内的可疑移动或在公海采摘包裹等。我们的大量测试不仅验证了系统的性能，效率和稳健性，以及可扩展的真实世界和综合放大数据集的数量，而且还针对船舶的在线提要进行了部署，也证实了其有效的实时海事监视。
