##### Abstract
WTA (Winner Take All) hashing has been successfully applied in many large scale vision applications. This hashing scheme was tailored to take advantage of the comparative reasoning (or order based information), which showed significant accuracy improvements. In this paper, we identify a subtle issue with WTA, which grows with the sparsity of the datasets. This issue limits the discriminative power of WTA. We then propose a solution for this problem based on the idea of Densification which provably fixes the issue. Our experiments show that Densified WTA Hashing outperforms Vanilla WTA both in image classification and retrieval tasks consistently and significantly.

WTA（Winner Take All）哈希已成功应用于许多大型视觉应用。这个散列方案是为了利用比较推理（或者基于订单的信息）而设计的，它显示出显着的准确性改进。在本文中，我们确定了WTA的一个微妙的问题，WTA随着数据集的稀疏性而增长。这个问题限制了WTA的判别力。然后，我们提出了一个解决这个问题的基础上的密化概念，可证实的问题。我们的实验表明，密集的WTA哈希在图像分类和检索任务方面均优于香草WTA，并始终如一地显着。
