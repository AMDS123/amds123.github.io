##### Abstract
This work addresses the problem of extracting deeply learned features directly from compressive measurements. There has been no work in this area. Existing deep learning tools only give good results when applied on the full signal, that too usually after preprocessing. These techniques require the signal to be reconstructed first. In this work we show that by learning directly from the compressed domain, considerably better results can be obtained. This work extends the recently proposed framework of deep matrix factorization in combination with blind compressed sensing; hence the term deep blind compressed sensing. Simulation experiments have been carried out on imaging via single pixel camera, under-sampled biomedical signals, arising in wireless body area network and compressive hyperspectral imaging. In all cases, the superiority of our proposed deep blind compressed sensing can be envisaged.

这项工作解决了直接从压缩测量中提取深度学习特征的问题。这方面一直没有工作。现有的深度学习工具在应用于全信号时只会给出好的结果，通常在预处理之后也是如此。这些技术要求首先重构信号。在这项工作中，我们表明通过直接从压缩域学习，可以获得相当好的结果。这项工作扩展了最近提出的与深度矩阵分解相结合的盲压缩感知框架。因此术语深度压缩感测。通过单像素摄像机成像，对无线体域网和压缩高光谱成像产生的欠采样生物医学信号进行了仿真实验。在所有情况下，都可以设想我们提出的深度压缩感测的优越性。
