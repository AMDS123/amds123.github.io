##### Abstract
LIDAR is one of the most important sensors for Unmanned Ground Vehicles (UGV). Object detection and classification based on lidar point cloud is a key technology for UGV. In object detection and classification, the mutual occlusion between neighboring objects is an important factor affecting the accuracy. In this paper, we consider occlusion as an intrinsic property of the point cloud data. We propose a novel approach that explicitly model the occlusion. The occlusion property is then taken into account in the subsequent classification step. We perform experiments on the KITTI dataset. Experimental results indicate that by utilizing the occlusion property that we modeled, the classifier obtains much better performance.
