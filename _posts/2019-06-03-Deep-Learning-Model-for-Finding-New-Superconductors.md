##### Abstract
Superconductivity has been extensively studied since its discovery in 1911. However, the feasibility of room-temperature superconductivity is unknown. There is no theory of high-temperature superconductors and there are no computational methods for strongly correlated systems, in which high-temperature superconductivity emerges. Exploration of new superconductors still relies on the experience and intuition of experts, and is largely a process of experimental trial and error. In one study, only 3\% of the candidate materials showed superconductivity~\cite{1468-6996-16-3-033503}. Here we report an interdisciplinary attempt for finding new superconductors based on deep learning. We represented the periodic table in a way that allows a deep learning model to learn it. Although we used only the chemical composition of materials as information, we obtained an $R^{2}$ value of 0.92 for predicting the superconducting transition temperature, $T_\text{c}$, for materials in a database of superconductors. We obtained three remarkable results. The deep learning method can predict superconductivity for a material with a precision of 55\%, which shows the usefulness of the model; it found the recently discovered superconductor \ce{CaBi2}, which is not in the superconductor database; and it found Fe-based high-temperature superconductors (discovered in 2008) from the training data before 2008. These results open the way for the discovery of new high-temperature superconductor families.
