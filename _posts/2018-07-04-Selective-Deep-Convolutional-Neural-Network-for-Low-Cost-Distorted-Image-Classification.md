##### Abstract
Deep convolutional neural networks have proven to be well suited for image classification applications. However, if there is distortion in the image, the classification accuracy can be significantly degraded, even with state-of-the-art neural networks. The accuracy cannot be significantly improved by simply training with distorted images. Instead, this paper proposes a multiple neural network topology referred to as a selective deep convolutional neural network. By modifying existing state-of-the-art neural networks in the proposed manner, it is shown that a similar level of classification accuracy can be achieved, but at a significantly lower cost. The cost reduction is obtained primarily through the use of fewer weight parameters. Using fewer weights reduces the number of multiply-accumulate operations and also reduces the energy required for data accesses. Finally, it is shown that the effectiveness of the proposed selective deep convolutional neural network can be further improved by combining it with previously proposed network cost reduction methods.

##### Abstract (translated by Google)
深度卷积神经网络已被证明非常适合图像分类应用。然而，如果图像中存在失真，即使使用最先进的神经网络，分类精度也会显着降低。简单地训练失真图像不能显着提高准确度。相反，本文提出了一种多神经网络拓扑，称为选择性深度卷积神经网络。通过以所提出的方式修改现有的现有神经网络，示出了可以实现类似水平的分类准确度，但成本显着降低。降低成本主要是通过使用较少的重量参数来获得的。使用较少的权重减少了乘法累加运算的数量，并且还减少了数据访问所需的能量。最后，表明通过将其与先前提出的网络成本降低方法相结合，可以进一步改善所提出的选择性深度卷积神经网络的有效性。
