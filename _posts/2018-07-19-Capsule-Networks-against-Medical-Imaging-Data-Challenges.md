##### Abstract
A key component to the success of deep learning is the availability of massive amounts of training data. Building and annotating large datasets for solving medical image classification problems is today a bottleneck for many applications. Recently, capsule networks were proposed to deal with shortcomings of Convolutional Neural Networks (ConvNets). In this work, we compare the behavior of capsule networks against ConvNets under typical datasets constraints of medical image analysis, namely, small amounts of annotated data and class-imbalance. We evaluate our experiments on MNIST, Fashion-MNIST and medical (histological and retina images) publicly available datasets. Our results suggest that capsule networks can be trained with less amount of data for the same or better performance and are more robust to an imbalanced class distribution, which makes our approach very promising for the medical imaging community.

深度学习成功的关键因素是大量培训数据的可用性。构建和注释用于解决医学图像分类问题的大型数据集是当今许多应用的瓶颈。最近，提出了胶囊网络来处理卷积神经网络（ConvNets）的缺点。在这项工作中，我们比较了医学图像分析的典型数据集约束下胶囊网络与ConvNets的行为，即少量注释数据和类不平衡。我们评估我们在MNIST，Fashion-MNIST和医学（组织学和视网膜图像）公开可用数据集上的实验。我们的研究结果表明，对于相同或更好的性能，胶囊网络可以用较少的数据进行训练，并且对于不平衡的类分布更加健壮，这使得我们的方法对于医学成像社区非常有前景。
