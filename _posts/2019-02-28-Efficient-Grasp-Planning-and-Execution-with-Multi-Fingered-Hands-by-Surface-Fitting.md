##### Abstract
This paper introduces a framework to plan grasps with multi-fingered hands. The framework includes a multi-dimensional iterative surface fitting (MDISF) for grasp planning and a grasp trajectory optimization (GTO) for grasp imagination. The MDISF algorithm searches for optimal contact regions and hand configurations by minimizing the collision and surface fitting error, and the GTO algorithm generates optimal finger trajectories to reach the highly ranked grasp configurations and avoid collision with the environment. The proposed grasp planning and imagination framework considers the collision avoidance and the kinematics of the hand-robot system, and is able to plan grasps and trajectories of different categories efficiently with gradient-based methods using the captured point cloud. The found grasps and trajectories are robust to sensing noises and underlying uncertainties. The effectiveness of the proposed framework is verified by both simulations and experiments.
