##### Abstract
In this work, we address two coupled tasks of gaze prediction and action recognition in egocentric videos by exploring their mutual context. Our assumption is that in the procedure of performing a manipulation task, what a person is doing determines where the person is looking at, and the gaze point reveals gaze and non-gaze regions which contain important and complementary information about the undergoing action. We propose a novel mutual context network (MCN) that jointly learns action-dependent gaze prediction and gaze-guided action recognition in an end-to-end manner. Experiments on public egocentric video datasets demonstrate that our MCN achieves state-of-the-art performance of both gaze prediction and action recognition.
