##### Abstract
In this paper, an image denoising algorithm is proposed for salt and pepper noise. First, a generative model is built on a patch as a basic unit and then the algorithm locates the image noise within that patch in order to better describe the patch and obtain better subsequent clustering. Second, the algorithm classifies patches using a generative clustering method, thus providing additional similarity information for noise repair and suppressing the interference of noise, abandoning those categories that consist of a smaller number of patches. Finally, the algorithm builds a non-local switching filter to remove the salt and pepper noise. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm effectively denoises salt and pepper noise of various densities. It obtains a better visual quality and higher peak signal-to-noise ratio score than several state-of-the-art algorithms. In short, our algorithm uses a noisy patch as the basic unit, a patch clustering method to optimize the repair data set as well as obtain a better denoising effect, and provides a guideline for future denoising and repair methods.

本文提出了一种用于椒盐噪声的图像去噪算法。首先，生成模型建立在补丁作为基本单元，然后算法定位该补丁内的图像噪声，以便更好地描述补丁并获得更好的后续聚类。其次，该算法使用生成聚类方法对补丁进行分类，从而为噪声修复和抑制噪声干扰提供额外的相似性信息，放弃由较少数量的补丁组成的那些类别。最后，该算法构建了一个非局部切换滤波器，以消除盐和胡椒噪声。仿真结果表明，该算法能有效地去除各种密度的椒盐噪声。与几种最先进的算法相比，它获得了更好的视觉质量和更高的峰值信噪比得分。简而言之，我们的算法使用噪声补丁作为基本单元，一种补丁聚类方法来优化修复数据集以及获得更好的去噪效果，并为将来的去噪和修复方法提供指导。
