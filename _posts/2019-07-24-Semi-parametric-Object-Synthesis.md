##### Abstract
We present a new semi-parametric approach to synthesize novel views of an object from a single monocular image. First, we exploit man-made object symmetry and piece-wise planarity to integrate rich a-priori visual information into the novel viewpoint synthesis process. An Image Completion Network (ICN) then leverages 2.5D sketches rendered from a 3D CAD as guidance to generate a realistic image. In contrast to concurrent works, we do not rely solely on synthetic data but leverage instead existing datasets for 3D object detection to operate in a real-world scenario. Differently from competitors, our semi-parametric framework allows the handling of a wide range of 3D transformations. Thorough experimental analysis against state-of-the-art baselines shows the efficacy of our method both from a quantitative and a perceptive point of view.
