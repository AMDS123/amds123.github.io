##### Abstract
The state-of-the-art of face recognition has been significantly advanced by the emergence of deep learning. Very deep neural networks recently achieved great success on general object recognition because of their superb learning capacity. This motivates us to investigate their effectiveness on face recognition. This paper proposes two very deep neural network architectures, referred to as DeepID3, for face recognition. These two architectures are rebuilt from stacked convolution and inception layers proposed in VGG net and GoogLeNet to make them suitable to face recognition. Joint face identification-verification supervisory signals are added to both intermediate and final feature extraction layers during training. An ensemble of the proposed two architectures achieves 99.53% LFW face verification accuracy and 96.0% LFW rank-1 face identification accuracy, respectively. A further discussion of LFW face verification result is given in the end.

深度学习的出现，使得人脸识别技术发展显着。最近很深的神经网络由于其极好的学习能力而在通用目标识别方面取得了巨大的成功。这激励我们调查他们在面部识别上的有效性。本文提出了两种深度神经网络架构，称为DeepID3，用于人脸识别。这两个体系结构是从VGG网络和GoogLeNet中提出的堆叠卷积和起始层重建的，使它们适合面对识别。在训练期间，将联合人脸识别 - 验证监督信号添加到中间和最终特征提取层。所提出的两种体系结构的集合分别实现了99.53％的LFW人脸验证准确性和96.0％的LFW一级人脸识别准确性。最后给出了LFW人脸验证结果的进一步讨论。
