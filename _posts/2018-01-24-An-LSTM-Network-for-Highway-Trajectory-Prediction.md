##### Abstract
In order to drive safely and efficiently on public roads, autonomous vehicles will have to understand the intentions of surrounding vehicles, and adapt their own behavior accordingly. If experienced human drivers are generally good at inferring other vehicles' motion up to a few seconds in the future, most current Advanced Driving Assistance Systems (ADAS) are unable to perform such medium-term forecasts, and are usually limited to high-likelihood situations such as emergency braking. In this article, we present a first step towards consistent trajectory prediction by introducing a long short-term memory (LSTM) neural network, which is capable of accurately predicting future longitudinal and lateral trajectories for vehicles on highway. Unlike previous work focusing on a low number of trajectories collected from a few drivers, our network was trained and validated on the NGSIM US-101 dataset, which contains a total of 800 hours of recorded trajectories in various traffic densities, representing more than 6000 individual drivers.

为了在公路上安全有效地驾驶，自动驾驶车辆必须了解周围车辆的意图，并相应地调整自己的行为。如果有经验的驾驶员通常善于推测其他车辆在未来几秒钟内的动作，那么目前的先进驾驶辅助系统（ADAS）不能执行这样的中期预测，并且通常仅限于高可能性情况如紧急制动。在本文中，我们通过引入长期短期记忆（LSTM）神经网络来展示一致的轨迹预测的第一步，该网络能够准确预测未来高速公路上的车辆纵向和侧向轨迹。与以前的工作重点是从少数驾驶员收集少量轨迹，我们的网络在NGSIM US-101数据集上进行了培训和验证，该数据集包含800小时不同交通密度的记录轨迹，代表6000多个人驱动程序。
