##### Abstract
Since 2010 IceCube observed around 50 high-energy neutrino events of cosmic origin above 60 TeV, but the astrophysical sources of these events are still unknown. We recently proposed high-energy emitting BL Lac (HBL) objects as candidate emitters of high-energy neutrinos. Assuming a direct proportionality between high-energy gamma-ray and very-high energy neutrino fluxes, we calculated the expected neutrino event number in a year for IceCube and the presently under construction Km3NeT. To give a value of the significance of a detection we considered also the background for the single sources. To this aim we derived the through-going muon rate, generated by muon neutrino including the effect of Earth absorption, the density of the Earth and the cross section $\nu N$. Applying this calculation both to HBL sources and the atmospherical neutrino background, we can calculate the expected significance of the detection by IceCube, showing that our scenario is compatible with a no detection of HBL.
