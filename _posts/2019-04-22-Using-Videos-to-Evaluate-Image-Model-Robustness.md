##### Abstract
Human visual systems are robust to a wide range of image transformations that are challenging for artificial networks. We present the first study of image model robustness to the minute transformations found across video frames, which we term "natural robustness". Compared to previous studies on adversarial examples and synthetic distortions, natural robustness captures a more diverse set of common image transformations that occur in the natural environment. Our study across a dozen model architectures shows that more accurate models are more robust to natural transformations, and that robustness to synthetic color distortions is a good proxy for natural robustness. In examining brittleness in videos, we find that majority of the brittleness found in videos lies outside the typical definition of adversarial examples (99.9\%). Finally, we investigate training techniques to reduce brittleness and find that no single technique systematically improves natural robustness across twelve tested architectures.
