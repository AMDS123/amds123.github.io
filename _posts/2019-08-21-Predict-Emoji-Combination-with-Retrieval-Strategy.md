##### Abstract
As emojis are widely used in social media, people not only use an emoji to express their emotions or mention things but also extend its usage to represent complicate emotions, concepts or activities by combining multiple emojis. In this work, we study how emoji combination, a consecutive emoji sequence, is used like a new language. We propose a novel algorithm called Retrieval Strategy to predict what emoji combination follows given a short text as context. Our algorithm treats emoji combinations as phrase in language, ranking sets of emoji combinations like retrieving words from dictionary. We show that our algorithm largely improves the F1 score from 0.141 to 0.204 on emoji combination prediction task.
