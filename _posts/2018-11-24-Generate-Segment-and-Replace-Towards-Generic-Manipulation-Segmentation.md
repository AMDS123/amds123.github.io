##### Abstract
It has been witnessed an emerging demand for image manipulation segmentation to distinguish between fake images produced by advanced photo editing software and authentic ones. In this paper, we describe an approach based on semantic segmentation for detecting image manipulation. The approach consists of three stages. A generation stage generates hard manipulated images from authentic images using a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) based model by cutting a region out of a training sample, pasting it into an authentic image and then passing the image through a GAN to generate harder true positive tampered region. A segmentation stage and a replacement stage, sharing weights with each other, then collaboratively construct dense predictions of tampered regions. We achieve state-of-the-art performance on four public image manipulation detection benchmarks while maintaining robustness to various attacks.
