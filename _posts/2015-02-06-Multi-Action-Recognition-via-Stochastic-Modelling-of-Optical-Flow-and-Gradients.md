##### Abstract
In this paper we propose a novel approach to multi-action recognition that performs joint segmentation and classification. This approach models each action using a Gaussian mixture using robust low-dimensional action features. Segmentation is achieved by performing classification on overlapping temporal windows, which are then merged to produce the final result. This approach is considerably less complicated than previous methods which use dynamic programming or computationally expensive hidden Markov models (HMMs). Initial experiments on a stitched version of the KTH dataset show that the proposed approach achieves an accuracy of 78.3%, outperforming a recent HMM-based approach which obtained 71.2%.

在本文中，我们提出了一种新的多动作识别方法，执行联合分割和分类。这种方法使用强健的低维动作特征使用高斯混合对每个动作进行建模。分割是通过对重叠的时间窗口进行分类来实现的，然后合并以产生最终结果。这种方法比使用动态编程或计算上昂贵的隐马尔可夫模型（HMM）的先前方法复杂得多。在KTH数据集的拼接版本上的初始实验显示，所提出的方法达到了78.3％的准确度，优于最近基于HMM的方法，其获得了71.2％。
