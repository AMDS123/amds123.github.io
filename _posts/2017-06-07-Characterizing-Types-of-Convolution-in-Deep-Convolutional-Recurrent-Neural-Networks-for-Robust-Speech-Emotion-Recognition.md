##### Abstract
Deep convolutional neural networks are being actively investigated in a wide range of speech and audio processing applications including speech recognition, audio event detection and computational paralinguistics, owing to their ability to reduce factors of variations, such as speaker and environment information in signals, for speech recognition. However, studies have suggested to favor a certain type of convolutional operations when building a deep convolutional neural network for speech applications although there has been promising results using different types of convolutional operations. In this work, we study four types of convolutional operations on different input features for speech emotion recognition in order to derive a comprehensive understanding. Since affective behavioral information has been shown to reflect temporally varying of mental state and convolutional operation are applied locally in time, all deep neural networks share a deep recurrent sub-network architecture for further temporal modeling. We present detailed quantitative module-wise performance analysis to gain insights into information flows within the proposed architectures. In particular, we demonstrate the interplay of affective information and the other irrelevant information during the progression from one module to another. Finally we show that all of our deep neural networks provide state-of-the-art performance on the eNTERFACE'05 corpus.

深卷积神经网络正在被广泛的语音和音频处理应用（包括语音识别，音频事件检测和计算语言学）中进行积极的研究，这是因为它们能够减少变化因素，例如说话人和环境信息，语音承认。然而，研究表明当构建用于语音应用的深度卷积神经网络时，某种类型的卷积操作是有利的，尽管使用不同类型的卷积操作已经有了令人鼓舞的结果。在这项工作中，我们研究了四种不同的输入特征的语音情感识别的卷积运算，以获得全面的理解。由于情感行为信息已经被证明反映了精神状态的时间变化，并且卷积操作在时间上被局部地应用，所有深度神经网络共享一个深度复发的子网络架构，用于进一步的时间建模。我们提供详细的定量模块化性能分析，以深入了解所提出体系结构中的信息流。特别是，我们展示了从一个模块到另一个模块的过程中情感信息和其他不相关信息的相互作用。最后，我们展示了我们所有的深层神经网络在eNTERFACE'05语料库上提供了最先进的性能。
