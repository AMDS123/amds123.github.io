##### Abstract
Deep neural networks provide unprecedented performance in all image classification problems, leveraging the availability of huge amounts of data for training. Recent studies, however, have shown their vulnerability to adversarial attacks, spawning an intense research effort in this field. With the aim of building better systems, new countermeasures and stronger attacks are proposed by the day. On the attacker's side, there is growing interest for the realistic black-box scenario, in which the user has no access to the neural network parameters. The problem is to design limited-complexity attacks which mislead the neural network without impairing image quality too much, not to raise the attention of human observers. In this work, we put special emphasis on this latter requirement and propose a powerful and low-complexity black-box attack which preserves perceptual image quality. Numerical experiments prove the effectiveness of the proposed techniques both for tasks commonly considered in this context, and for other applications in biometrics (face recognition) and forensics (camera model identification).
