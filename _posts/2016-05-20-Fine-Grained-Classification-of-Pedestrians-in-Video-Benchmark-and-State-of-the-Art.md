##### Abstract
A video dataset that is designed to study fine-grained categorisation of pedestrians is introduced. Pedestrians were recorded "in-the-wild" from a moving vehicle. Annotations include bounding boxes, tracks, 14 keypoints with occlusion information and the fine-grained categories of age (5 classes), sex (2 classes), weight (3 classes) and clothing style (4 classes). There are a total of 27,454 bounding box and pose labels across 4222 tracks. This dataset is designed to train and test algorithms for fine-grained categorisation of people, it is also useful for benchmarking tracking, detection and pose estimation of pedestrians. State-of-the-art algorithms for fine-grained classification and pose estimation were tested using the dataset and the results are reported as a useful performance baseline.

介绍一个视频数据集，旨在研究细粒度的行人分类。行人是从行驶中的车辆“野外”记录下来的。注释包括边界框，轨迹，14个关键点，包含遮挡信息和年龄（5班），性别（2班），体重（3班）和服装风格（4班）的细粒度类别。在4222个轨道上共有27,454个边界框和姿态标签。该数据集旨在训练和测试人类细粒度分类算法，对行人的跟踪，检测和姿态估计的基准测试也很有用。使用数据集测试了用于细粒度分类和姿态估计的最新算法，并将结果报告为有用的性能基线。
