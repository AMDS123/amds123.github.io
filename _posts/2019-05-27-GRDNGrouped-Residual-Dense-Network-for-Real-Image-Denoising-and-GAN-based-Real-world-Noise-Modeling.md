##### Abstract
Recent research on image denoising has progressed with the development of deep learning architectures, especially convolutional neural networks. However, real-world image denoising is still very challenging because it is not possible to obtain ideal pairs of ground-truth images and real-world noisy images. Owing to the recent release of benchmark datasets, the interest of the image denoising community is now moving toward the real-world denoising problem. In this paper, we propose a grouped residual dense network (GRDN), which is an extended and generalized architecture of the state-of-the-art residual dense network (RDN). The core part of RDN is defined as grouped residual dense block (GRDB) and used as a building module of GRDN. We experimentally show that the image denoising performance can be significantly improved by cascading GRDBs. In addition to the network architecture design, we also develop a new generative adversarial network-based real-world noise modeling method. We demonstrate the superiority of the proposed methods by achieving the highest score in terms of both the peak signal-to-noise ratio and the structural similarity in the NTIRE2019 Real Image Denoising Challenge - Track 2:sRGB.
