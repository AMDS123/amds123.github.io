##### Abstract
The recently released AlphaZero algorithm achieves superhuman performance in the games of chess, shogi and Go, which raises two open questions. Firstly, as there is a finite number of possibilities in the game, is there a quantifiable intelligence measurement for evaluating intelligent systems like AlphaZero? Secondly, AlphaZero introduces sophisticated reinforcement learning and self-play to efficiently encode the possible states, is there a simple information-theoretic model to represent the learning process and offer more insights? 
 This paper explores the above two questions by proposing a simple variance of Shannon's communication model, the concept of intelligence entropy and the Unified Intelligence-Communication Model is proposed, which provide an information-theoretic metric for investigating the intelligence level and also provide an bound for intelligent agents in the form of Shannon's capacity, namely, the intelligence capacity. This paper then applies the concept and model to AlphaZero as a case study and explains the learning process of intelligent agent as turbo-like iterative decoding, so that the learning performance of AlphaZero may be quantitatively evaluated. Finally, conclusions are provided along with theoretical and practical remarks.
