##### Abstract
Many people use Yelp to find a good restaurant. Nonetheless, with only an overall rating for each restaurant, Yelp offers not enough information for independently judging its various aspects such as environment, service or flavor. In this paper, we introduced a machine learning based method to characterize such aspects for particular types of restaurants. The main approach used in this paper is to use a support vector machine (SVM) model to decipher the sentiment tendency of each review from word frequency. Word scores generated from the SVM models are further processed into a polarity index indicating the significance of each word for special types of restaurant. Customers overall tend to express more sentiment regarding service. As for the distinction between different cuisines, results that match the common sense are obtained: Japanese cuisines are usually fresh, some French cuisines are overpriced while Italian Restaurants are often famous for their pizzas.

##### Abstract (translated by Google)
许多人使用Yelp找到一家好的餐馆。尽管如此，Yelp对于每家餐厅只有一个整体评分，没有提供足够的信息来独立判断其环境，服务或风味等各个方面。在本文中，我们引入了一种基于机器学习的方法来描述特定类型的餐馆的这些方面。本文采用的主要方法是使用支持向量机（SVM）模型来解读每个评论从词频的情感倾向。支持向量机模型生成的单词分数进一步处理成极性指数，指示每个单词对于特殊类型餐厅的重要性。客户总体倾向于表达更多的服务意识。至于不同菜系之间的区别，可以得出与常识相符的结果：日本料理通常是新鲜的，一些法国料理被高估了，而意大利餐馆往往以比萨饼闻名。
