##### Abstract
In most computer vision and image analysis problems, it is necessary to define a similarity measure between two or more different objects or images. Template matching is a classic and fundamental method used to score similarities between objects using certain mathematical algorithms. In this paper, we reviewed the basic concept of matching, as well as advances in template matching and applications such as invariant features or novel applications in medical image analysis. Additionally, deformable models and templates originating from classic template matching were discussed. These models have broad applications in image registration, and they are a fundamental aspect of novel machine vision or deep learning algorithms, such as convolutional neural networks (CNN), which perform shift and scale invariant functions followed by classification. In general, although template matching methods have restrictions which limit their application, they are recommended for use with other object recognition methods as pre- or post-processing steps. Combining a template matching technique such as normalized cross-correlation or dice coefficient with a robust decision-making algorithm yields a significant improvement in the accuracy rate for object detection and recognition.

在大多数计算机视觉和图像分析问题中，有必要定义两个或更多不同对象或图像之间的相似性度量。模板匹配是使用某些数学算法来评估对象之间相似性的经典和基本方法。在本文中，我们回顾了匹配的基本概念，以及模板匹配和应用程序（如不变特征或新的应用程序）在医学图像分析中的进步。另外还讨论了源自经典模板匹配的可变形模型和模板。这些模型在图像配准中有广泛的应用，它们是新型机器视觉或深度学习算法（如卷积神经网络（CNN））的一个基本方面，卷积神经网络执行移位和尺度不变函数，然后进行分类。通常，尽管模板匹配方法有限制其应用的限制，但是推荐将其用于其他目标识别方法作为预处理或后处理步骤。将模板匹配技术（如归一化互相关或模子系数）与鲁棒决策算法相结合，可以显着提高对象检测和识别的准确率。
