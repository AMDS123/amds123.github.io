##### Abstract
Saving rainforests is a key to halting adverse climate changes. In this paper, we introduce an innovative solution built on acoustic surveillance and machine learning technologies to help rainforest conservation. In particular, We propose new convolutional neural network (CNN) models for environmental sound classification and achieved promising preliminary results on two datasets, including a public audio dataset and our real rainforest sound dataset. The proposed audio classification models can be easily extended in an automated machine learning paradigm and integrated in cloud-based services for real world deployment.
