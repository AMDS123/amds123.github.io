##### Abstract
The work presents two algorithms of manipulation and comparison between strings whose purpose is the orthographic recognition of the apostrophe and of the compound expressions. The theory supporting general reasoning refers to the basic concept of EditDistance, the improvements that ensure the achievement of the objective are achieved with the aid of tools borrowed from the use of techniques for processing large amounts of data on distributed platforms.
