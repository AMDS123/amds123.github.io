##### Abstract
Deep learning has shown promising results on many machine learning tasks but DL models are often complex networks with large number of neurons and layers, and recently, complex layer structures known as building blocks. Finding the best deep model requires a combination of finding both the right architecture and the correct set of parameters appropriate for that architecture. In addition, this complexity (in terms of layer types, number of neurons, and number of layers) also present problems with generalization since larger networks are easier to overfit to the data. In this paper, we propose a search framework for finding effective architectural building blocks for convolutional neural networks (CNN). Our approach is much faster at finding models that are close to state-of-the-art in performance. In addition, the models discovered by our approach are also smaller than models discovered by similar techniques. We achieve these twin advantages by designing our search space in such a way that it searches over a reduced set of state-of-the-art building blocks for CNNs including residual block, inception block, inception-residual block, ResNeXt block and many others. We apply this technique to generate models for multiple image datasets and show that these models achieve performance comparable to state-of-the-art (and even surpassing the state-of-the-art in one case). We also show that learned models are transferable between datasets.

深度学习在许多机器学习任务中已经显示出有希望的结果，但是DL模型通常是具有大量神经元和层的复杂网络，并且最近有复杂的层结构被称为构建块。寻找最好的深度模型需要结合寻找合适的体系结构和适合该体系结构的正确参数集。另外，这种复杂性（在图层类型，神经元数量和图层数量方面）也存在泛化的问题，因为较大的网络更容易过度适应数据。在本文中，我们提出了一个用于查找卷积神经网络（CNN）的有效建筑模块的搜索框架。我们的方法在寻找性能接近最先进的模型方面要快得多。此外，我们的方法发现的模型也比类似技术发现的模型小。我们通过设计我们的搜索空间来实现这些双重优势，使得它能够搜索CNN中最先进的构建块的简化集合，包括残差块，初始块，初始残差块，ResNeXt块和其他许多块。我们应用这种技术来生成多个图像数据集的模型，并显示这些模型的性能可与现有技术相媲美（甚至在一种情况下超越现有技术水平）。我们还显示，学习模型可以在数据集之间转换。
