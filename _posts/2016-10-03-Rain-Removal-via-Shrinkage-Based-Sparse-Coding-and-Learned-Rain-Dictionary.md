##### Abstract
This paper introduces a new rain removal model based on the shrinkage of the sparse codes for a single image. Recently, dictionary learning and sparse coding have been widely used for image restoration problems. These methods can also be applied to the rain removal by learning two types of rain and non-rain dictionaries and forcing the sparse codes of the rain dictionary to be zero vectors. However, this approach can generate unwanted edge artifacts and detail loss in the non-rain regions. Based on this observation, a new approach for shrinking the sparse codes is presented in this paper. To effectively shrink the sparse codes in the rain and non-rain regions, an error map between the input rain image and the reconstructed rain image is generated by using the learned rain dictionary. Based on this error map, both the sparse codes of rain and non-rain dictionaries are used jointly to represent the image structures of objects and avoid the edge artifacts in the non-rain regions. In the rain regions, the correlation matrix between the rain and non-rain dictionaries is calculated. Then, the sparse codes corresponding to the highly correlated signal-atoms in the rain and non-rain dictionaries are shrunk jointly to improve the removal of the rain structures. The experimental results show that the proposed shrinkage-based sparse coding can preserve image structures and avoid the edge artifacts in the non-rain regions, and it can remove the rain structures in the rain regions. Also, visual quality evaluation confirms that the proposed method outperforms the conventional texture and rain removal methods.

本文介绍了一种基于单幅图​​像稀疏编码缩小的新型降雨模型。最近，字典学习和稀疏编码已被广泛用于图像恢复问题。这些方法也可以通过学习两种雨型和非雨型字典来应用于降雨，迫使雨字典的稀疏编码为零向量。但是，这种方法会在非雨区产生不希望的边缘伪影和细节损失。基于此观点，本文提出了一种缩减稀疏编码的新方法。为了有效缩小雨区和非雨区的稀疏编码，利用学习雨量词典生成输入雨图和重构雨图之间的误差图。在此误差图的基础上，联合使用雨与非雨的词典的稀疏编码来表示物体的图像结构，避免非雨区的边缘伪影。在雨区，计算了雨与非雨的词典之间的相关矩阵。然后，将降雨和非降雨词典中高度相关的信号原子对应的稀疏码联合收缩，以改善雨水结构的去除。实验结果表明，提出的基于收缩的稀疏编码可以保留图像结构，避免非雨区的边缘伪影，可以去除雨区雨水结构。此外，视觉质量评估证实了所提出的方法优于传统的纹理和雨水去除方法。
