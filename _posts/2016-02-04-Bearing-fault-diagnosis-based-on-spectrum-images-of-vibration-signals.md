##### Abstract
Bearing fault diagnosis has been a challenge in the monitoring activities of rotating machinery, and it's receiving more and more attention. The conventional fault diagnosis methods usually extract features from the waveforms or spectrums of vibration signals in order to realize fault classification. In this paper, a novel feature in the form of images is presented, namely the spectrum images of vibration signals. The spectrum images are simply obtained by doing fast Fourier transformation. Such images are processed with two-dimensional principal component analysis (2DPCA) to reduce the dimensions, and then a minimum distance method is applied to classify the faults of bearings. The effectiveness of the proposed method is verified with experimental data.

轴承故障诊断一直是旋转机械监测工作面临的一个挑战，越来越受到重视。传统的故障诊断方法通常从振动信号的波形或频谱中提取特征来实现故障分类。本文提出了一种图像形式的新特征，即振动信号的频谱图像。光谱图像通过快速傅里叶变换简单地获得。利用二维主成分分析（2DPCA）对图像进行处理以减小尺寸，然后采用最小距离法对轴承故障进行分类。实验数据验证了所提方法的有效性。
