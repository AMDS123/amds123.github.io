##### Abstract
Datasets that boosted state-of-the-art solutions for Question Answering (QA) systems prove that it is possible to ask questions in natural language manner. However, users are still used to query-like systems where they type in keywords to search for answer. In this study we validate which parts of questions are essential for obtaining valid answer. In order to conclude that, we take advantage of LIME - a framework that explains prediction by local approximation. We find that grammar and natural language is disregarded by QA. State-of-the-art model can answer properly even if 'asked' only with a few words with high coefficients calculated with LIME. According to our knowledge, it is the first time that QA model is being explained by LIME.

为问答（QA）系统提供最先进解决方案的数据集证明，可以用自然语言方式提问。但是，用户仍然习惯于类似查询的系统，他们键入关键字来搜索答案。在本研究中，我们验证哪些部分的问题对于获得有效答案至关重要。为了得出结论，我们利用了LIME--一个通过局部近似解释预测的框架。我们发现QA无视语法和自然语言。最先进的模型可以正确回答，即使只是用“LIME”计算的高系数的几个单词“询问”。据我们所知，这是LIME首次解释质量保证模型。
