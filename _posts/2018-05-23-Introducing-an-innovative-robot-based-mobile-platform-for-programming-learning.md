##### Abstract
The present study introduces an Android based application that focuses on promoting students' learning experience when interacting with Lego Mindstorms Robotic Kit NXT. A thorough investigation of the current literature reveals that there are numerous applications attempting to overcome the limitations of Lego platform which, however, appear to only partially succeed in significantly improving children's engagement in fruitful learning. Their main limitations are that they either function on an elemental level or suffer from a general lack of creating effectively room for children to test their abilities and other curiosities. Aiming at confronting these limitations, the proposed android application, which is referred to as MyNXT, was created and presented. MyNXT offers direct access control along with the choice to program using simple linear logic through an easy and a user friendly environment with built in instructions for all ages. Concluding, the proposed application constitutes a stepping to an educating platform, which can facilitate the learning needs of children in contemporary times.

本研究介绍了一个基于Android的应用程序，该应用程序着重于在与乐高Mindstorms机器人工具箱NXT交互时促进学生的学习体验。对当前文献进行彻底调查发现，有许多应用试图克服乐高平台的局限性，然而，这似乎仅部分地成功地显着改善了儿童参与卓有成效的学习。他们的主要局限在于，他们要么在基本层面上运作，要么缺乏为儿童创造有效空间来测试他们的能力和其他好奇心。旨在面对这些限制，创建并呈现提议的android应用程序，其被称为MyNXT。 MyNXT提供直接访问控制，以及使用简单的线性逻辑进行编程的选择，通过简单和用户友好的环境，并为所有年龄的内置指令。总而言之，拟议的应用程序构成了迈向教育平台的步伐，可以促进当代儿童的学习需求。
