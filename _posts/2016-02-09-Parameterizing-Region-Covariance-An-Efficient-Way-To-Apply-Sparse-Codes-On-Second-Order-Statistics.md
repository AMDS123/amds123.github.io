##### Abstract
Sparse representations have been successfully applied to signal processing, computer vision and machine learning. Currently there is a trend to learn sparse models directly on structure data, such as region covariance. However, such methods when combined with region covariance often require complex computation. We present an approach to transform a structured sparse model learning problem to a traditional vectorized sparse modeling problem by constructing a Euclidean space representation for region covariance matrices. Our new representation has multiple advantages. Experiments on several vision tasks demonstrate competitive performance with the state-of-the-art methods.

稀疏表示已被成功应用于信号处理，计算机视觉和机器学习。目前有一种趋势是直接在结构数据上学习稀疏模型，如区域协方差。但是，这种方法与区域协方差结合时往往需要复杂的计算。我们提出了一种通过构造区域协方差矩阵的欧几里得空间表示来将结构化稀疏模型学习问题转换成传统的矢量化稀疏建模问题的方法。我们的新代表有多重优势。几项视觉任务的实验证明了最先进的方法具有竞争力的表现。
