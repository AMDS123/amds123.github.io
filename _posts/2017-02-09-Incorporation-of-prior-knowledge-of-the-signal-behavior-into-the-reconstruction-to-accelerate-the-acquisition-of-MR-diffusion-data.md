##### Abstract
Diffusion MRI measurements using hyperpolarized gases are generally acquired during patient breath hold, which yields a compromise between achievable image resolution, lung coverage and number of b-values. In this work, we propose a novel method that accelerates the acquisition of MR diffusion data by undersampling in both spatial and b-value dimensions, thanks to incorporating knowledge about the signal decay into the reconstruction (SIDER). SIDER is compared to total variation (TV) reconstruction by assessing their effect on both the recovery of ventilation images and estimated mean alveolar dimensions (MAD). Both methods are assessed by retrospectively undersampling diffusion datasets of normal volunteers and COPD patients (n=8) for acceleration factors between x2 and x10. TV led to large errors and artefacts for acceleration factors equal or larger than x5. SIDER improved TV, presenting lower errors and histograms of MAD closer to those obtained from fully sampled data for accelerations factors up to x10. SIDER preserved image quality at all acceleration factors but images were slightly smoothed and some details were lost at x10. In conclusion, we have developed and validated a novel compressed sensing method for lung MRI imaging and achieved high acceleration factors, which can be used to increase the amount of data acquired during a breath-hold. This methodology is expected to improve the accuracy of estimated lung microstructure dimensions and widen the possibilities of studying lung diseases with MRI.

使用超极化气体的扩散MRI测量通常在患者屏气期间获得，这在可获得的图像分辨率，肺覆盖率和b值数量之间产生折衷。在这项工作中，我们提出了一种新颖的方法，通过在空间和b值维度上欠采样来加速获取MR扩散数据，这归功于将信号衰减的知识纳入重建（SIDER）。通过评估其对通气图像的恢复和估计的平均肺泡尺寸（MAD）的影响，将SIDER与总变异（TV）重建进行比较。通过对正常志愿者和COPD患者（n = 8）的扩散数据集进行回溯性欠采样，评估两种方法的x2和x10之间的加速因子。电视机导致大的误差和加速因素等于或大于x5的人为因素。 SIDER改进了电视，提供了更接近从完整采样数据获得的加速因子达到x10的更低的误差和直方图。 SIDER在所有的加速因子下保留了图像质量，但是图像略微平滑，并且在x10处丢失了一些细节。总之，我们已经开发和验证了一种新的用于肺部MRI成像的压缩感测方法，并且获得了很高的加速因子，可以用来增加在屏住呼吸期间获得的数据量。预计这种方法将提高估计的肺微结构尺寸的准确性，并扩大用MRI研究肺疾病的可能性。
