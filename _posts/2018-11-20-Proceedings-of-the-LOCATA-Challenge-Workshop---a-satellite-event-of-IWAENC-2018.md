##### Abstract
Algorithms for acoustic source localization and tracking provide estimates of the positional information about active sound sources in acoustic environments and are essential for a wide range of applications such as personal assistants, smart homes, tele-conferencing systems, hearing aids, or autonomous systems. The aim of the IEEE-AASP Challenge on sound source localization and tracking (LOCATA) was to objectively benchmark state-of-the-art localization and tracking algorithms using an open-access data corpus of recordings for scenarios typically encountered in audio and acoustic signal processing applications. The challenge tasks ranged from the localization of a single source with a static microphone array to the tracking of multiple moving sources with a moving microphone array.
