##### Abstract
Application of decision support systems for conflict modeling in information operations recognition is presented. An information operation is considered as a complex weakly structured system. The model of conflict between two subjects is proposed based on the second-order rank reflexive model. The method is described for construction of the design pattern for knowledge bases of decision support systems. In the talk, the methodology is proposed for using of decision support systems for modeling of conflicts in information operations recognition based on the use of expert knowledge and content monitoring.
