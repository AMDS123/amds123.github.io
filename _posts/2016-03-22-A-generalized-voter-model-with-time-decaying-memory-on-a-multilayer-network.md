##### Abstract
By incorporating a multilayer network and time-decaying memory into the original voter model, the coupled effects of spatial and temporal cumulation of peer pressure on consensus are investigated. Heterogeneity in peer pressure and time-decaying mechanism are both found to be detrimental to consensus. The transition points, below which a consensus can always be reached and above which two opposed opinions are more likely to coexist, are found. A mean-field analysis indicates that the phase transitions in the present model are governed by the cumulative influence of peer pressure and the updating threshold. A functional relation between the consensus threshold and the decaying rate of the influence of peer pressure is found. As to the time to reach a consensus, it is governed by the coupling of the memory length and the decaying rate. An intermediate decaying rate may lead to much lower time to reach a consensus.

通过将多层网络和时间衰减记忆纳入原始选民模型，研究同伴压力的空间和时间累积对共识的耦合效应。同伴压力的异质性和时间衰减机制都被认为是不利于共识的。在这个过渡点之下，总是可以达成一致意见，而在这个意见之上，两种反对意见可能会共存。平均场分析表明，本模型中的相变受同伴压力和更新阈值的累积影响的支配。找到了共识阈值与同伴压力影响衰退率之间的函数关系。至于达成共识的时间，是由内存长度和衰减率的耦合所决定的。中间的衰减率可能导致达成共识的时间要短得多。
