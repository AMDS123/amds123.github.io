##### Abstract
This short paper provides a description of an architecture to acquisition and use of knowledge by intelligent agents over a restricted domain of the Internet Infrastructure. The proposed architecture is added to an intelligent agent deployment model over a very useful server for Internet Autonomous System administrators. Such servers, which are heavily dependent on arbitrary and eventual updates of human beings, become unreliable. This is a position paper that proposes three research questions that are still in progress.

这篇简短的论文描述了智能代理通过互联网基础设施的受限领域获取和使用知识的体系结构。建议的体系结构通过非常有用的Internet自治系统管理员服务器添加到智能代理部署模型。这些服务器严重依赖于人为的任意更新，并且变得不可靠。这是一份立论文件，提出了三个仍在进行中的研究问题。
