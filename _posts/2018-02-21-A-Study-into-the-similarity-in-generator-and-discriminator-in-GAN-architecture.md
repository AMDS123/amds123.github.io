##### Abstract
One popular generative model that has high-quality results is the Generative Adversarial Networks(GAN). This type of architecture consists of two separate networks that play against each other. The generator creates an output from the input noise that is given to it. The discriminator has the task of determining if the input to it is real or fake. This takes place constantly eventually leads to the generator modeling the target distribution. This paper includes a study into the actual weights learned by the network and a study into the similarity of the discriminator and generator networks. The paper also tries to leverage the similarity between these networks and shows that indeed both the networks may have a similar structure with experimental evidence with a novel shared architecture.

生成敌对网络（GAN）是一种具有高质量结果的流行生成模型。这种类型的体系结构由两个独立的网络组成，这两个网络相互对抗。发生器根据给定的输入噪声创建一个输出。鉴别器的任务是确定它的输入是真实的还是假的。这不断发生，最终导致发电机建模目标分布。本文包括对网络学习到的实际权重的研究，以及对鉴别器和发生器网络相似性的研究。该论文还试图利用这些网络之间的相似性，并且表明实际上两个网络可能具有与具有新颖共享架构的实验证据相似的结构。
