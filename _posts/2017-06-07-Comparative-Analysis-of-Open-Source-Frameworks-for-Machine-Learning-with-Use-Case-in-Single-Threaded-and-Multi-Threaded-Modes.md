##### Abstract
The basic features of some of the most versatile and popular open source frameworks for machine learning (TensorFlow, Deep Learning4j, and H2O) are considered and compared. Their comparative analysis was performed and conclusions were made as to the advantages and disadvantages of these platforms. The performance tests for the de facto standard MNIST data set were carried out on H2O framework for deep learning algorithms designed for CPU and GPU platforms for single-threaded and multithreaded modes of operation.

##### Abstract (translated by Google)
考虑并比较了一些最通用和流行的机器学习开放框架（TensorFlow，Deep Learning4j和H2O）的基本特征。他们进行了比较分析，并就这些平台的优缺点作出结论。事实上的标准MNIST数据集的性能测试是在用于单线程和多线程操作模式的CPU和GPU平台的深度学习算法的H2O框架上进行的。
