##### Abstract
Zero-shot learning (ZSL) is a framework to classify images belonging to unseen classes based on solely semantic information about these unseen classes. In this paper, we propose a new ZSL algorithm using coupled dictionary learning. The core idea is that the visual features and the semantic attributes of an image can share the same sparse representation in an intermediate space. We use images from seen classes and semantic attributes from seen and unseen classes to learn two dictionaries that can represent sparsely the visual and semantic feature vectors of an image. In the ZSL testing stage and in the absence of labeled data, images from unseen classes can be mapped into the attribute space by finding the joint sparse representation using solely the visual data. The image is then classified in the attribute space given semantic descriptions of unseen classes. We also provide an attribute-aware formulation to tackle domain shift and hubness problems in ZSL. Extensive experiments are provided to demonstrate the superior performance of our approach against the state of the art ZSL algorithms on benchmark ZSL datasets.
