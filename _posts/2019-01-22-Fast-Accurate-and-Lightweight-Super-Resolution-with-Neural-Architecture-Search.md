##### Abstract
Deep convolution neural networks demonstrate impressive results in super-resolution domain. An ocean of researches concentrate on improving peak signal noise ratio (PSNR) by using deeper and deeper layers, which is not friendly to constrained resources. Pursuing a trade-off between restoration capacity and simplicity of a model is still non-trivial by now. Recently, more contributions are devoted to this balance and our work is focusing on improving it further with automatic neural architecture search. In this paper, we handle super-resolution using multi-objective approach and propose an elastic search method involving both macro and micro aspects based on a hybrid controller of evolutionary algorithm and reinforcement learning. Quantitative experiments can help to draw a conclusion that the models generated by our methods are very competitive than and even dominate most of state-of-the-art super-resolution methods with different levels of FLOPS.
