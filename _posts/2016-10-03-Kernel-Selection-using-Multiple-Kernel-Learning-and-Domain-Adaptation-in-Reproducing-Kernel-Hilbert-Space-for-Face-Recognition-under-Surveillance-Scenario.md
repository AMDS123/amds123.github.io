##### Abstract
Face Recognition (FR) has been the interest to several researchers over the past few decades due to its passive nature of biometric authentication. Despite high accuracy achieved by face recognition algorithms under controlled conditions, achieving the same performance for face images obtained in surveillance scenarios, is a major hurdle. Some attempts have been made to super-resolve the low-resolution face images and improve the contrast, without considerable degree of success. The proposed technique in this paper tries to cope with the very low resolution and low contrast face images obtained from surveillance cameras, for FR under surveillance conditions. For Support Vector Machine classification, the selection of appropriate kernel has been a widely discussed issue in the research community. In this paper, we propose a novel kernel selection technique termed as MFKL (Multi-Feature Kernel Learning) to obtain the best feature-kernel pairing. Our proposed technique employs a effective kernel selection by Multiple Kernel Learning (MKL) method, to choose the optimal kernel to be used along with unsupervised domain adaptation method in the Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space (RKHS), for a solution to the problem. Rigorous experimentation has been performed on three real-world surveillance face datasets : FR\_SURV, SCface and ChokePoint. Results have been shown using Rank-1 Recognition Accuracy, ROC and CMC measures. Our proposed method outperforms all other recent state-of-the-art techniques by a considerable margin.

在过去的几十年里，人脸识别（FR）已经引起了许多研究人员的兴趣，因为它具有被动的生物认证特性。尽管在控制条件下通过人脸识别算法获得高准确度，但是在监视场景中获得的面部图像的性能相同是主要的障碍。为了超分辨低分辨率的人脸图像和提高对比度，已经做了一些尝试，没有取得相当大的成功。本文提出的技术试图应对来自监视摄像机的非常低分辨率和低对比度的面部图像，在监视条件下处理FR。对于支持向量机分类，适当内核的选择已经成为研究界广泛讨论的问题。在本文中，我们提出了一种称为MFKL（多特征核学习）的新型内核选择技术来获得最佳的特征 - 内核配对。我们提出的方法采用多核学习（MKL）方法进行有效核选择，在再生核希尔伯特空间（RKHS）中选择最优核与无监督域自适应方法，以解决问题。在三个真实世界的监测人脸数据集上进行了严格的实验：FR \ _SURV，SCface和ChokePoint。使用Rank-1识别准确度，ROC和CMC测量显示结果。我们提出的方法胜过所有其他最新的最先进的技术。
