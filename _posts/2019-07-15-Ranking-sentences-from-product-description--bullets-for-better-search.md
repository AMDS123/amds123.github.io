##### Abstract
Products in an ecommerce catalog contain information-rich fields like description and bullets that can be useful to extract entities (attributes) using NER based systems. However, these fields are often verbose and contain lot of information that is not relevant from a search perspective. Treating each sentence within these fields equally can lead to poor full text match and introduce problems in extracting attributes to develop ontologies, semantic search etc. To address this issue, we describe two methods based on extractive summarization with reinforcement learning by leveraging information in product titles and search click through logs to rank sentences from bullets, description, etc. Finally, we compare the accuracy of these two models.
