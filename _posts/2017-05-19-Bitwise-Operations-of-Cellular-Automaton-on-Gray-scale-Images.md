##### Abstract
Cellular Automata (CA) theory is a discrete model that represents the state of each of its cells from a finite set of possible values which evolve in time according to a pre-defined set of transition rules. CA have been applied to a number of image processing tasks such as Convex Hull Detection, Image Denoising etc. but mostly under the limitation of restricting the input to binary images. In general, a gray-scale image may be converted to a number of different binary images which are finally recombined after CA operations on each of them individually. We have developed a multinomial regression based weighed summation method to recombine binary images for better performance of CA based Image Processing algorithms. The recombination algorithm is tested for the specific case of denoising Salt and Pepper Noise to test against standard benchmark algorithms such as the Median Filter for various images and noise levels. The results indicate several interesting invariances in the application of the CA, such as the particular noise realization and the choice of sub-sampling of pixels to determine recombination weights. Additionally, it appears that simpler algorithms for weight optimization which seek local minima work as effectively as those that seek global minima such as Simulated Annealing.

元胞自动机（CA）理论是一种离散的模型，它根据预先定义的一组过渡规则，根据一组有限的可能值，根据预先定义的时间演变来表示它的每个单元的状态。 CA已经被应用于许多图像处理任务，如凸包检测，图像去噪等，但大多受到限制输入到二值图像的限制。通常，灰度图像可以被转换成许多不同的二进制图像，这些二进制图像在CA操作之后被单独地最终重新组合。我们开发了一种基于多项式回归的加权求和方法来重组二进制图像，以提高基于CA的图像处理算法的性能。重组算法针对去噪盐和胡椒噪声的特定情况进行测试，以针对标准基准算法（诸如用于各种图像和噪声水平的中值滤波器）进行测试。结果表明了CA在应用中的几个有趣的不变性，例如特定的噪声实现和像素的二次采样选择，以确定重组权重。另外，似乎寻求局部最小值工作的简单算法与寻求全局最小值（例如模拟退火）的算法一样有效。
