##### Abstract
We have demonstrated that GaN Schottky diodes can be used for high energy (64.8 MeV) proton detection. Such proton beams are used for tumor treatment, for which accurate and radiation resistant detectors are needed. Schottky diodes have been measured to be highly sensitive to protons, to have a linear response with beam intensity and fast enough for the application. Some photoconductive gain was found in the diode leading to a good compromise between responsivity and response time. The imaging capability of GaN diodes in proton detection is also demonstrated.
