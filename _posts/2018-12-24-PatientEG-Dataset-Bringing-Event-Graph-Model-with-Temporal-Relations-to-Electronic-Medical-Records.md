##### Abstract
Medical activities, such as diagnoses, medicine treatments, and laboratory tests, as well as temporal relations between these activities are the basic concepts in clinical research. However, existing relational data model on electronic medical records (EMRs) lacks explicit and accurate semantic definitions of these concepts. It leads to the inconvenience of query construction and the inefficiency of query execution where multi-table join queries are frequently required. In this paper, we propose a patient event graph (PatientEG) model to capture the characteristics of EMRs. We respectively define five types of medical entities, five types of medical events and five types of temporal relations. Based on the proposed model, we also construct a PatientEG dataset with 191,294 events, 3,429 distinct entities, and 545,993 temporal relations using EMRs from Shanghai Shuguang hospital. To help to normalize entity values which contain synonyms, hyponymies, and abbreviations, we link them with the Chinese biomedical knowledge graph. With the help of PatientEG dataset, we are able to conveniently perform complex queries for clinical research such as auxiliary diagnosis and therapeutic effectiveness analysis. In addition, we provide a SPARQL endpoint to access PatientEG dataset and the dataset is also publicly available online. Also, we list several illustrative SPARQL queries on our website.
