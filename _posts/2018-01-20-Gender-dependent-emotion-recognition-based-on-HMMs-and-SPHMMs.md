##### Abstract
It is well known that emotion recognition performance is not ideal. The work of this research is devoted to improving emotion recognition performance by employing a two-stage recognizer that combines and integrates gender recognizer and emotion recognizer into one system. Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) and Suprasegmental Hidden Markov Models (SPHMMs) have been used as classifiers in the two-stage recognizer. This recognizer has been tested on two distinct and separate emotional speech databases. The first database is our collected database and the second one is the Emotional Prosody Speech and Transcripts database. Six basic emotions including the neutral state have been used in each database. Our results show that emotion recognition performance based on the two-stage approach (gender-dependent emotion recognizer) has been significantly improved compared to that based on emotion recognizer without gender information and emotion recognizer with correct gender information by an average of 11% and 5%, respectively. This work shows that the highest emotion identification performance takes place when the classifiers are completely biased towards suprasegmental models and no impact of acoustic models. The results achieved based on the two-stage framework fall within 2.28% of those obtained in subjective assessment by human judges.

众所周知，情绪识别的表现并不理想。这项研究的工作是致力于提高情绪识别性能，采用两阶段识别器，结合性别识别器和情感识别器集成到一个系统。隐马尔可夫模型（HMM）和超切分隐马尔可夫模型（SPHMM）已被用作两阶段识别器中的分类器。这个识别器已经在两个截然不同的情感语音数据库上进行了测试。第一个数据库是我们收集的数据库，第二个数据库是情绪韵律语音和成绩单数据库。每个数据库都使用了六种基本情绪，包括中性状态。我们的研究结果表明，基于两阶段方法（基于性别的情绪识别器）的情绪识别性能比没有性别信息和情绪识别器的情绪识别器具有正确的性别信息的平均11％和5％ ％， 分别。这项工作表明，当分类器完全偏向超分割模型而没有声学模型的影响时，发生最高的情感识别性能。基于两阶段框架所取得的成果，与法官主观评估所获得的结果相差2.28％。
