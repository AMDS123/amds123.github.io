##### Abstract
The Classification of medical images and illustrations in the literature aims to label a medical image according to the modality it was produced or label an illustration according to its production attributes. It is an essential and challenging research hotspot in the area of automated literature review, retrieval and mining. The significant intra-class variation and inter-class similarity caused by the diverse imaging modalities and various illustration types brings a great deal of difficulties to the problem. In this paper, we propose a synergic deep learning (SDL) model to address this issue. Specifically, a dual deep convolutional neural network with a synergic signal system is designed to mutually learn image representation. The synergic signal is used to verify whether the input image pair belongs to the same category and to give the corrective feedback if a synergic error exists. Our SDL model can be trained 'end to end'. In the test phase, the class label of an input can be predicted by averaging the likelihood probabilities obtained by two convolutional neural network components. Experimental results on the ImageCLEF2016 Subfigure Classification Challenge suggest that our proposed SDL model achieves the state-of-the art performance in this medical image classification problem and its accuracy is higher than that of the first place solution on the Challenge leader board so far.

文献中的医学图像分类和插图旨在根据医学图像的形式来标注医学图像，或者根据图像的生产属性标注图像。这是自动化文献检索，检索和挖掘领域的一个重要和具有挑战性的研究热点。由于不同的成像方式和不同的插图类型造成的显着的班内变异和班级间的相似性给这个问题带来了很大的困难。在本文中，我们提出了一个协同深度学习（SDL）模型来解决这个问题。具体而言，设计了一个具有协同信号系统的双深度卷积神经网络来相互学习图像表示。协同信号用于验证输入图像对是否属于同一类别，如果存在协同误差则给出纠正反馈。我们的SDL模型可以进行“端到端”培训。在测试阶段，输入的类别标签可以通过平均两个卷积神经网络分量得到的似然概率来预测。 ImageCLEF2016子图分类挑战的实验结果表明，我们提出的SDL模型在这个医学图像分类问题上达到了最先进的性能，其准确性比迄今为止挑战排行榜上的第一位解决方案更高。
