##### Abstract
As a new machine learning approach, extreme learning machine (ELM) has received wide attentions due to its good performances. However, when directly applied to the hyperspectral image (HSI) classification, the recognition rate is too low. This is because ELM does not use the spatial information which is very important for HSI classification. In view of this, this paper proposes a new framework for spectral-spatial classification of HSI by combining ELM with loopy belief propagation (LBP). The original ELM is linear, and the nonlinear ELMs (or Kernel ELMs) are the improvement of linear ELM (LELM). However, based on lots of experiments and analysis, we found out that the LELM is a better choice than nonlinear ELM for spectral-spatial classification of HSI. Furthermore, we exploit the marginal probability distribution that uses the whole information in the HSI and learn such distribution using the LBP. The proposed method not only maintain the fast speed of ELM, but also greatly improves the accuracy of classification. The experimental results in the well-known HSI data sets, Indian Pines and Pavia University, demonstrate the good performances of the proposed method.

作为一种新的机器学习方法，极限学习机（ELM）由于其良好的性能而备受关注。然而，直接应用于高光谱图像（HSI）分类时，识别率太低。这是因为ELM不使用对于HSI分类非常重要的空间信息。鉴于此，本文提出了一种结合ELM和Loopy置信传播（LBP）的HSI光谱空间分类新框架。原始的ELM是线性的，而非线性ELM（或核ELM）是线性ELM（LELM）的改进。然而，经过大量的实验和分析，我们发现LELM是比非线性ELM更好的选择，用于HSI的光谱空间分类。此外，我们利用HSI中使用整个信息的边际概率分布，并使用LBP来学习这种分布。该方法不仅保持了ELM的快速性，而且大大提高了分类的准确性。众所周知的HSI数据集Indian Pines和Pavia University的实验结果证明了该方法的良好性能。
