##### Abstract
Residual learning has recently surfaced as an effective means of constructing very deep neural networks for object recognition. However, current incarnations of residual networks do not allow for the modeling and integration of complex relations between closely coupled recognition tasks or across domains. Such problems are often encountered in multimedia applications involving large-scale content recognition. We propose a novel extension of residual learning for deep networks that enables intuitive learning across multiple related tasks using cross-connections called cross-residuals. These cross-residuals connections can be viewed as a form of in-network regularization and enables greater network generalization. We show how cross-residual learning (CRL) can be integrated in multitask networks to jointly train and detect visual concepts across several tasks. We present a single multitask cross-residual network with >40% less parameters that is able to achieve competitive, or even better, detection performance on a visual sentiment concept detection problem normally requiring multiple specialized single-task networks. The resulting multitask cross-residual network also achieves better detection performance by about 10.4% over a standard multitask residual network without cross-residuals with even a small amount of cross-task weighting.

残留学习最近已经成为构建用于目标识别的非常深的神经网络的有效手段。然而，残留网络的当前化身不允许在紧密耦合的识别任务之间或跨领域建模和集成复杂关系。在涉及大规模内容识别的多媒体应用中经常遇到这样的问题。我们提出了一个深度网络的残留学习新颖的扩展，使跨交叉连接称为交叉残差直观学习跨多个相关的任务。这些交叉残差连接可以被看作是网络内正则化的一种形式，并且能够实现更大的网络泛化。我们展示了如何将交叉残差学习（CRL）集成到多任务网络中，以便在多个任务中共同训练和检测视觉概念。我们提出了一个多任务交叉残差网络，参数少40％以上，能够在通常需要多个专用单任务网络的视觉情感概念检测问题上实现有竞争力的甚至更好的检测性能。由此产生的多任务交叉残差网络在标准的多任务残差网络上也能获得比10.4％更好的检测性能，即使是少量的交叉任务加权也没有交叉残差。
