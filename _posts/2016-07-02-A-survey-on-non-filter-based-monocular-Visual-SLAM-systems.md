##### Abstract
Extensive research in the field of Visual SLAM for the past fifteen years has yielded workable systems that found their way into various applications, such as robotics and augmented reality. Although filter-based (e.g., Kalman Filter, Particle Filter) Visual SLAM systems were common at some time, non-filter based (i.e., akin to SfM solutions), which are more efficient, are becoming the de facto methodology for building a Visual SLAM system. This paper presents a survey that covers the various non-filter based Visual SLAM systems in the literature, detailing the various components of their implementation, while critically assessing the specific strategies made by each proposed system in implementing its components.

##### Abstract (translated by Google)
在过去15年的视觉SLAM领域的广泛研究已经产生了可行的系统，发现他们的方式进入各种应用程序，如机器人和增强现实。尽管基于滤波器（例如，卡尔曼滤波器，粒子滤波器）的视觉SLAM系统在某些时候是常见的，但是更有效的基于非滤波器（即类似于SfM解决方案）正成为构建视觉的事实上的方法SLAM系统。本文提出了一个调查，涵盖了文献中的各种非基于滤波器的视觉SLAM系统，详细描述了其实现的各个组成部分，同时对每个提出的系统在实现其组件时所采取的具体策略进行了批判性评估。
