##### Abstract
Over the past decade, many research articles have been published in the area of autonomous driving. However, most of them focus only on a specific technological area, such as visual environment perception, vehicle control, etc. Furthermore, due to fast advances in the self-driving car technology, such articles become obsolete very fast. In this paper, we give a brief but comprehensive overview on key ingredients of autonomous cars (ACs), including driving automation levels, AC sensors, AC software, open source datasets, industry leaders, AC applications and existing challenges.
