##### Abstract
We propose a method for constructing artificial intelligence (AI) of mahjong, which is a multiplayer imperfect information game. Since the size of the game tree is huge, constructing an expert-level AI player of mahjong is challenging. We define multiple Markov decision processes (MDPs) as abstractions of mahjong to construct effective search trees. We also introduce two methods of inferring state values of the original mahjong using these MDPs. We evaluated the effectiveness of our method using gameplays vis-\`{a}-vis the current strongest AI player.
