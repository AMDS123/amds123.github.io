##### Abstract
Question generation is a challenging task which aims to ask a question based on an answer and relevant context. The existing works suffer from the mismatching between question type and answer, i.e. generating a question with type $how$ while the answer is a personal name. We propose to automatically predict the question type based on the input answer and context. Then, the question type is fused into a seq2seq model to guide the question generation, so as to deal with the mismatching problem. We achieve significant improvement on the accuracy of question type prediction and finally obtain state-of-the-art results for question generation on both SQuAD and MARCO datasets.
