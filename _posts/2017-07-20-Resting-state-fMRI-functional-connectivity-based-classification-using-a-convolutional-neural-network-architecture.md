##### Abstract
Machine learning techniques have become increasingly popular in the field of resting state fMRI (functional magnetic resonance imaging) network based classification. However, the application of convolutional networks has been proposed only very recently and has remained largely unexplored. In this paper we describe a convolutional neural network architecture for functional connectome classification called connectome-convolutional neural network (CCNN). Our results on simulated datasets and a publicly available dataset for amnestic mild cognitive impairment classification demonstrate that our CCNN model can efficiently distinguish between subject groups. We also show that the connectome-convolutional network is capable to combine information from diverse functional connectivity metrics and that models using a combination of different connectivity descriptors are able to outperform classifiers using only one metric. From this flexibility follows that our proposed CCNN model can be easily adapted to a wide range of connectome based classification or regression tasks, by varying which connectivity descriptor combinations are used to train the network.

机器学习技术在静息状态fMRI（功能磁共振成像）网络分类领域已经变得越来越流行。然而，卷积网络的应用仅在最近才被提出，并且在很大程度上仍未被探索。在本文中，我们描述了称为连接组卷积神经网络（CCNN）的功能连接组分类的卷积神经网络结构。我们在模拟数据集和遗忘性轻度认知障碍分类的公开数据集上的结果表明，我们的CCNN模型可以有效地区分主体组。我们还表明connectome卷积网络能够结合来自不同功能连通度量度的信息，并且使用不同连接描述符的组合的模型能够仅使用一个量度而胜过分类器。根据这种灵活性，我们提出的CCNN模型可以很容易地适应各种基于connectome的分类或回归任务，通过改变连接描述符组合来训练网络。
