##### Abstract
Semi Natural Algorithmic composition (SNCA) is the technique of using algorithms to create music note sequences in computer with the understanding that how to render them would be decided by the composer. In our approach we are proposing an SNCA2 algorithm (extension of SNCA algorithm) with an illustrative example in Raga Bageshree. For this, Transition probability matrix (tpm) was created for the note sequences of Raga Bageshree, then first order Markov chain (using SNCA) and second order Markov chain (using SNCA2) simulations were performed for generating arbitrary sequences of notes of Raga Bageshree. The choice between first and second order Markov model, is best left to the composer who has to decide how to render these music notes sequences. We have confirmed that Markov chain of order of three and above are not promising, as the tpm of these become sparse matrices.

半自然算法组合（SNCA）是使用算法在计算机中创建音符音序的技术，其理解是如何渲染它们将由作曲家决定。在我们的方法中，我们提出了SNCA2算法（SNCA算法的扩展）以及Raga Bageshree中的说明性示例。为此，为Raga Bageshree的音符序列创建转移概率矩阵（tpm），然后执行一阶马尔可夫链（使用SNCA）和二阶马尔可夫链（使用SNCA2）模拟以生成Raga Bageshree的任意音符序列。在一阶和二阶马尔可夫模型之间的选择最好由作曲家决定如何渲染这些音符序列。我们已经证实，三阶及以上的马尔可夫链并不乐观，因为这些链的tpm变为稀疏矩阵。
