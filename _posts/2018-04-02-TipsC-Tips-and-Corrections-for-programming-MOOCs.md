##### Abstract
With the widespread adoption of MOOCs in academic institutions, it has become imperative to come up with better techniques to solve the tutoring and grading problems posed by programming courses. Programming being the new 'writing', it becomes a challenge to ensure that a large section of the society is exposed to programming. Due to the gradient in learning abilities of students, the course instructor must ensure that everyone can cope up with the material, and receive adequate help in completing assignments while learning along the way. We introduce TipsC for this task. By analyzing a large number of correct submissions, TipsC can search for correct codes resembling a given incorrect solution. Without revealing the actual code, TipsC then suggests changes in the incorrect code to help the student fix logical runtime errors. In addition, this also serves as a cluster visualization tool for the instructor, revealing different patterns in user submissions. We evaluated the effectiveness of TipsC's clustering algorithm on data collected from previous offerings of an introductory programming course conducted at IIT Kanpur where the grades were given by human TAs. The results show the weighted average variance of marks for clusters when similar submissions are grouped together is 47% less compared to the case when all programs are grouped together.

随着MOOC在学术机构中的广泛采用，提出更好的技术来解决编程课程引起的辅导和评分问题已成为当务之急。编程是新的“写作”，确保大部分社会都接触编程成为一项挑战。由于学生学习能力的梯度，课程导师必须确保每个人都能够应付材料，并在完成任务时获得足够的帮助来完成作业。我们为此任务介绍TipsC。通过分析大量正确的提交内容，TipsC可以搜索类似于给定不正确解决方案的正确代码。在不透露实际代码的情况下，TipsC会建议修改不正确的代码以帮助学生修复逻辑运行时错误。此外，这也可以作为教师的群集可视化工具，揭示用户提交的不同模式。我们评估了TipsC的聚类算法对从先前在IIT坎普尔进行的介绍性编程课程中提供的数据收集到的数据的有效性，该课程由人类TA进行评分。结果显示，类似提交被分组在一起时，集群的标记的加权平均方差比所有程序被分组在一起时减少了47％。
