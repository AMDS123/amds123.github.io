##### Abstract
The goal of the Internet of Things (IoT) is to transform any thing around us, such as a trash can or a street light, into a smart thing. A smart thing has the ability of sensing, processing, communicating and/or actuating. In order to achieve the goal of a smart IoT application, such as minimizing waste transportation costs or reducing energy consumption, the smart things in the application scenario must cooperate with each other without a centralized control. Inspired by known approaches to design swarm of cooperative and autonomous robots, we modeled our smart things based on the embodied cognition concept. Each smart thing is a physical agent with a body composed of a microcontroller, sensors and actuators, and a brain that is represented by an artificial neural network. This type of agent is commonly called an embodied agent. The behavior of these embodied agents is autonomously configured through an evolutionary algorithm that is triggered according to the application performance. To illustrate, we have designed three homogeneous prototypes for smart street lights based on an evolved network. This application has shown that the proposed approach results in a feasible way of modeling decentralized smart things with self-developed and cooperative capabilities.

物联网（IoT）的目标是将我们周围的任何东西（如垃圾桶或路灯）转变为明智之物。一个聪明的东西有感应，处理，沟通和/或致动的能力。为了实现智能物联网应用的目标，如最大限度减少垃圾运输成本或降低能源消耗，应用场景中的智能物件必须相互配合，而无需集中控制。受到已知的合作式和自主式机器人群设计方法的启发，我们基于体现的认知概念对我们的智能事物进行建模。每一个聪明的东西都是一个身体代理人，身体由一个微控制器，传感器和执行器，以及一个由人工神经网络代表的大脑。这种类型的代理通常被称为具体代理。这些嵌入式代理的行为是通过根据应用程序性能触发的演化算法自主配置的。为了说明，我们设计了三个基于演化网络的智能路灯同质原型。这个应用程序已经表明，所提出的方法产生了一个可行的方式来建模具有自我开发和合作能力的分散智能事物。
