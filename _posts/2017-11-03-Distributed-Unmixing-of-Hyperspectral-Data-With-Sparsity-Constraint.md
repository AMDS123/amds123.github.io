##### Abstract
Spectral unmixing (SU) is a data processing problem in hyperspectral remote sensing. The significant challenge in the SU problem is how to identify endmembers and their weights, accurately. For estimation of signature and fractional abundance matrices in a blind problem, nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) and its developments are used widely in the SU problem. One of the constraints which was added to NMF is sparsity constraint that was regularized by L 1/2 norm. In this paper, a new algorithm based on distributed optimization has been used for spectral unmixing. In the proposed algorithm, a network including single-node clusters has been employed. Each pixel in hyperspectral images considered as a node in this network. The distributed unmixing with sparsity constraint has been optimized with diffusion LMS strategy, and then the update equations for fractional abundance and signature matrices are obtained. Simulation results based on defined performance metrics, illustrate advantage of the proposed algorithm in spectral unmixing of hyperspectral data compared with other methods. The results show that the AAD and SAD of the proposed approach are improved respectively about 6 and 27 percent toward distributed unmixing in SNR=25dB.

光谱分解（SU）是高光谱遥感中的一个数据处理问题。 SU问题面临的重大挑战是如何准确地识别成员及其权重。对于盲问题中的签名和分数丰度矩阵的估计，非负矩阵分解（NMF）及其发展在SU问题中被广泛使用。 NMF中加入的约束之一是稀疏性约束，由L 1/2范数规则化。在本文中，一种基于分布式优化的新算法已经被用于光谱解混。在所提出的算法中，采用了包括单节点集群的网络。高光谱图像中的每个像素都被视为该网络中的一个节点。利用扩散LMS策略对稀疏约束下的分布式混合进行了优化，得到了分数丰度和签名矩阵的更新方程。基于定义的性能指标的仿真结果说明了与其他方法相比，该算法在高光谱数据光谱分解中的优势。结果表明，所提出的方法的AAD和SAD分别在信噪比= 25dB时分别提高了6％和27％。
