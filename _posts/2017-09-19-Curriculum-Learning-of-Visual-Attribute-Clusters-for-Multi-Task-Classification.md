##### Abstract
Visual attributes, from simple objects (e.g., backpacks, hats) to soft-biometrics (e.g., gender, height, clothing) have proven to be a powerful representational approach for many applications such as image description and human identification. In this paper, we introduce a novel method to combine the advantages of both multi-task and curriculum learning in a visual attribute classification framework. Individual tasks are grouped after performing hierarchical clustering based on their correlation. The clusters of tasks are learned in a curriculum learning setup by transferring knowledge between clusters. The learning process within each cluster is performed in a multi-task classification setup. By leveraging the acquired knowledge, we speed-up the process and improve performance. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method via ablation studies and a detailed analysis of the covariates, on a variety of publicly available datasets of humans standing with their full-body visible. Extensive experimentation has proven that the proposed approach boosts the performance by 4% to 10%.

从简单的物体（例如背包，帽子）到软生物特征（例如性别，身高，衣服）的视觉属性已被证明是许多应用（例如图像描述和人类识别）的强有力的代表性方法。在本文中，我们引入了一种将多任务和课程学习的优点结合在一个视觉属性分类框架中的新方法。个别任务根据其相关性进行分层聚类后分组。在课程学习设置中通过在集群之间传递知识来学习任务集群。每个集群内的学习过程是在多任务分类设置中执行的。通过利用所获得的知识，我们加快了过程并提高了绩效。我们通过消融研究和协变量的详细分析，证明了我们的方法的有效性，在各种公开可用的人类站立与他们的全身可见的数据集。大量的实验已经证明，所提出的方法提高了4％到10％的性能。
