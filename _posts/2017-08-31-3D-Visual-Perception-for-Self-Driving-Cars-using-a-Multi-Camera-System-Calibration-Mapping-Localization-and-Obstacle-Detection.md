##### Abstract
Cameras are a crucial exteroceptive sensor for self-driving cars as they are low-cost and small, provide appearance information about the environment, and work in various weather conditions. They can be used for multiple purposes such as visual navigation and obstacle detection. We can use a surround multi-camera system to cover the full 360-degree field-of-view around the car. In this way, we avoid blind spots which can otherwise lead to accidents. To minimize the number of cameras needed for surround perception, we utilize fisheye cameras. Consequently, standard vision pipelines for 3D mapping, visual localization, obstacle detection, etc. need to be adapted to take full advantage of the availability of multiple cameras rather than treat each camera individually. In addition, processing of fisheye images has to be supported. In this paper, we describe the camera calibration and subsequent processing pipeline for multi-fisheye-camera systems developed as part of the V-Charge project. This project seeks to enable automated valet parking for self-driving cars. Our pipeline is able to precisely calibrate multi-camera systems, build sparse 3D maps for visual navigation, visually localize the car with respect to these maps, generate accurate dense maps, as well as detect obstacles based on real-time depth map extraction.

由于摄像头是低成本，小型的，提供有关环境的外观信息以及在各种天气条件下工作，因此摄像头对于自动驾驶汽车来说是至关重要的外接传感器。他们可以用于多种目的，如视觉导航和障碍物检测。我们可以使用环绕多摄像头系统来覆盖汽车周围的全方位360度视野。这样，我们避免了可能导致事故的盲点。为了最大限度地减少环绕感知所需的相机数量，我们利用鱼眼相机。因此，3D映射，视觉定位，障碍物检测等的标准视觉管线需要适应于充分利用多个照相机的可用性，而不是单独处理每个照相机。另外，鱼眼图像的处理必须得到支持。在本文中，我们将介绍作为V-Charge项目一部分开发的多鱼眼相机系统的相机校准和后续处理流程。这个项目旨在为自动驾驶汽车启用自动代客泊车。我们的工作流程能够精确校准多相机系统，为视觉导航建立稀疏的3D地图，根据这些地图对汽车进行视觉定位，生成准确的密集地图，以及基于实时深度图提取来检测障碍物。
