##### Abstract
Text articles with false claims, especially news, have recently become aggravating for the Internet users. These articles are in wide circulation and readers face difficulty discerning fact from fiction. Previous work on credibility assessment has focused on factual analysis and linguistic features. The task's main challenge is the distinction between the features of true and false articles. In this paper, we propose a novel approach called Credibility Outcome (CREDO) which aims at scoring the credibility of an article in an open domain setting. CREDO consists of different modules for capturing various features responsible for the credibility of an article. These features includes credibility of the article's source and author, semantic similarity between the article and related credible articles retrieved from a knowledge base, and sentiments conveyed by the article. A neural network architecture learns the contribution of each of these modules to the overall credibility of an article. Experiments on Snopes dataset reveals that CREDO outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches based on linguistic features.

##### Abstract (translated by Google)
有虚假声明的文本文章，特别是新闻，最近对于互联网用户而言变得更加严重。这些文章广泛流传，读者面临困难，难以辨别事实。以前关于可信度评估的工作主要集中在事实分析和语言特征上。该任务的主要挑战是真假文章的特征之间的区别。在本文中，我们提出了一种称为可信度结果（CREDO）的新方法，旨在评估开放域设置中文章的可信度。 CREDO由不同模块组成，用于捕捉负责文章可信度的各种功能。这些功能包括文章来源和作者的可信度，文章与从知识库中检索的相关可信文章之间的语义相似度，以及文章传达的情感。神经网络体系结构学习了这些模块中每一个对文章总体可信度的贡献。 Snopes数据集上的实验表明，CREDO优于基于语言特征的最先进方法。
