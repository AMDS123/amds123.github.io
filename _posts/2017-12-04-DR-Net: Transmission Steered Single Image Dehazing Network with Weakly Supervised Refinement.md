##### Abstract
Despite the recent progress in image dehazing, several problems remain largely unsolved such as robustness for varying scenes, the visual quality of reconstructed images, and effectiveness and flexibility for applications. To tackle these problems, we propose a new deep network architecture for single image dehazing called DR-Net. Our model consists of three main subnetworks: a transmission prediction network that predicts transmission map for the input image, a haze removal network that reconstructs latent image steered by the transmission map, and a refinement network that enhances the details and color properties of the dehazed result via weakly supervised learning. Compared to previous methods, our method advances in three aspects: (i) pure data-driven model; (ii) the end-to-end system; (iii) superior robustness, accuracy, and applicability. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our DR-Net outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on both synthetic and real images in qualitative and quantitative metrics. Additionally, the utility of DR-Net has been illustrated by its potential usage in several important computer vision tasks.

尽管最近在图像除雾方面取得了进展，但仍然有很多问题没有得到解决，如各种场景的鲁棒性，重建图像的视觉质量以及应用的有效性和灵活性。为了解决这些问题，我们提出了一种称为DR-Net的单一图像去雾的新型深度网络结构。我们的模型由三个主要子网络组成：预测输入图像的透射图的透射预测网络，重构由透射图引导的潜像的雾霾消除网络以及增强去雾化结果的细节和颜色特性的细化网络通过弱监督学习。与以前的方法相比，我们的方法有三个方面的进步：（1）纯粹的数据驱动模型; （ii）端对端系统; （iii）优越的稳健性，准确性和适用性。大量实验表明，我们的DR-Net在定性和定量指标上优于综合和真实图像的最新方法。此外，DR-Net的实用性已经在几个重要的计算机视觉任务中用于其潜在用途。
