##### Abstract
Computational ghost imaging (CGI) is a single-pixel imaging technique that exploits the correlation between known random patterns and the measured intensity of light transmitted (or reflected) by an object. Although CGI can obtain two- or three- dimensional images with a single or a few bucket detectors, the quality of the reconstructed images is reduced by noise due to the reconstruction of images from random patterns. In this study, we improve the quality of CGI images using deep learning. A deep neural network is used to automatically learn the features of noise-contaminated CGI images. After training, the network is able to predict low-noise images from new noise-contaminated CGI images.

计算重影成像（CGI）是一种单像素成像技术，利用已知随机图案与被测物体透射（或反射）的光强度之间的相关性。尽管CGI可以用单个或几个桶形探测器获得二维或三维图像，但重建图像的质量由于随机图像重建而降低了噪声。在这项研究中，我们使用深度学习来提高CGI图像的质量。使用深度神经网络自动学习噪声污染的CGI图像的特征。在训练之后，网络能够从新的噪声污染的CGI图像预测低噪声图像。
