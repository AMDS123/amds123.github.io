##### Abstract
Ground penetrating radar (GPR) is one of the most popular and successful sensing modalities that has been investigated for landmine and subsurface threat detection. Many of the detection algorithms applied to this task are supervised and therefore require labeled examples of target and non-target data for training. Training data most often consists of 2-dimensional images (or patches) of GPR data, from which features are extracted, and provided to the classifier during training and testing. Identifying desirable training and testing locations to extract patches, which we term "keypoints", is well established in the literature. In contrast however, a large variety of strategies have been proposed regarding keypoint utilization (e.g., how many of the identified keypoints should be used at targets, or non-target, locations). Given the variety keypoint utilization strategies that are available, it is very unclear (i) which strategies are best, or (ii) whether the choice of strategy has a large impact on classifier performance. We address these questions by presenting a taxonomy of existing utilization strategies, and then evaluating their effectiveness on a large dataset using many different classifiers and features. We analyze the results and propose a new strategy, called PatchSelect, which outperforms other strategies across all experiments.

探地雷达（GPR）是地雷和地下威胁检测中最受欢迎和成功的传感方式之一。许多应用于这个任务的检测算法是监督的，因此需要标记的目标和非目标数据的例子进行训练。训练数据通常由GPR数据的二维图像（或补丁）组成，从中提取特征，并在训练和测试期间提供给分类器。确定理想的培训和测试位置来提取补丁，这是我们所说的“关键点”，在文献中已经确立。然而，相比之下，已经提出了关于关键点利用的多种策略（例如，在目标或非目标地点应该使用多少个所识别的关键点）。考虑到可用的各种关键点利用策略，（i）哪种策略是最好的，或者（ii）策略的选择是否对分类器性能有很大影响是非常不明确的。我们通过提出现有利用策略的分类来解决这些问题，然后使用许多不同的分类器和特征来评估它们在大数据集上的有效性。我们分析结果并提出一个名为PatchSelect的新策略，它在所有实验中都优于其他策略。
