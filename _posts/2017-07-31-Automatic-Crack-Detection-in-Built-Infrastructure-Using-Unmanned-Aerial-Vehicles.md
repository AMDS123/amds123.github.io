##### Abstract
This paper addresses the problem of crack detection which is essential for health monitoring of built infrastructure. Our approach includes two stages, data collection using unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and crack detection using histogram analysis. For the data collection, a 3D model of the structure is first created by using laser scanners. Based on the model, geometric properties are extracted to generate way points necessary for navigating the UAV to take images of the structure. Then, our next step is to stick together those obtained images from the overlapped field of view. The resulting image is then clustered by histogram analysis and peak detection. Potential cracks are finally identified by using locally adaptive thresholds. The whole process is automatically carried out so that the inspection time is significantly improved while safety hazards can be minimised. A prototypical system has been developed for evaluation and experimental results are included.

本文针对建筑基础设施健康监测所必需的裂缝检测问题。我们的方法包括两个阶段，使用无人机的数据收集和使用直方图分析的裂缝检测。对于数据收集，首先使用激光扫描仪创建结构的3D模型。基于该模型，提取几何特性以生成导航UAV以拍摄结构图像所必需的路点。那么，我们下一步就是将这些获得的图像从重叠的视野中粘在一起。然后通过直方图分析和峰值检测将得到的图像聚类。最终通过使用局部自适应阈值来识别潜在的裂缝。整个过程自动执行，大大提高了检测时间，同时最大限度地减少了安全隐患。已经开发了用于评估的原型系统，并且包括实验结果。
