##### Abstract
In this paper, a time delay neural network (TDNN) based acoustic model is proposed to implement a fast-converged acoustic modeling for Korean speech recognition. The TDNN has an advantage in fast-convergence where the amount of training data is limited, due to subsampling which excludes duplicated weights. The TDNN showed an absolute improvement of 2.12% in terms of character error rate compared to feed forward neural network (FFNN) based modelling for Korean speech corpora. The proposed model converged 1.67 times faster than a FFNN-based model did.

本文提出了一种基于时延神经网络（TDNN）的声学模型，实现了韩语语音识别的快速收敛声学建模。由于不包括重复权重的子采样，TDNN在快速收敛方面具有优势，其中训练数据的数量是有限的。与基于前馈神经网络（FFNN）的韩语语音语料库建模相比，TDNN在字符错误率方面表现出绝对改善2.12％。所提出的模型比基于FFNN的模型快1.67倍。
