##### Abstract
Chinese poetry generation is a very challenging task in natural language processing. In this paper, we propose a novel two-stage poetry generating method which first plans the sub-topics of the poem according to the user's writing intent, and then generates each line of the poem sequentially, using a modified recurrent neural network encoder-decoder framework. The proposed planning-based method can ensure that the generated poem is coherent and semantically consistent with the user's intent. A comprehensive evaluation with human judgments demonstrates that our proposed approach outperforms the state-of-the-art poetry generating methods and the poem quality is somehow comparable to human poets.

中国诗歌一代在自然语言处理中是一个非常具有挑战性的任务。在本文中，我们提出了一种新颖的两阶段诗歌创作方法，首先根据用户的书写意图计划诗歌的子题目，然后依次生成诗歌的每一行，使用修改的递归神经网络编码器 - 解码器框架。所提出的基于规划的方法可以确保生成的诗与用户的意图一致且语义一致。综合评价人的判断表明，我们提出的方法胜过了最先进的诗歌创作方法，诗歌的质量与人类诗人有某种可比性。
