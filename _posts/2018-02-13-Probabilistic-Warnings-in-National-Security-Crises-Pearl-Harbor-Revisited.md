##### Abstract
Imagine a situation where a group of adversaries is preparing an attack on the United States or U.S. interests. An intelligence analyst has observed some signals, but the situation is rapidly changing. The analyst faces the decision to alert a principal decision maker that an attack is imminent, or to wait until more is known about the situation. This warning decision is based on the analyst's observation and evaluation of signals, independent or correlated, and on her updating of the prior probabilities of possible scenarios and their outcomes. The warning decision also depends on the analyst's assessment of the crisis' dynamics and perception of the preferences of the principal decision maker, as well as the lead time needed for an appropriate response. This article presents a model to support this analyst's dynamic warning decision. As with most problems involving warning, the key is to manage the tradeoffs between false positives and false negatives given the probabilities and the consequences of intelligence failures of both types. The model is illustrated by revisiting the case of the attack on Pearl Harbor in December 1941. It shows that the radio silence of the Japanese fleet carried considerable information (Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's "dog in the night" problem), which was misinterpreted at the time. Even though the probabilities of different attacks were relatively low, their consequences were such that the Bayesian dynamic reasoning described here may have provided valuable information to key decision makers.

##### Abstract (translated by Google)
想象一下，一群敌手正准备袭击美国或美国的利益。情报分析师已经观察到一些信号，但情况正在迅速变化。分析师面临决定提醒主要决策者即将发生攻击，或等待更多人了解情况。该警告决定基于分析师对独立或相关信号的观察和评估，以及她更新可能情景及其结果的先验概率。警告决定还取决于分析师对危机动态和对主要决策者偏好的看法的评估，以及适当反应所需的准备时间。本文提供了一个模型来支持此分析师的动态警告决策。与大多数涉及警告的问题一样，关键在于假设两种类型的智能失败的概率和后果，管理假阳性和假阴性之间的权衡。这个模型通过重新审视1941年12月袭击珍珠港的案例来说明。它表明，日本舰队的无线电沉默带有相当多的信息（阿瑟·柯南道尔爵士的“晚上的狗”问题），这被误解为时间。即使不同攻击的概率相对较低，其后果也是如此，这里描述的贝叶斯动态推理可能为关键决策者提供了有价值的信息。
