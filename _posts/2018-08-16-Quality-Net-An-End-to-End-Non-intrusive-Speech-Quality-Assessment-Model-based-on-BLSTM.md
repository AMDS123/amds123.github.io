##### Abstract
Nowadays, most of the objective speech quality assessment tools (e.g., perceptual evaluation of speech quality (PESQ)) are based on the comparison of the degraded/processed speech with its clean counterpart. The need of a "golden" reference considerably restricts the practicality of such assessment tools in real-world scenarios since the clean reference usually cannot be accessed. On the other hand, human beings can readily evaluate the speech quality without any reference (e.g., mean opinion score (MOS) tests), implying the existence of an objective and non-intrusive (no clean reference needed) quality assessment mechanism. In this study, we propose a novel end-to-end, non-intrusive speech quality evaluation model, termed Quality-Net, based on bidirectional long short-term memory. The evaluation of utterance-level quality in Quality-Net is based on the frame-level assessment. Frame constraints and sensible initializations of forget gate biases are applied to learn meaningful frame-level quality assessment from the utterance-level quality label. Experimental results show that Quality-Net can yield high correlation to PESQ (0.9 for the noisy speech and 0.84 for the speech processed by speech enhancement). We believe that Quality-Net has potential to be used in a wide variety of applications of speech signal processing.

如今，大多数客观语音质量评估工具（例如，语音质量的感知评估（PESQ））基于降级/处理的语音与其清洁对应物的比较。由于通常无法访问干净的参考，因此对“黄金”参考的需求极大地限制了这种评估工具在实际场景中的实用性。另一方面，人类可以在没有任何参考（例如，平均意见得分（MOS）测试）的情况下容易地评估语音质量，这意味着存在客观的和非侵入性的（不需要干净的参考）质量评估机制。在这项研究中，我们提出了一种新颖的端到端，非侵入式语音质量评估模型，称为Quality-Net，基于双向长期短期记忆。质量网中话语级质量的评估基于帧级评估。应用帧约束和遗忘门偏差的合理初始化来从话语级质量标签中学习有意义的帧级质量评估。实验结果表明，Quality-Net可以产生与PESQ的高度相关性（噪声语音为0.9，语音增强语音为0.84）。我们相信Quality-Net有可能用于语音信号处理的各种应用。
