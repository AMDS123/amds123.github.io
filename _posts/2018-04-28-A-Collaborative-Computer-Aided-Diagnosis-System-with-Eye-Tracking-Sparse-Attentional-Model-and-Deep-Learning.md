##### Abstract
There are at least two categories of errors in radiology screening that can lead to suboptimal diagnostic decisions and interventions:(i)human fallibility and (ii)complexity of visual search. Computer aided diagnostic (CAD) tools are developed to help radiologists to compensate for some of these errors. However, despite their significant improvements over conventional screening strategies, most CAD systems do not go beyond their use as second opinion tools due to producing a high number of false positives, which human interpreters need to correct. In parallel with efforts in computerized analysis of radiology scans, several researchers have examined behaviors of radiologists while screening medical images to better understand how and why they miss tumors, how they interact with the information in an image, and how they search for unknown pathology in the images. Eye-tracking tools have been instrumental in exploring answers to these fundamental questions. In this paper, we aim to develop a paradigm shift CAD system, called collaborative CAD (C-CAD), that unifies both of the above mentioned research lines: CAD and eye-tracking. We design an eye-tracking interface providing radiologists with a real radiology reading room experience. Then, we propose a novel algorithm that unifies eye-tracking data and a CAD system. Specifically, we present a new graph based clustering and sparsification algorithm to transform eye-tracking data (gaze) into a signal model to interpret gaze patterns quantitatively and qualitatively. The proposed C-CAD collaborates with radiologists via eye-tracking technology and helps them to improve diagnostic decisions. The C-CAD learns radiologists' search efficiency by processing their gaze patterns. To do this, the C-CAD uses a deep learning algorithm in a newly designed multi-task learning platform to segment and diagnose cancers simultaneously.
