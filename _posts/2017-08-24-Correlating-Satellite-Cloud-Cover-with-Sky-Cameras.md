##### Abstract
The role of clouds is manifold in understanding the various events in the atmosphere, and also in studying the radiative balance of the earth. The conventional manner of such cloud analysis is performed mainly via satellite images. However, because of its low temporal- and spatial- resolutions, ground-based sky cameras are now getting popular. In this paper, we study the relation between the cloud cover obtained from MODIS images, with the coverage obtained from ground-based sky cameras. This will help us to better understand cloud formation in the atmosphere - both from satellite images and ground-based observations.

云的作用在于理解大气中的各种事件，以及研究地球的辐射平衡方面是多方面的。主要通过卫星图像来执行这种云分析的传统方式。然而，由于其时间和空间分辨率较低，地面天空相机现在正在流行。在本文中，我们研究了从MODIS图像获得的云量与从地面天空相机获得的覆盖度之间的关系。这将有助于我们更好地理解大气中云的形成 - 无论是卫星图像还是地面观测。
