##### Abstract
Cassava is the third largest source of carbohydrates for human food in the world but is vulnerable to virus diseases, which threaten to destabilize food security in sub-Saharan Africa. Novel methods of cassava disease detection are needed to support improved control which will prevent this crisis. Image recognition offers both a cost effective and scalable technology for disease detection. New transfer learning methods offer an avenue for this technology to be easily deployed on mobile devices. Using a dataset of cassava disease images taken in the field in Tanzania, we applied transfer learning to train a deep convolutional neural network to identify three diseases and two types of pest damage (or lack thereof). The best trained model accuracies were 98% for brown leaf spot (BLS), 96% for red mite damage (RMD), 95% for green mite damage (GMD), 98% for cassava brown streak disease (CBSD), and 96% for cassava mosaic disease (CMD). The best model achieved an overall accuracy of 93% for data not used in the training process. Our results show that the transfer learning approach for image recognition of field images offers a fast, affordable, and easily deployable strategy for digital plant disease detection.

木薯是世界上第三大人类食物碳水化合物的来源，但易受到病毒病的威胁，这可能会破坏撒哈拉以南非洲地区的粮食安全。需要新的木薯病检测方法来支持改进的控制措施，以防止这种危机。图像识别为疾病检测提供了成本有效且可扩展的技术。新的传输学习方法为这项技术提供了一个易于在移动设备上部署的途径。利用坦桑尼亚野外采集的木薯病图像数据集，应用转移学习训练深层卷积神经网络，以识别三种病害和两种类型的病虫害（或缺乏）。棕色斑点（BLS）的最佳训练模型精度为98％，红螨损伤（RMD）为96％，绿螨损伤（GMD）为95％，木薯褐斑病（CBSD）为98％，96％木薯花叶病（CMD）。对于培训过程中未使用的数据，最佳模型的总体准确率为93％。我们的研究结果表明，转换学习方法的图像识别领域的图像提供了一个快速，价格合理，易于部署的数字植物病害检测策略。
