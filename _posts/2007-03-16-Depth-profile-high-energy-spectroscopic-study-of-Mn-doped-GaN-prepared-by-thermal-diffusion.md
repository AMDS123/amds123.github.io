##### Abstract
We have performed an $in$-$situ$ depth profile study of Mn-doped GaN prepared by a low temperature thermal diffusion method using photoemission and x-ray absorption spectroscopy. It was revealed from the core-level photoemission measurements that Mn ions are diffused into a deep ($\sim$ 70 \AA) region of the GaN substrates and that the line shapes of Mn 3$d$ partial density of states obtained by resonant photoemission measurements was close to that of Ga$_{1-x}$Mn$_x$N thin films grown by molecular-beam epitaxy. From x-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) and x-ray magnetic circular dichroism (XMCD) measurements at the Mn $L$-edge, it was revealed that the doped Mn ions were in the divalent Mn$^{2+}$ state and primarily paramagnetic. In magnetization measurements, weak hysteresis was detected in samples prepared using $p$-type GaN substrates while samples using $n$-type GaN substrates showed only paramagnetism.
