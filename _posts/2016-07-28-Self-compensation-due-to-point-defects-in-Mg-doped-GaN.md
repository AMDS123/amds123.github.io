##### Abstract
Using hybrid density functional theory, we address point defects susceptible to cause charge compensation upon Mg doping of GaN. We determine the free energy of formation of the nitrogen vacancy and of several Mg-related defects. The entropic contribution as a function of temperature is determined within the quasiharmonic approximation. We find that the Mg interstitial shows a noticeably lower free energy of formation than the Mg substitutional to Ga in p-type conditions. Therefore, the Mg impurity is amphoteric behaving like an acceptor when substitutional to Ga and like a double donor when accommodated in an interstitial position. The hybrid-functional results are then linked to experimental observations by solving the charge neutrality equations for semiconductor dominated by impurities. We show that a thermodynamic equilibrium model is unable to account for the experimental hole concentration as a function of Mg doping density, due to nitrogen vacancies and Mg interstitials acting as compensating donors. To explain the experimental result, which includes a dropoff of the hole concentration at high Mg densities, we thus resort to nonequilibrium models. We show that either nitrogen vacancies or Mg interstitials could be at the origin of the self-compensation mechanism. However, only the model based on interstitial Mg donors provides a natural mechanism to account for the sudden appearance of self-compensation. Indeed, the amphoteric nature of the Mg impurity leads to Fermi-level pinning and accounts for the observed dropoff of the hole concentration of GaN samples at high Mg doping. Our work suggests that current limitations in p-type doping of GaN could be overcome by extrinsically controlling the Fermi energy during growth.

使用混合密度泛函理论，我们提出了在GaN的Mg掺杂时容易引起电荷补偿的点缺陷。我们确定形成氮空位的自由能和几个与镁有关的缺陷。作为温度函数的熵贡献是在准谐波近似内确定的。我们发现在p型条件下，Mg间隙显示出比Mg替代Ga显着更低的形成自由能。因此，当Mg置换成Ga时，Mg杂质是两性表现为受体的，并且当被置于间隙位置时，如同双施主。然后通过求解以杂质为主的半导体的电荷中性方程，将杂化功能结果与实验观察结果联系起来。我们表明，热力学平衡模型不能说明作为Mg掺杂密度函数的实验空穴浓度，这是由于氮空位和Mg间隙作为补偿供体。为了解释实验结果，包括在高Mg浓度下的空穴浓度的下降，我们因此求助于非平衡模型。我们表明，氮空位或镁插页式可能是自我补偿机制的起源。然而，只有基于镁间质捐赠者的模型提供了自然机制来解释自我报酬的突然出现。事实上，Mg杂质的两性性质导致费米能级钉扎，并且说明在高Mg掺杂下GaN样品的空穴浓度的观察到的下降。我们的工作表明，目前GaN的p型掺杂的限制可以通过外生的控制生长过程中的费米能量来克服。
