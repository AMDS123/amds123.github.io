##### Abstract
Image segmentation is still an open problem especially when intensities of the interested objects are overlapped due to the presence of intensity inhomogeneity (also known as bias field). To segment images with intensity inhomogeneities, a bias correction embedded level set model is proposed where Inhomogeneities are Estimated by Orthogonal Primary Functions (IEOPF). In the proposed model, the smoothly varying bias is estimated by a linear combination of a given set of orthogonal primary functions. An inhomogeneous intensity clustering energy is then defined and membership functions of the clusters described by the level set function are introduced to define a data term energy of the proposed model. Similar to popular level set methods, a regularization term and an arc length term are also included to regularize and smooth the level set function, respectively. The proposed model are then extended to multichannel and multiphase pattern to segment colourful images and images with multiple objects. It has been extensively tested on both synthetic and real images that are widely used in the literature and public BrainWeb and IBSR datasets. Experimental results and comparison with state-of-the-art methods demonstrate that advantages of the proposed model in terms of bias correction and segmentation accuracy.

图像分割仍然是一个开放的问题，尤其是当感兴趣的对象的强度由于存在强度不均匀性（也称为偏置场）而重叠时。为了对强度不均匀的图像进行分割，提出了一种基于正交初级函数（IEOPF）估计非均匀性的偏置校正嵌入水平集模型。在所提出的模型中，通过给定的一组正交主函数的线性组合来估计平滑变化的偏差。然后定义非均匀强度聚类能量，并引入由水平集函数描述的聚类的隶属函数来定义所提出的模型的数据项能量。与常用的水平集方法类似，正则化项和弧长项也被分别用于规则化和平滑水平集函数。所提出的模型然后扩展到多通道和多相模式，以分割彩色图像和多个对象的图像。已经在文献和公众BrainWeb和IBSR数据集中广泛使用的合成和真实图像进行了广泛测试。实验结果和与最先进方法的比较表明，所提出的模型在偏差校正和分段准确性方面的优点。
