##### Abstract
In the mammalian brain newly acquired memories depend on the hippocampus for maintenance and recall, but over time these functions are taken over by the neocortex through a process called systems consolidation. However, reactivation of a consolidated memory can induce a brief period of temporary hippocampus-dependence, followed by return to hippocampus-independence. Here we present a computational model that uses simulation of recently described mechanisms of synaptic plasticity to account for findings from the systems consolidation/reconsolidation literature and to make predictions for future research.
