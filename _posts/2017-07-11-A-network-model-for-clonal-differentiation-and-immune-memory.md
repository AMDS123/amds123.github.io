##### Abstract
A model of bit-strings, that uses the technique of multi-spin coding, was previously used to study the time evolution of B-cell clone repertoire, in a paper by Lagreca, Almeida and Santos. In this work we extend that simplified model to include independently the role of the populations of antibodies, in the control of the immune response, producing mechanisms of differentiation and regulation in a more complete way. Although the antibodies have the same molecular shape of the B-cells receptors (BCR), they should present a different time evolution and thus should be treated separately. We have also studied a possible model for the network immune memory, suggesting a random memory regeneration, which is self-perpetuating.
