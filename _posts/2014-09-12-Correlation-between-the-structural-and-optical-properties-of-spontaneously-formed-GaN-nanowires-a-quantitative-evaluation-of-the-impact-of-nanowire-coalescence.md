##### Abstract
We investigate the structural and optical properties of spontaneously formed GaN nanowires with different degrees of coalescence. This quantity is determined by an analysis of the cross-sectional area and perimeter of the nanowires obtained by plan-view scanning electron microscopy. X-ray diffraction experiments are used to measure the inhomogeneous strain in the nanowire ensembles as well as the orientational distribution of the nanowires. The comparison of the results obtained for GaN nanowire ensembles prepared on bare Si(111) and AlN buffered 6H-SiC(000-1) reveals that the main source of the inhomogeneous strain is the random distortions caused by the coalescence of adjacent nanowires. The magnitude of the strain inhomogeneity induced by nanowire coalescence is found not to be determined solely by the coalescence degree, but also by the mutual misorientation of the coalesced nanowires. The linewidth of the donor-bound exciton transition in photoluminescence spectra does not exhibit a monotonic increase with the coalescence degree. In contrast, the comparison of the root mean square strain with the linewidth of the donor-bound exciton transition reveals a clear correlation: the higher the strain inhomogeneity, the larger the linewidth.

##### Abstract (translated by Google)
我们研究了不同聚结度的自发形成的GaN纳米线的结构和光学性质。该量通过对平面扫描电子显微镜获得的纳米线的横截面积和周长的分析来确定。用X射线衍射实验测量纳米线集合体中的不均匀应变以及纳米线的取向分布。对在裸Si（111）和AlN缓冲6H-SiC（000-1）上制备的GaN纳米线集合所获得的结果的比较揭示，非均匀应变的主要来源是由相邻纳米线的合并引起的随机失真。发现由纳米线聚结引起的应变不均匀性的大小不仅仅由聚结程度决定，而且还由聚结纳米线的相互定向取向决定。光致发光谱中施主束缚激子跃迁的谱线宽度并不随聚结度的增加而呈单调增加。相比之下，均方根应变与施主束缚激子跃迁线宽的比较显示出明显的相关性：应变不均匀性越高，线宽越大。
