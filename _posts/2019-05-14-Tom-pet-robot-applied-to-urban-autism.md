##### Abstract
With the fast development of network information technology, more and more people are immersed in the virtual community environment brought by the network, ignoring the social interaction in real life. The consequent urban autism problem has become more and more serious. Promoting offline communication between people " and "eliminating loneliness through emotional communication between pet robots and breeders" to solve this problem, and has developed a design called "Tom". "Tom" is a smart pet robot with a pet robot-based social mechanism Called "Tom-Talker". The main contribution of this paper is to propose a social mechanism called "Tom-Talker" that encourages users to socialize offline. And "Tom-Talker" also has a corresponding reward mechanism and a friend recommendation algorithm. It also proposes a pet robot named "Tom" with an emotional interaction algorithm to recognize users' emotions, simulate animal emotions and communicate emotionally with use s. This paper designs experiments and analyzes the results. The results show that our pet robots have a good effect on solving urban autism problems.
