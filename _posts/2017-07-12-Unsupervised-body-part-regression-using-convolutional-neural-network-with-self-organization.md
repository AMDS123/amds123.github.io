##### Abstract
Automatic body part recognition for CT slices can benefit various medical image applications. Existing methods require large-scale datasets of labeled images. However, the intrinsic structure information in CT volumes was still not fully leveraged. In this paper, we propose unsupervised body part regressor (UBR) to utilize this information. A novel learning framework based on a convolutional neural network and two inter-sample loss functions was designed. UBR builds a coordinate system for the body and outputs a continuous score for each slice, which represents the normalized position of the body part in the slice. The training process of UBR resembles a self-organization process: slice scores are learned from inter-slice relationships. The training samples are unlabeled volumes that are abundant in every hospital's database, thus zero annotation effort is needed. UBR is simple, fast, and accurate. Qualitative and quantitative experiments proved its effectiveness. Besides, we show potential applications of UBR in network initialization and anomaly detection.

CT切片的自动身体部位识别可以使各种医学图像应用受益。现有方法需要标记图像的大规模数据集。然而，CT卷的内在结构信息仍未充分利用。在本文中，我们提出无监督的身体部分回归（UBR）来利用这些信息。设计了一种基于卷积神经网络和两个样本间损失函数的新型学习框架。 UBR为身体建立一个坐标系，并为每个切片输出一个连续的分数，这个分数代表切片中身体部位的标准化位置。 UBR的训练过程类似于一个自组织过程：从片间关系中学习切片分数。训练样本是没有标签的卷，在每个医院的数据库中都很丰富，因此需要零注释。 UBR简单，快速，准确。定性和定量实验证明了它的有效性。此外，我们还展示了UBR在网络初始化和异常检测中的潜在应用。
