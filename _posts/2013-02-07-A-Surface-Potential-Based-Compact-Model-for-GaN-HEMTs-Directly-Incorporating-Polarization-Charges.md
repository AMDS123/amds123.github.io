##### Abstract
A method to incorporate polarization charges at heterojunctions in compact models for transistors is presented. By including the polarization sheet charge as a Dirac delta function, the Poisson equation is solved to yield a closed equation for the surface potential. A compact model for transistors based on the surface potential incorporating polarization charges describes the on-state as well as the off-state regimes of device operation. The new method of incorporating polarization charges in compact models helps make a direct connection to the material properties of the transistor. The current-voltage (I-V) curves generated by this model are in good agreement with the experimental data for GaN HEMTs.

介绍了在晶体管的紧凑模型中在异质结中引入极化电荷的方法。通过将偏振片电荷包括为狄拉克δ函数，求解泊松方程以产生表面电势的闭合方程。基于包含极化电荷的表面电势的晶体管的紧凑型模型描述了器件操作的导通状态以及断态状态。将极化电荷并入紧凑型器件的新方法有助于直接连接晶体管的材料属性。由该模型产生的电流 - 电压（I-V）曲线与GaN HEMT的实验数据非常吻合。
