##### Abstract
In this work, we present an application of domain randomization and generative adversarial networks (GAN) to train a near real-time object detector for industrial electric parts, entirely in a simulated environment. Large scale availability of labelled real world data is typically rare and difficult to obtain in many industrial settings. As such here, only a few hundred of unlabelled real images are used to train a Cyclic-GAN network, in combination with various degree of domain randomization procedures. We demonstrate that this enables robust translation of synthetic images to the real world domain. We show that a combination of the original synthetic (simulation) and GAN translated images, when used for training a Mask-RCNN object detection network achieves greater than 0.95 mean average precision in detecting and classifying a collection of industrial electric parts. We evaluate the performance across different combinations of training data.
