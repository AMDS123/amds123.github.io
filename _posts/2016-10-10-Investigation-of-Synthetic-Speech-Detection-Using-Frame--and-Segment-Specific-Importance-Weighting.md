##### Abstract
Speaker verification systems are vulnerable to spoofing attacks which presents a major problem in their real-life deployment. To date, most of the proposed synthetic speech detectors (SSDs) have weighted the importance of different segments of speech equally. However, different attack methods have different strengths and weaknesses and the traces that they leave may be short or long term acoustic artifacts. Moreover, those may occur for only particular phonemes or sounds. Here, we propose three algorithms that weigh likelihood-ratio scores of individual frames, phonemes, and sound-classes depending on their importance for the SSD. Significant improvement over the baseline system has been obtained for known attack methods that were used in training the SSDs. However, improvement with unknown attack types was not substantial. Thus, the type of distortions that were caused by the unknown systems were different and could not be captured better with the proposed SSD compared to the baseline SSD.

说话人验证系统很容易受到欺骗攻击，这在现实生活中是一个主要问题。迄今为止，大多数提出的合成语音检测器（SSD）已经同样地加权了不同语段的重要性。然而，不同的攻击手段有不同的优缺点，它们留下的痕迹可能是短期或长期的声学伪影。而且，这些可能只发生在特定的音素或声音上。在这里，我们提出了三种算法，根据它们对于SSD的重要性来权衡单个帧，音素和声音类别的似然比分数。已经获得了用于训练SSD的已知攻击方法的基准系统的显着改进。但是，未知攻击类型的改善并不大。因此，由未知系统引起的失真类型是不同的，并且与基线SSD相比，所提出的SSD不能被更好地捕获。
