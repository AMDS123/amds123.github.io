##### Abstract
Query Understanding concerns about inferring the precise intent of search by the user with his formulated query, which is challenging because the queries are often very short and ambiguous. The report discusses the various kind of queries that can be put to a Search Engine and illustrates the Role of Query Understanding for return of relevant results. With different advances in techniques for deep understanding of queries as well as documents, the Search Technology has witnessed three major era. A lot of interesting real world examples have been used to illustrate the role of Query Understanding in each of them. The Query Understanding Module is responsible to correct the mistakes done by user in the query, to guide him in formulation of query with precise intent, and to precisely infer the intent of the user query. The report describes the complete architecture to handle aforementioned three tasks, and then discusses basic as well as recent advanced techniques for each of the component, through appropriate papers from reputed conferences and journals.
