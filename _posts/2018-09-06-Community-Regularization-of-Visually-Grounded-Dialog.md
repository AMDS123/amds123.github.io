##### Abstract
The task of conducting visually grounded dialog involves learning goal-oriented cooperative dialog between autonomous agents who exchange information about a scene through several rounds of questions and answers in natural language. We posit that requiring artificial agents to adhere to the rules of human language, while also requiring them to maximize information exchange through dialog is an ill-posed problem. We observe that humans do not stray from a common language because they are social creatures who live in communities, and have to communicate with many people everyday, so it is far easier to stick to a common language even at the cost of some efficiency loss. Using this as inspiration, we propose and evaluate a multi-agent community-based dialog framework where each agent interacts with, and learns from, multiple agents, and show that this community-enforced regularization results in more relevant and coherent dialog (as judged by human evaluators) without sacrificing task performance (as judged by quantitative metrics).

进行视觉上基础对话的任务包括学习通过几轮问题和自然语言答案交换场景信息的自主代理之间的目标导向的合作对话。我们认为，要求人工代理人遵守人类语言规则，同时还要求他们通过对话最大限度地交换信息是一个不适定的问题。我们观察到人类不会偏离共同语言，因为他们是生活在社区中的社交生物，并且必须每天与许多人交流，因此即使以某种效率损失为代价，也更容易坚持使用共同语言。以此为灵感，我们提出并评估了多代理社区为基础的对话框架，每个代理与互动，并从多个代理获悉，以及表明该社区实行正规化的结果更具相关性和连贯的对话框（如判断人类评估员）在不牺牲任务绩效的情况下（通过量化指标判断）。
