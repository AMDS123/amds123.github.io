##### Abstract
Pedestrian detection is a popular research topic due to its paramount importance for a number of applications, especially in the fields of automotive, surveillance and robotics. Despite the significant improvements, pedestrian detection is still an open challenge that calls for more and more accurate algorithms. In the last few years, deep learning and in particular convolutional neural networks emerged as the state of the art in terms of accuracy for a number of computer vision tasks such as image classification, object detection and segmentation, often outperforming the previous gold standards by a large margin. In this paper, we propose a pedestrian detection system based on deep learning, adapting a general-purpose convolutional network to the task at hand. By thoroughly analyzing and optimizing each step of the detection pipeline we propose an architecture that outperforms traditional methods, achieving a task accuracy close to that of state-of-the-art approaches, while requiring a low computational time. Finally, we tested the system on an NVIDIA Jetson TK1, a 192-core platform that is envisioned to be a forerunner computational brain of future self-driving cars.

行人检测是一个非常受欢迎的研究课题，因为它对于一些应用尤其是在汽车，监控和机器人领域尤为重要。尽管有显着的改进，行人检测仍然是一个开放的挑战，需要更多更精确的算法。在过去的几年中，深度学习，特别是卷积神经网络在许多计算机视觉任务如图像分类，目标检测和分割的准确性方面表现为现有技术水平，通常比以前的黄金标准更胜一筹大幅度上涨。在本文中，我们提出了一个基于深度学习的行人检测系统，使通用卷积网络适应手头的任务。通过彻底分析和优化检测流水线的每一步，我们提出了一种超越传统方法的体系结构，实现了接近于最先进方法的任务精度，同时需要较少的计算时间。最后，我们使用NVIDIA Jetson TK1（一款192核心平台）来测试该系统，该平台被设想为未来自动驾驶汽车的先驱计算大脑。
