##### Abstract
Factors determining the carrier distribution in InGaN/GaN multiple-quantum-well (MQW) light-emitting diodes (LEDs) are studied via photoluminescence and temperature-dependent electroluminescence spectra. Employing a dichromatic LED device, we demonstrate that the carrier recombination rate should be considered playing an important role in determining the carrier distribution in the MQW active region, not just the simple hole characteristics such as low mobility and large effective mass.
