##### Abstract
Deep learning approaches have reached a celebrity status in artificial intelligence field, its success have mostly relied on Convolutional Networks (CNN) and Recurrent Networks. By exploiting fundamental spatial properties of images and videos, the CNN always achieves dominant performance on visual tasks. And the Recurrent Networks (RNN) especially long short-term memory methods (LSTM) can successfully characterize the temporal correlation, thus exhibits superior capability for time series tasks. Traffic flow data have plentiful characteristics on both time and space domain. However, applications of CNN and LSTM approaches on traffic flow are limited. In this paper, we propose a novel deep architecture combined CNN and LSTM to forecast future traffic flow (CLTFP). An 1-dimension CNN is exploited to capture spatial features of traffic flow, and two LSTMs are utilized to mine the short-term variability and periodicities of traffic flow. Given those meaningful features, the feature-level fusion is performed to achieve short-term forecasting. The proposed CLTFP is compared with other popular forecasting methods on an open datasets. Experimental results indicate that the CLTFP has considerable advantages in traffic flow forecasting. in additional, the proposed CLTFP is analyzed from the view of Granger Causality, and several interesting properties of CLTFP are discovered and discussed .

深度学习方法在人工智能领域已经达到了名人地位，其成功主要依赖于卷积网络（CNN）和递归网络。通过利用图像和视频的基本空间属性，CNN总是在视觉任务上实现主导性能。而递归网络（RNN）尤其是长时间短时记忆方法（LSTM）能够成功地表征时间相关性，从而表现出时间序列任务的优越性。交通流量数据在时间和空间上都具有丰富的特征。但是，CNN和LSTM方法在交通流量中的应用是有限的。本文提出了一种结合CNN和LSTM的新型深层架构来预测未来的交通流量（CLTFP）。利用一维CNN捕捉交通流的空间特征，利用两个LSTM挖掘交通流的短期变化性和周期性。鉴于这些有意义的特征，要进行特征级融合以实现短期预测。建议的CLTFP与其他流行的预测方法在开放数据集上进行比较。实验结果表明，CLTFP在交通流量预测中具有相当的优势。此外，从Granger因果关系的角度分析了CLTFP的提出，并且发现和讨论了CLTFP的一些有趣的特性。
