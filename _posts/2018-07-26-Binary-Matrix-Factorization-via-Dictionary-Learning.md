##### Abstract
Matrix factorization is a key tool in data analysis; its applications include recommender systems, correlation analysis, signal processing, among others. Binary matrices are a particular case which has received significant attention for over thirty years, especially within the field of data mining. Dictionary learning refers to a family of methods for learning overcomplete basis (also called frames) in order to efficiently encode samples of a given type; this area, now also about twenty years old, was mostly developed within the signal processing field. In this work we propose two binary matrix factorization methods based on a binary adaptation of the dictionary learning paradigm to binary matrices. The proposed algorithms focus on speed and scalability; they work with binary factors combined with bit-wise operations and a few auxiliary integer ones. Furthermore, the methods are readily applicable to online binary matrix factorization. Another important issue in matrix factorization is the choice of rank for the factors; we address this model selection problem with an efficient method based on the Minimum Description Length principle. Our preliminary results show that the proposed methods are effective at producing interpretable factorizations of various data types of different nature.

矩阵分解是数据分析的关键工具;其应用包括推荐系统，相关分析，信号处理等。二元矩阵是一个特殊的案例，三十多年来一直受到重视，特别是在数据挖掘领域。字典学习是指用于学习超完备基础（也称为帧）的一系列方法，以便有效地编码给定类型的样本;这个区域现在也已有二十年历史，主要是在信号处理领域内开发的。在这项工作中，我们提出了两种二进制矩阵分解方法，它基于字典学习范例到二进制矩阵的二进制自适应。提出的算法侧重于速度和可扩展性;它们使用二进制因子结合逐位运算和一些辅助整数运算。此外，该方法可以容易地应用于在线二进制矩阵分解。矩阵分解中的另一个重要问题是选择因子的等级;我们用基于最小描述长度原理的有效方法解决了这个模型选择问题。我们的初步结果表明，所提出的方法可以有效地产生不同性质的各种数据类型的可解释的因子分解。
