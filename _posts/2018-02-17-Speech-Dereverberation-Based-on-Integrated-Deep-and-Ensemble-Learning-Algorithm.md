##### Abstract
Reverberation, which is generally caused by sound reflections from walls, ceilings, and floors, can result in severe performance degradation of acoustic applications. Due to a complicated combination of attenuation and time-delay effects, the reverberation property is difficult to characterize, and it remains a challenging task to effectively retrieve the anechoic speech signals from reverberation ones. In the present study, we proposed a novel integrated deep and ensemble learning algorithm (IDEA) for speech dereverberation. The IDEA consists of offline and online phases. In the offline phase, we train multiple dereverberation models, each aiming to precisely dereverb speech signals in a particular acoustic environment; then a unified fusion function is estimated that aims to integrate the information of multiple dereverberation models. In the online phase, an input utterance is first processed by each of the dereverberation models. The outputs of all models are integrated accordingly to generate the final anechoic signal. We evaluated the IDEA on designed acoustic environments, including both matched and mismatched conditions of the training and testing data. Experimental results confirm that the proposed IDEA outperforms single deep-neural-network-based dereverberation model with the same model architecture and training data.

通常由来自墙壁，天花板和地板的声音反射引起的混响会导致声学应用严重的性能下降。由于衰减和时延效应的复杂组合，混响特性难以表征，并且从混响效果中有效地检索无回声语音信号仍然是一项具有挑战性的任务。在本研究中，我们提出了一种用于语音去混响的新型集成深度集成学习算法（IDEA）。 IDEA由离线和在线阶段组成。在离线阶段，我们训练多个去混响模型，每个模型都旨在准确地在特定的声学环境中对混响声音进行去混响;然后估计一个统一的融合函数，旨在整合多个去混响模型的信息。在在线阶段，输入话语首先由每个去混响模型处理。所有型号的输出都相应集成以产生最终的消声信号。我们根据设计的声学环境评估了IDEA，包括培训和测试数据的匹配和不匹配条件。实验结果证实，所提出的IDEA优于具有相同模型结构和训练数据的单个基于深度神经网络的去混响模型。
