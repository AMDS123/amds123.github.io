##### Abstract
Current approaches have made great progress on image-to-image translation tasks benefiting from the success of image synthesis methods especially generative adversarial networks (GANs). However, existing methods are limited to handling translation tasks between two species while keeping the content matching on the semantic level. A more challenging task would be the translation among more than two species. To explore this new area, we propose a simple yet effective structure of a multi-branch discriminator for enhancing an arbitrary generative adversarial architecture (GAN), named GAN-MBD. It takes advantage of the boosting strategy to break a common discriminator into several smaller ones with fewer parameters, which can enhance the generation and synthesis abilities of GANs efficiently and effectively. Comprehensive experiments show that the proposed multi-branch discriminator can dramatically improve the performance of popular GANs on cross-species image-to-image translation tasks while reducing the number of parameters for computation. The code and some datasets are attached as supplementary materials for reference.
