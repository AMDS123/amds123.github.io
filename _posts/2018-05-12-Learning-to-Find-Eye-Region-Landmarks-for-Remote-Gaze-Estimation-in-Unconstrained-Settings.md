##### Abstract
Conventional feature-based and model-based gaze estimation methods have proven to perform well in settings with controlled illumination and specialized cameras. In unconstrained real-world settings, however, such methods are surpassed by recent appearance-based methods due to difficulties in modeling factors such as illumination changes and other visual artifacts. We present a novel learning-based method for eye region landmark localization that enables conventional methods to be competitive to latest appearance-based methods. Despite having been trained exclusively on synthetic data, our method exceeds the state of the art for iris localization and eye shape registration on real-world imagery. We then use the detected landmarks as input to iterative model-fitting and lightweight learning-based gaze estimation methods. Our approach outperforms existing model-fitting and appearance-based methods in the context of person-independent and personalized gaze estimation.

传统的基于特征和基于模型的注视估计方法已被证明在受控照明和专用相机的设置中表现良好。然而，在不受限制的真实世界环境中，由于模型因素（如光照变化和其他视觉伪影）的困难，这些方法被最近基于外观的方法所超越。我们提出了一种基于学习的眼部区域标志定位方法，使传统方法能够与最新的基于外观的方法相竞争。尽管我们的训练专门用于合成数据，但我们的方法超出了现实世界影像中虹膜定位和眼睛形状配准的现状。然后，我们将检测到的地标用作迭代模型拟合和基于轻量级学习的注视估计方法的输入。我们的方法在人独立和个性化凝视估计的情况下优于现有的模型拟合和基于外观的方法。
