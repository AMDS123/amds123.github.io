##### Abstract
Collaborative filtering (CF) aims to build a model from users' past behaviors and/or similar decisions made by other users, and use the model to recommend items for users. Despite of the success of previous collaborative filtering approaches, they are all based on the assumption that there are sufficient rating scores available for building high-quality recommendation models. In real world applications, however, it is often difficult to collect sufficient rating scores, especially when new items are introduced into the system, which makes the recommendation task challenging. We find that there are often "short" texts describing features of items, based on which we can approximate the similarity of items and make recommendation together with rating scores. In this paper we "borrow" the idea of vector representation of words to capture the information of short texts and embed it into a matrix factorization framework. We empirically show that our approach is effective by comparing it with state-of-the-art approaches.

##### Abstract (translated by Google)
协同过滤（CF）旨在从用户的过去行为和/或由其他用户做出的类似决策建立一个模型，并使用该模型向用户推荐项目。尽管以前的协作过滤方法取得了成功，但它们都是基于这样一个假设，即有足够的评分可用于构建高质量的推荐模型。然而，在现实世界的应用中，收集足够的评分往往是困难的，特别是当新项目被引入到系统中时，这使得推荐任务具有挑战性。我们发现，通常存在描述项目特征的“短”文本，通过这些“短”文本我们可以近似地估计项目的相似度，并与评分一起进行推荐。在本文中，我们借用词语向量表示的思想来捕捉短文本信息，并将其嵌入到矩阵分解框架中。我们凭经验证明，通过与最先进的方法进行比较，我们的方法是有效的。
