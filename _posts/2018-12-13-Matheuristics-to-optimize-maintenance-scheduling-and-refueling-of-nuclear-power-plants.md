##### Abstract
Scheduling the maintenances of nuclear power plants is a complex optimization problem, formulated in 2-stage stochastic programming for the EURO/ROADEF 2010 challenge. The first level optimizes the maintenance dates and refueling decisions. The second level optimizes the production to fulfill the power demands and to ensure feasibility and costs of the first stage decisions. This paper solves a deterministic version of the problem, studying Mixed Integer Programming (MIP) formulations and matheuristics. Relaxing only two sets of constraints of the ROADEF challenge, a MIP formulation can be written using only binary variables for the maintenance dates. The MIP formulations are used to design constructive matheuristics and a Variable Neighborhood Descent (VND) local search. These matheuristics produce very high quality solutions. Some intermediate results explains results of the Challenge: the relaxation of constraints CT6 are justified and neighborhood analyses with MIP-VND justifies the choice of neighborhoods to implement for the problem. Lastly, an extension with stability costs for monthly reoptimization is considered, with efficient bi-objective matheuristics.
