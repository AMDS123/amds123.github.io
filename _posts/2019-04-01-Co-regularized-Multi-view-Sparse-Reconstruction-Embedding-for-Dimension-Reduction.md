##### Abstract
With the development of information technology, we have witnessed an age of data explosion which produces a large variety of data filled with redundant information. Because dimension reduction is an essential tool which embeds high-dimensional data into a lower-dimensional subspace to avoid redundant information, it has attracted interests from researchers all over the world. However, facing with features from multiple views, it's difficult for most dimension reduction methods to fully comprehended multi-view features and integrate compatible and complementary information from these features to construct low-dimensional subspace directly. Furthermore, most multi-view dimension reduction methods cannot handle features from nonlinear spaces with high dimensions. Therefore, how to construct a multi-view dimension reduction methods which can deal with multi-view features from high-dimensional nonlinear space is of vital importance but challenging. In order to address this problem, we proposed a novel method named Co-regularized Multi-view Sparse Reconstruction Embedding (CMSRE) in this paper. By exploiting correlations of sparse reconstruction from multiple views, CMSRE is able to learn local sparse structures of nonlinear manifolds from multiple views and constructs significative low-dimensional representations for them. Due to the proposed co-regularized scheme, correlations of sparse reconstructions from multiple views are preserved by CMSRE as much as possible. Furthermore, sparse representation produces more meaningful correlations between features from each single view, which helps CMSRE to gain better performances. Various evaluations based on the applications of document classification, face recognition and image retrieval can demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach on multi-view dimension reduction.
