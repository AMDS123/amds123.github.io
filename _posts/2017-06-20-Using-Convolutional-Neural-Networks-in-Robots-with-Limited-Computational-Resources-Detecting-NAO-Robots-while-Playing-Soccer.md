##### Abstract
The main goal of this paper is to analyze the general problem of using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) in robots with limited computational capabilities, and to propose general design guidelines for their use. In addition, two different CNN based NAO robot detectors that are able to run in real-time while playing soccer are proposed. One of the detectors is based on the XNOR-Net and the other on the SqueezeNet. Each detector is able to process a robot object-proposal in ~1ms, with an average number of 1.5 proposals per frame obtained by the upper camera of the NAO. The obtained detection rate is ~97%.

本文的主要目的是分析在计算能力有限的机器人中使用卷积神经网络（CNN）的一般性问题，并提出一般的设计指南。另外，还提出了两种不同的基于CNN的NAO机器人探测器，它们能够在踢足球的同时实时运行。其中一个检测器基于XNOR-Net，另一个在SqueezeNet上。每个探测器能够在1ms内处理一个机器人对象提议，NAO的上部摄像机获得平均每帧1.5个提议。获得的检测率为〜97％。
