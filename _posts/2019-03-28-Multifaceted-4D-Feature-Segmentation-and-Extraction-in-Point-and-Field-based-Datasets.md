##### Abstract
The use of large-scale multifaceted data is common in a wide variety of scientific applications. In many cases, this multifaceted data takes the form of a field-based (Eulerian) and point/trajectory-based (Lagrangian) representation as each has a unique set of advantages in characterizing a system of study. Furthermore, studying the increasing scale and complexity of these multifaceted datasets is limited by perceptual ability and available computational resources, necessitating sophisticated data reduction and feature extraction techniques. In this work, we present a new 4D feature segmentation/extraction scheme that can operate on both the field and point/trajectory data types simultaneously. The resulting features are time-varying data subsets that have both a field and point-based component, and were extracted based on underlying patterns from both data types. This enables researchers to better explore both the spatial and temporal interplay between the two data representations and study underlying phenomena from new perspectives. We parallelize our approach using GPU acceleration and apply it to real world multifaceted datasets to illustrate the types of features that can be extracted and explored.
