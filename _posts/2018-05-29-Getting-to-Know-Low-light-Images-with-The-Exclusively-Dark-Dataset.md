##### Abstract
Low-light is an inescapable element of our daily surroundings that greatly affects the efficiency of our vision. Research works on low-light has seen a steady growth, particularly in the field of image enhancement, but there is still a lack of a go-to database as benchmark. Besides, research fields that may assist us in low-light environments, such as object detection, has glossed over this aspect even though breakthroughs-after-breakthroughs had been achieved in recent years, most noticeably from the lack of low-light data (less than 2% of the total images) in successful public benchmark dataset such as PASCAL VOC, ImageNet, and Microsoft COCO. Thus, we propose the Exclusively Dark dataset to elevate this data drought, consisting exclusively of ten different types of low-light images (i.e. low, ambient, object, single, weak, strong, screen, window, shadow and twilight) captured in visible light only with image and object level annotations. Moreover, we share insightful findings in regards to the effects of low-light on the object detection task by analyzing visualizations of both hand-crafted and learned features. Most importantly, we found that the effects of low-light reaches far deeper into the features than can be solved by simple "illumination invariance'". It is our hope that this analysis and the Exclusively Dark dataset can encourage the growth in low-light domain researches on different fields. The Exclusively Dark dataset with its annotation is available at https://github.com/cs-chan/Exclusively-Dark-Image-Dataset

低光照是我们日常环境中不可避免的元素，极大地影响了我们视野的效率。有关低光照的研究工作稳步增长，特别是在图像增强领域，但仍缺乏一个以数据库为基准的数据库。此外，尽管近年来取得了突破性的突破，但最明显的原因是缺少低光数据，但在光线不足的环境下（如物体检测）的研究领域已经掩盖了这方面的问题超过总图像的2％）成功的公共基准数据集，如PASCAL VOC，ImageNet和Microsoft COCO。因此，我们建议使用Exclusively Dark数据集来提升这种数据干旱，其中包括由可见光捕获的十种不同类型的低光图像（即低光，环境，物体，单光，弱光，强光，屏幕，窗口，阴影和暮光）仅与图像和对象级别注释一起点亮。此外，我们通过分析手工制作和学习功能的可视化，分享关于低光照对物体检测任务影响的见解。最重要的是，我们发现低光照的影响远远超过了通过简单的“照明不变性”可以解决的问题。我们希望这一分析和Exclusively Dark数据集可以鼓励不同领域的低光域研究的增长。具有其注释的Exclusively Dark数据集可在https://github.com/cs-chan/Exclusively-Dark-Image-Dataset
