##### Abstract
We present a commonsense, qualitative model for the semantic grounding of embodied visuo-spatial and locomotive interactions. The key contribution is an integrative methodology combining low-level visual processing with high-level, human-centred representations of space and motion rooted in artificial intelligence. We demonstrate practical applicability with examples involving object interactions, and indoor movement.

##### Abstract (translated by Google)
我们提出一个常识，定性模型的语义基​​础的体现的视觉空间和机车互动。关键的贡献是将低级视觉处理与以人为本的高层次，以人为本的空间和运动表征相结合的综合方法。我们展示了涉及对象交互和室内运动的实际应用性。
