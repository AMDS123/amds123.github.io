##### Abstract
Modeling U.S. Congressional legislation and roll-call votes has received significant attention in previous literature. However, while legislators across 50 state governments and D.C. propose over 100,000 bills each year, and on average enact over 30% of them, state level analysis has received relatively less attention due in part to the difficulty in obtaining the necessary data. Since each state legislature is guided by their own procedures, politics and issues, however, it is difficult to qualitatively asses the factors that affect the likelihood of a legislative initiative succeeding. Herein, we present several methods for modeling the likelihood of a bill receiving floor action across all 50 states and D.C. We utilize the lexical content of over 1 million bills, along with contextual legislature and legislator derived features to build our predictive models, allowing a comparison of the factors that are important to the lawmaking process. Furthermore, we show that these signals hold complementary predictive power, together achieving an average improvement in accuracy of 18% over state specific baselines.

美国国会立法和唱名选票的建模在以前的文献中引起了极大的关注。然而，尽管50个州政府和国会的立法者每年提交超过10万份法案，并且平均颁布了30％以上的法案，但由于难以获得必要的数据，州级分析受到的关注较少。但是，由于每个州立法机构都是以他们自己的程序，政治和问题为指导的，因此很难从质量上评估影响立法倡议成功可能性的因素。在这里，我们提出了几种方法来模拟所有50个州和DC的账单接受场地动作的可能性。我们利用超过100万账单的词汇内容，以及上下文立法和立法者派生特征来构建我们的预测模型，从而进行比较对立法过程来说重要的因素。此外，我们显示这些信号具有互补的预测能力，共同实现了比状态特定基线平均提高18％的准确度。
