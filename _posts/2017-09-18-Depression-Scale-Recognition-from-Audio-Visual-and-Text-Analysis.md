##### Abstract
Depression is a major mental health disorder that is rapidly affecting lives worldwide. Depression not only impacts emotional but also physical and psychological state of the person. Its symptoms include lack of interest in daily activities, feeling low, anxiety, frustration, loss of weight and even feeling of self-hatred. This report describes work done by us for Audio Visual Emotion Challenge (AVEC) 2017 during our second year BTech summer internship. With the increase in demand to detect depression automatically with the help of machine learning algorithms, we present our multimodal feature extraction and decision level fusion approach for the same. Features are extracted by processing on the provided Distress Analysis Interview Corpus-Wizard of Oz (DAIC-WOZ) database. Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) clustering and Fisher vector approach were applied on the visual data; statistical descriptors on gaze, pose; low level audio features and head pose and text features were also extracted. Classification is done on fused as well as independent features using Support Vector Machine (SVM) and neural networks. The results obtained were able to cross the provided baseline on validation data set by 17% on audio features and 24.5% on video features.

抑郁症是一种严重的精神疾病，正在迅速影响全球的生活。抑郁症不仅影响情绪，还影响人的身体和心理状态。其症状包括对日常活动缺乏兴趣，感到低落，焦虑，挫折，体重减轻甚至自我仇恨的感觉。本报告介绍了我们在第二年BTech暑期实习期间为音视觉情绪挑战赛（AVEC）2017所做的工作。随着机器学习算法帮助自动检测抑郁症的需求增加，我们提出了同样的多模态特征提取和决策级融合方法。通过在提供的OZ（DAIC-WOZ）数据库中提供的遇险分析访谈语料库中提取特征。将高斯混合模型（GMM）聚类和Fisher矢量方法应用于视觉数据;统计描述符注视，姿势;低水平的音频特征和头部姿势和文本特征也被提取。使用支持向量机（SVM）和神经网络对融合以及独立特征进行分类。所获得的结果能够跨验证数据集上的基线提供17％的音频特征和24.5％的视频特征。
