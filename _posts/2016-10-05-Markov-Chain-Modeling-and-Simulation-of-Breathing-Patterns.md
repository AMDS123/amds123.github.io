##### Abstract
The lack of large video databases obtained from real patients with respiratory disorders makes the design and optimization of video-based monitoring systems quite critical. The purpose of this study is the development of suitable models and simulators of breathing behaviors and disorders, such as respiratory pauses and apneas, in order to allow efficient design and test of video-based monitoring systems. More precisely, a novel Continuous-Time Markov Chain (CTMC) statistical model of breathing patterns is presented. The Respiratory Rate (RR) pattern, estimated by measured vital signs of hospital-monitored patients, is approximated as a CTMC, whose states and parameters are selected through an appropriate statistical analysis. Then, two simulators, software- and hardware-based, are proposed. After validation of the CTMC model, the proposed simulators are tested with previously developed video-based algorithms for the estimation of the RR and the detection of apnea events. Examples of application to assess the performance of systems for video-based RR estimation and apnea detection are presented. The results, in terms of Kullback-Leibler divergence, show that realistic breathing patterns, including specific respiratory disorders, can be accurately described by the proposed model; moreover, the simulators are able to reproduce practical breathing patterns for video analysis. The presented CTMC statistical model can be strategic to describe realistic breathing patterns and devise simulators useful to develop and test novel and effective video processing-based monitoring systems.

由真实呼吸系统疾病患者获得的大型视频数据库的缺乏使得基于视频的监测系统的设计和优化变得非常关键。本研究的目的是开发呼吸暂停和呼吸暂停等呼吸行为和障碍的合适模型和模拟器，以便有效地设计和测试基于视频的监测系统。更准确地说，提出了一种新颖的呼吸模式的连续时间马尔可夫链（CTMC）统计模型。通过医院监测患者的生命体征测量评估的呼吸频率（RR）模式近似为CTMC，其状态和参数通过适当的统计分析来选择。然后，提出了两个模拟器，基于软件和硬件。在验证了CTMC模型之后，所提出的模拟器用先前开发的基于视频的算法进行测试，以评估RR和呼吸暂停事件的检测。介绍了评估基于视频的RR估计和呼吸暂停检测系统性能的应用实例。就Kullback-Leibler散度而言，结果表明，实际的呼吸模式，包括特定的呼吸障碍，可以通过所提出的模型准确地描述;此外，模拟器能够重现实际的呼吸模式进行视频分析。所提出的CTMC统计模型对于描述逼真的呼吸模式和设计可用于开发和测试新颖有效的基于视频处理的监测系统的模拟器具有战略意义。
