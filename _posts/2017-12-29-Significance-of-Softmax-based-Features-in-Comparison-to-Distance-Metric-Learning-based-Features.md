##### Abstract
The extraction of useful deep features is important for many computer vision tasks. Deep features extracted from classification networks have proved to perform well in those tasks. To obtain features of greater usefulness, end-to-end distance metric learning (DML) has been applied to train the feature extractor directly. However, in these DML studies, there were no equitable comparisons between features extracted from a DML-based network and those from a softmax-based network. In this paper, by presenting objective comparisons between these two approaches under the same network architecture, we show that the softmax-based features perform competitive, or even better, to the state-of-the-art DML features when the size of the dataset, that is, the number of training samples per class, is large. The results suggest that softmax-based features should be properly taken into account when evaluating the performance of deep features.

有用的深度特征的提取对许多计算机视觉任务是重要的。从分类网络提取的深度特征已被证明在这些任务中表现良好。为了获得更有用的特征，端对端距离度量学习（DML）已经被应用于直接训练特征提取器。然而，在这些DML研究中，从基于DML的网络提取的特征与基于softmax的网络提取的特征没有公平的比较。在本文中，通过在相同的网络架构下对这两种方法进行客观的比较，我们发现基于softmax的特征在数据集大小的情况下对最先进的DML特征具有竞争力甚至更好也就是说，每班的培训样本数量很大。结果表明，当评估深度特征的性能时，应当适当考虑基于softmax的特征。
