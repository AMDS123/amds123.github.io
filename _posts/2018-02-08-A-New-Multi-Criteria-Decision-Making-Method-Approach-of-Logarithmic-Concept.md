##### Abstract
The primary aim of the study is to introduce APLOCO method which is developed for the solution of multicriteria decision making problems both theoretically and practically. In this context, application subject of APLACO constitutes evaluation of investment potential of different cities in metropolitan status in Turkey. The secondary purpose of the study is to identify the independent variables affecting the factories in the operating phase and to estimate the effect levels of independent variables on the dependent variable in the organized industrial zones (OIZs), whose mission is to reduce regional development disparities and to mobilize local production dynamics. For this purpose, the effect levels of independent variables on dependent variables have been determined using the multilayer perceptron (MLP) method, which has a wide use in artificial neural networks (ANNs). The effect levels derived from MLP have been then used as the weight levels of the decision criteria in APLOCO. The independent variables included in MLP are also used as the decision criteria in APLOCO. According to the results obtained from APLOCO, Istanbul city is the best alternative in term of the investment potential and other alternatives are Manisa, Denizli, Izmir, Kocaeli, Bursa, Ankara, Adana, and Antalya, respectively. Although APLOCO is used to solve the ranking problem in order to show application process in the paper, it can be employed easily in the solution of classification and selection problems. On the other hand, the study also shows a rare example of the nested usage of APLOCO which is one of the methods of operation research as well as MLP used in determination of weights.

该研究的主要目的是介绍APLOCO方法，该方法是在理论和实践上为解决多准则决策问题而开发的。在此背景下，APLACO的应用主题构成对土耳其大都市地区不同城市投资潜力的评估。研究的次要目的是确定影响工厂运营阶段的独立变量，并估算有组织工业区（OIZs）中独立变量对因变量的影响程度，其使命是减少区域发展差距和调动当地生产动态。为此，自变量对因变量的影响程度已经用多层感知器（MLP）方法确定，该方法在人工神经网络（ANN）中有着广泛的应用。然后将MLP得出的效应水平用作APLOCO决策标准的权重水平。包含在MLP中的自变量也被用作APLOCO的决策标准。根据APLOCO的结果，伊斯坦布尔市是投资潜力最好的选择，其他替代品分别是马尼萨，代尼兹利，伊兹密尔，科贾埃利，布尔萨，安卡拉，阿达纳和安塔利亚。虽然APLOCO被用来解决排名问题以便在论文中显示申请流程，但它可以很容易地用于分类和选择问题的解决方案中。另一方面，该研究还显示了一个罕见的APLOCO使用方法，这是操作研究方法之一，也是用于确定权重的MLP。
