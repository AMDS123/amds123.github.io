##### Abstract
The theory introduced, presented and developed in this paper, is concerned with Rough Concept Analysis. This theory is a synthesis of the theory of Rough Sets pioneered by Zdzislaw Pawlak with the theory of Formal Concept Analysis pioneered by Rudolf Wille. The central notion in this paper of a rough formal concept combines in a natural fashion the notion of a rough set with the notion of a formal concept: "rough set + formal concept = rough formal concept". A follow-up paper will provide a synthesis of the two important data modeling techniques: conceptual scaling of Formal Concept Analysis and Entity-Relationship database modeling.
