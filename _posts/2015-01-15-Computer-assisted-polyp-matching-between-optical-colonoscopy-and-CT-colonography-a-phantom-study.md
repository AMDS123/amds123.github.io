##### Abstract
Potentially precancerous polyps detected with CT colonography (CTC) need to be removed subsequently, using an optical colonoscope (OC). Due to large colonic deformations induced by the colonoscope, even very experienced colonoscopists find it difficult to pinpoint the exact location of the colonoscope tip in relation to polyps reported on CTC. This can cause unduly prolonged OC examinations that are stressful for the patient, colonoscopist and supporting staff. We developed a method, based on monocular 3D reconstruction from OC images, that automatically matches polyps observed in OC with polyps reported on prior CTC. A matching cost is computed, using rigid point-based registration between surface point clouds extracted from both modalities. A 3D printed and painted phantom of a 25 cm long transverse colon segment was used to validate the method on two medium sized polyps. Results indicate that the matching cost is smaller at the correct corresponding polyp between OC and CTC: the value is 3.9 times higher at the incorrect polyp, comparing the correct match between polyps to the incorrect match. Furthermore, we evaluate the matching of the reconstructed polyp from OC with other colonic endoluminal surface structures such as haustral folds and show that there is a minimum at the correct polyp from CTC. Automated matching between polyps observed at OC and prior CTC would facilitate the biopsy or removal of true-positive pathology or exclusion of false-positive CTC findings, and would reduce colonoscopy false-negative (missed) polyps. Ultimately, such a method might reduce healthcare costs, patient inconvenience and discomfort.

CT结肠造影检出的潜在癌前息肉（CTC）需要随后用光学结肠镜（OC）去除。由于结肠镜诱发的大的结肠变形，即使是非常有经验的结肠镜专家也发现难以确定结肠镜尖端与CTC报道的息肉相关的确切位置。这可能导致对患者，结肠镜检查员和辅助人员造成压力的过度的OC检查。我们开发了一种基于OC图像的单眼三维重建的方法，其自动匹配在OC中观察到的息肉与在先前的CTC上报告的息肉。使用从两种形式提取的表面点云之间的基于刚性点的配准来计算匹配成本。一个25厘米长的横向结肠段3D打印和绘制幻影被用来验证两种中型息肉的方法。结果表明，OC和CTC之间正确的相应息肉的匹配成本较小：不正确的息肉的价值是3.9倍，比较息肉与错误匹配之间的正确匹配。此外，我们评估重建息肉从OC与其他结肠腔内表面结构，如海绵皱褶匹配，并表明在CTC正确的息肉有一个最低限度。在OC和之前的CTC观察到的息肉之间的自动匹配将促进活检或去除真阳性病理或排除假阳性CTC结果，并且会减少结肠镜检查的假阴性（错过的）息肉。最终，这样的方法可能会降低医疗成本，病人的不便和不适。
