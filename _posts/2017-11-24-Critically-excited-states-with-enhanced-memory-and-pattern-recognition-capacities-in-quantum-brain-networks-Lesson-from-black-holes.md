##### Abstract
We implement a mechanism - originally proposed as a model for the large memory storage capacity of black holes - in quantum neural networks and show that an exponentially increased capacity of pattern storage and recognition is achieved in certain critically excited states, without involvement of synaptic plasticity. We consider a simple network of N interconnected quantum neurons with weak excitatory synaptic connections. We show that for frozen synaptic weights there exist the critical states of enhanced memory storage capacity. These states are achieved thanks to the high excitation levels of some of the neurons, which - despite of feeble synaptic connections - dramatically lower the response threshold of the remaining weaker-excited neurons. As a results, the latter neurons acquire a capacity to store an exponentially large number of patterns within a narrow energy gap. The stored patterns can be recognized and retrieved with perfect response under the influence of arbitrarily soft input stimuli. In sharp contrast, under the same stimuli the recall is absent in the ground-state of the system. The lesson is that the state with the highest micro-state entropy and memory storage capacity is not necessarily a local minimum of energy, but rather an excited critical state. The considered phenomenon has a smooth classical limit and can serve for achieving an enhanced memory storage capacity in classical brain networks.

在量子神经网络中，我们实现了一种机制 - 最初被提出作为黑洞的大存储容量模型 - 并且表明，在某些临界激发态下，模式存储和识别的能力呈指数增长，而没有突触可塑性。我们考虑一个简单的N个相互联系的量子神经元网络，其兴奋性突触联系较弱。我们表明，对于冷冻突触权重，存在增强的内存存储容量的关键状态。这些状态是由于一些神经元的高激发水平而实现的，尽管有微弱的突触联系，但它们大大降低了其余较弱兴奋神经元的响应阈值。结果，后者的神经元获得了在狭窄的能隙内存储指数级大量模式的能力。在任意软输入刺激的影响下，所存储的模式可以被完美的反应识别和检索。与此形成鲜明对比的是，在相同的刺激下，召回在系统的基础状态中是不存在的。教训是，具有最高微观状态熵和记忆储存能力的状态不一定是能量的局部最小值，而是激发临界状态。所考虑的现象具有平滑的经典极限，并且可以用于在古典脑网络中实现增强的存储器存储容量。
