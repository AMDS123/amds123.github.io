##### Abstract
In the field of fusing multi-spectral and panchromatic images (Pan-sharpening), the impressive effectiveness of deep neural networks has been recently employed to overcome the drawbacks of traditional linear models and boost the fusing accuracy. However, to the best of our knowledge, existing research works are mainly based on simple and flat networks with relatively shallow architecture, which severely limited their performances. In this paper, the concept of residual learning has been introduced to form a very deep convolutional neural network to make a full use of the high non-linearity of deep learning models. By both quantitative and visual assessments on a large number of high quality multi-spectral images from various sources, it has been supported that our proposed model is superior to all mainstream algorithms included in the comparison, and achieved the highest spatial-spectral unified accuracy.

在融合多光谱和全色图像（泛锐化）的领域中，最近采用了深度神经网络的有效性，以克服传统线性模型的缺点，提高融合精度。然而，据我们所知，现有的研究工作主要是基于简单而扁​​平化的网络，相对较浅的结构，严重限制了它们的性能。本文引入残差学习的概念，形成深度卷积神经网络，充分利用深度学习模型的高度非线性。通过对来自不同来源的大量高质量多光谱图像进行定量和可视化评估，得到了支持，我们提出的模型优于比较中包含的所有主流算法，并获得了最高的空间光谱统一精度。
