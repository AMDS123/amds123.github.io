##### Abstract
The splendid success of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) in computer vision is largely attributed to the availability of large annotated datasets, such as ImageNet and Places. However, in biomedical imaging, it is very challenging to create such large annotated datasets, as annotating biomedical images is not only tedious, laborious, and time consuming, but also demanding of costly, specialty-oriented skills, which are not easily accessible. To dramatically reduce annotation cost, this paper presents a novel method to naturally integrate active learning and transfer learning (fine-tuning) into a single framework, called AFT*, which starts directly with a pre-trained CNN to seek "worthy" samples for annotation and gradually enhance the (fine-tuned) CNN via continuous fine-tuning. We have evaluated our method in three distinct biomedical imaging applications, demonstrating that it can cut the annotation cost by at least half, in comparison with the state-of-the-art method. This performance is attributed to the several advantages derived from the advanced active, continuous learning capability of our method. Although AFT* was initially conceived in the context of computer-aided diagnosis in biomedical imaging, it is generic and applicable to many tasks in computer vision and image analysis; we illustrate the key ideas behind AFT* with the Places database for scene interpretation in natural images.

卷积神经网络（CNN）在计算机视觉领域的辉煌成就很大程度上归因于大型注释数据集（如ImageNet和Places）的可用性。然而，在生物医学成像中，创建如此大的注释数据集是非常具有挑战性的，因为注释生物医学图像不仅繁琐，费力且费时，而且要求昂贵的，以专业为导向的技术，这些技术不易获得。为了大幅降低注释成本，本文提出了一种将主动学习和传递学习（微调）自然地集成到一个单一的框架中的方法，称为AFT *，它直接以预先训练的CNN开始寻找“有价值的”样本通过不断的微调逐步增强（微调）CNN。我们已经在三种不同的生物医学成像应用中评估了我们的方法，证明它可以将注释成本降低至少一半，与最先进的方法相比。这种表现归功于我们的方法的先进的主动，持续学习能力所带来的几个优点。尽管AFT *最初是在生物医学成像的计算机辅助诊断的背景下设计的，但是它是通用的并且适用于计算机视觉和图像分析中的许多任务;我们用自然图像中的场景数据库来解释AFT背后的关键思想。
