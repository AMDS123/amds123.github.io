##### Abstract
Attention mechanisms have been widely used in Visual Question Answering (VQA) solutions due to their capacity to model deep cross-domain interactions. Analyzing attention maps offers us a perspective to find out limitations of current VQA systems and an opportunity to further improve them. In this paper, we select two state-of-the-art VQA approaches with attention mechanisms to study their robustness and disadvantages by visualizing and analyzing their estimated attention maps. We find that both methods are sensitive to features, and simultaneously, they perform badly for counting and multi-object related questions. We believe that the findings and analytical method will help researchers identify crucial challenges on the way to improve their own VQA systems.
