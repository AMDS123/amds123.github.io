##### Abstract
The current study applies deep learning to herbalism. Toward the goal, we acquired the de-identified health insurance reimbursements that were claimed in a 10-year period from 2004 to 2013 in the National Health Insurance Database of Taiwan, the total number of reimbursement records equaling 340 millions. Two artificial intelligence techniques were applied to the dataset: residual convolutional neural network multitask classifier and attention-based recurrent neural network. The former works to translate from herbal prescriptions to diseases; and the latter from diseases to herbal prescriptions. Analysis of the classification results indicates that herbal prescriptions are specific to: anatomy, pathophysiology, sex and age of the patient, and season and year of the prescription. Further analysis identifies temperature and gross domestic product as the meteorological and socioeconomic factors that are associated with herbal prescriptions. Analysis of the neural machine transitional result indicates that the recurrent neural network learnt not only syntax but also semantics of diseases and herbal prescriptions.

目前的研究将深度学习应用于草药学。为实现这一目标，我们在台湾国民健康保险数据库中获得了2004年至2013年10年间取消确认的医疗保险报销总额为3.4亿的报销记录。对数据集应用两种人工智能技术：残余卷积神经网络多任务分类器和基于注意的递归神经网络。前者的工作是从草药处方转化为疾病;后者从疾病到草药处方。分类结果分析表明，草药处方具体针对：解剖学，病理生理学，患者的性别和年龄，以及处方的季节和年份。进一步分析将温度和国内生产总值（GDP）确定为与草药处方相关的气象和社会经济因素。神经机器过渡结果分析表明，递归神经网络不仅学习了语法，而且学习了疾病和草药处方的语义。
