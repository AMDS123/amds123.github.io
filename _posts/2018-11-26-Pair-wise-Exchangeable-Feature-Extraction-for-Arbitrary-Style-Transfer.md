##### Abstract
Style transfer has been an important topic in both computer vision and graphics. Gatys et al. first prove that deep features extracted by the pre-trained VGG network represent both content and style features of an image and hence, style transfer can be achieved through optimization in feature space. Huang et al. then show that real-time arbitrary style transfer can be done by simply aligning the mean and variance of each feature channel. In this paper, however, we argue that only aligning the global statistics of deep features cannot always guarantee a good style transfer. Instead, we propose to jointly analyze the input image pair and extract common/exchangeable style features between the two. Besides, a new fusion mode is developed for combining content and style information in feature space. Qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate the advantages of our approach.
