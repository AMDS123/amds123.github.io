##### Abstract
Painting is an art form that has long functioned as major channel for communication and creative expression. Understanding how painting has evolved over the centuries is therefore an essential component for understanding cultural history, intricately linked with developments in aesthetics, science, and technology. The explosive growth in the ranges of stylistic diversity in painting starting in the nineteenth century, for example, is understood to be the hallmark of a stark departure from traditional norms on multidisciplinary fronts. Yet, there exist few quantitative frameworks that allow us to characterize such developments on an extensive scale, which would require both robust statistical methods for quantifying the complexities of artistic styles and data of sufficient quality and quantity to which we can fruitfully apply them. Here we propose an analytical framework that allows us to capture the stylistic evolution of paintings based on the color contrast relationships that also incorporates the geometric separation between pixels of images in a large-scale archive of 179,853 images. We first measure how paintings have evolved over time, and then characterize the remarkable explosive growth in diversity and individuality in the modern era. Our analysis demonstrates how robust scientific methods married with large-scale, high-quality data can reveal interesting patterns that lie behind the complexities of art and culture.

##### Abstract (translated by Google)
绘画是长久以来作为沟通和创造性表达的主要渠道的艺术形式。了解数百年来绘画如何发展是理解文化历史的重要组成部分，与美学，科学和技术的发展有着千丝万缕的联系。例如，从十九世纪开始，绘画风格多样性的爆炸性增长被理解为与多学科战线上的传统规范截然不同的标志。然而，目前还没有一个量化的框架可以让我们对这样的发展进行大规模的描述，这需要强有力的统计方法来量化艺术风格的复杂性和足够的质量和数量。在这里，我们提出了一个分析框架，使我们能够捕捉基于颜色对比关系的绘画的风格演变，这种关系还包含179,853幅图像的大型档案中的图像像素之间的几何分离。我们首先衡量绘画是如何随着时间而演变的，然后刻画现代时代显着的多样性和个性的爆炸性增长。我们的分析表明，结合大规模，高质量数据的强大的科学方法可以揭示艺术和文化复杂背后的有趣模式。
