##### Abstract
Pedestrian attribute recognition has attracted many attentions due to its wide applications in scene understanding and person analysis from surveillance videos. Existing methods try to use additional pose, part or viewpoint information to complement the global feature representation for attribute classification. However, these methods face difficulties in localizing the areas corresponding to different attributes. To address this problem, we propose a novel Localization Guided Network which assigns attribute-specific weights to local features based on the affinity between proposals pre-extracted proposals and attribute locations. The advantage of our model is that our local features are learned automatically for each attribute and emphasized by the interaction with global features. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our Localization Guided Network on two pedestrian attribute benchmarks (PA-100K and RAP). Our result surpasses the previous state-of-the-art in all five metrics on both datasets.

行人属性识别因其在场景理解和监控视频人员分析中的广泛应用而备受关注。现有方法试图使用附加的姿势，部分或视点信息来补充属性分类的全局特征表示。然而，这些方法在定位对应于不同属性的区域方面面临困难。为了解决这个问题，我们提出了一种新颖的本地化引导网络，它基于提取前提议和属性位置之间的关联，为本地特征分配属性特定权重。我们模型的优势在于我们可以自动学习每个属性的本地特征，并通过与全局特征的交互来强调这些特征。我们在两个行人属性基准（PA-100K和RAP）上展示了我们的本地化引导网络的有效性。我们的结果超过了两个数据集中所有五个指标的先前技术水平。
