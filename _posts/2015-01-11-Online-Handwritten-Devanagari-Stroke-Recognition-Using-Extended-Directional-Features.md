##### Abstract
This paper describes a new feature set, called the extended directional features (EDF) for use in the recognition of online handwritten strokes. We use EDF specifically to recognize strokes that form a basis for producing Devanagari script, which is the most widely used Indian language script. It should be noted that stroke recognition in handwritten script is equivalent to phoneme recognition in speech signals and is generally very poor and of the order of 20% for singing voice. Experiments are conducted for the automatic recognition of isolated handwritten strokes. Initially we describe the proposed feature set, namely EDF and then show how this feature can be effectively utilized for writer independent script recognition through stroke recognition. Experimental results show that the extended directional feature set performs well with about 65+% stroke level recognition accuracy for writer independent data set.

本文描述了一种新的特征集，称为扩展方向特征（EDF），用于识别在线手写笔画。我们特意使用EDF来识别构成梵文剧本的基础，这是使用最广泛的印度语剧本。应该指出的是，手写脚本中的笔画识别相当于语音信号中的音素识别，一般来说非常差，对于歌唱声音来说大约为20％。进行实验以自动识别孤立的手写笔画。最初我们描述提出的特征集，即EDF，然后展示如何通过笔划识别有效地利用这个特征来实现作者独立的脚本识别。实验结果表明，扩展方向特征集对笔式独立数据集具有约65 +％的笔画级别识别精度。
