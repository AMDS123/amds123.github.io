##### Abstract
Detecting compact objects by means of their gravitational lensing effect on an observed companion in a binary system has already been suggested almost four decades ago. However, these predictions were made even before the first observations of gravitational lensing, whereas nowadays gravitational microlensing surveys towards the Galactic bulge yield almost 1000 events per year where one star magnifies the light of a more distant one. With a specific view on those experiments, we therefore carry out simulations to assess the prospects for detection of the transient periodic magnification of the companion star, which lasts typically only a few hours binaries involving a main-sequence star. We find that detectability is given by the achievability of dense monitoring with the required photometric accuracy. In sharp contrast to earlier expectations by other authors, we find that main-sequence stars are not substantially less favourable targets to observe this effect than white dwarfs. The requirement of an almost edge-on orbit leads to a probability of the order of $3 \times 10^{-4}$ for spotting the signature of an existing compact object in a binary system with this technique. Assuming an abundance of such systems about 0.4 per cent, a high-cadence monitoring every 15~min with 5 per cent photometric accuracy would deliver a signal rate per target star of $\gamma \sim 4 \times 10^{-7}~\mbox{yr}^{-1}$ at a recurrence period of about 6 months. With microlensing surveys having demonstrated the capability to monitor about $2 \times 10^{8}$ stars, one is therefore provided with the chance to detect roughly semi-annually recurring self-lensing signals from several compact compacts in a binary system. If the photometric accuracy was pushed down to 0.3 per cent, 10 times as many signals would become detectable.

在一个二进制系统中，通过对观察到的伴侣的引力透镜效应来检测紧凑物体已经在近四十年前被提出。然而，这些预测甚至在第一次观测到引力透镜之前就已经完成了，而现在对银河凸起的重力微透镜调查每年产生近1000个事件，其中一颗恒星放大了更远的一颗恒星的光。通过对这些实验的具体看法，我们进行模拟以评估伴星的瞬态周期性放大率的检测前景，伴星恒星通常只有几个小时的二进制数，涉及一个主序星。我们发现可检测性是由所需的光度准确度的密集监测的可实现性给出的。与其他作者的早期预期形成鲜明对比，我们发现主序星并不比白矮星更不利于观测这种效应。几乎在边缘在轨道上的要求导致用这种技术在二进制系统中发现现有紧凑对象的签名的概率为$ 3 \ times 10 ^ { -  4} $。假设这种系统的数量大约为0.4％，那么每15分钟进行一次高频率的监测，测量精度为5％，这样每个目标恒星的信号速率就可以达到每秒10 ^  -  7〜 \ mbox {yr} ^ { -  1} $，重现期约为6个月。通过微透镜测量已经证明能够监测大约2×10 8星的星，因此提供了一个机会来检测来自二进制系统中几个紧凑型压缩机的大致半年一次的重复自透镜信号。如果测光精度下降到0.3％，那么可以检测到10倍的信号。
