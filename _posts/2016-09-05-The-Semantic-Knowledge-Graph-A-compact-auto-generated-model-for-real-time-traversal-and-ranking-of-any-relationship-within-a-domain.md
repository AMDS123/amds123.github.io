##### Abstract
This paper describes a new kind of knowledge representation and mining system which we are calling the Semantic Knowledge Graph. At its heart, the Semantic Knowledge Graph leverages an inverted index, along with a complementary uninverted index, to represent nodes (terms) and edges (the documents within intersecting postings lists for multiple terms/nodes). This provides a layer of indirection between each pair of nodes and their corresponding edge, enabling edges to materialize dynamically from underlying corpus statistics. As a result, any combination of nodes can have edges to any other nodes materialize and be scored to reveal latent relationships between the nodes. This provides numerous benefits: the knowledge graph can be built automatically from a real-world corpus of data, new nodes - along with their combined edges - can be instantly materialized from any arbitrary combination of preexisting nodes (using set operations), and a full model of the semantic relationships between all entities within a domain can be represented and dynamically traversed using a highly compact representation of the graph. Such a system has widespread applications in areas as diverse as knowledge modeling and reasoning, natural language processing, anomaly detection, data cleansing, semantic search, analytics, data classification, root cause analysis, and recommendations systems. The main contribution of this paper is the introduction of a novel system - the Semantic Knowledge Graph - which is able to dynamically discover and score interesting relationships between any arbitrary combination of entities (words, phrases, or extracted concepts) through dynamically materializing nodes and edges from a compact graphical representation built automatically from a corpus of data representative of a knowledge domain.

本文描述了一种称为语义知识图的新型知识表示和挖掘系统。在其核心，语义知识图利用倒排索引以及互补的未倒排索引来表示节点（项）和边（多个项/节点的相交发布列表内的文档）。这为每对节点及其相应的边之间提供了一个间接的层，使边能够从底层语料库统计中动态地实现。结果，节点的任何组合都可以具有到任何其他节点的边缘，并被评分以揭示节点之间的潜在关系。这提供了许多好处：知识图可以从现实世界的数据库中自动构建，新的节点及其组合边可以从任何已有节点的任意组合（使用集合操作）立即实现，可以使用图的高度紧凑的表示来表示和动态遍历域内的所有实体之间的语义关系的模型。这样的系统在知识建模和推理，自然语言处理，异常检测，数据清理，语义搜索，分析，数据分类，根本原因分析和推荐系统等方面具有广泛的应用。本文的主要贡献在于引入了一个新的系统 - 语义知识图，它能够通过动态实现节点和边来动态地发现和评分任意实体组合（词，短语或提取的概念）之间的有趣关系从代表知识领域的数据语料库自动构建的紧凑图形表示。
