##### Abstract
We present an approach to learning features that represent the local geometry around a point in an unstructured point cloud. Such features play a central role in geometric registration, which supports diverse applications in robotics and 3D vision. Current state-of-the-art local features for unstructured point clouds have been manually crafted and none combines the desirable properties of precision, compactness, and robustness. We show that features with these properties can be learned from data, by optimizing deep networks that map high-dimensional histograms into low-dimensional Euclidean spaces. The presented approach yields a family of features, parameterized by dimension, that are both more compact and more accurate than existing descriptors.

##### Abstract (translated by Google)
我们提出一种方法来学习代表非结构化点云周围点的局部几何的特征。这些特征在几何配准中起着核心作用，支持机器人和三维视觉的多种应用。非结构化点云的当前最先进的局部特征已经被手工制作，并且没有结合精度，紧凑性和鲁棒性的期望特性。我们表明，通过优化将高维直方图映射到低维欧几里得空间的深层网络，可以从数据中学习具有这些属性的特征。所提出的方法产生了一系列按维度参数化的特征，它们比现有的描述符更紧凑和更准确。
