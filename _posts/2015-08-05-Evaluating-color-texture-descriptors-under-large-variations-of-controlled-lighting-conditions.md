##### Abstract
The recognition of color texture under varying lighting conditions is still an open issue. Several features have been proposed for this purpose, ranging from traditional statistical descriptors to features extracted with neural networks. Still, it is not completely clear under what circumstances a feature performs better than the others. In this paper we report an extensive comparison of old and new texture features, with and without a color normalization step, with a particular focus on how they are affected by small and large variation in the lighting conditions. The evaluation is performed on a new texture database including 68 samples of raw food acquired under 46 conditions that present single and combined variations of light color, direction and intensity. The database allows to systematically investigate the robustness of texture descriptors across a large range of variations of imaging conditions.

在不同照明条件下对颜色纹理的识别仍然是一个悬而未决的问题。已经为此提出了几个特征，从传统的统计描述符到用神经网络提取的特征。但是，在哪些情况下，某个功能比其他功能表现得更好还不完全清楚。在本文中，我们报告了新旧纹理特征的广泛比较，有和没有颜色标准化步骤，特别关注它们如何受光照条件中的小的和大的变化的影响。评估是在一个新的纹理数据库上进行的，这个数据库包括了在46种条件下获得的68种生食品的样品，这些样品呈现单一的光色，方向和强度的变化。该数据库允许在大范围的成像条件变化中系统地研究纹理描述符的鲁棒性。
