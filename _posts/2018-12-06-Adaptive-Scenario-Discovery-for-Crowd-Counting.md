##### Abstract
Crowd counting, i.e., estimation number of pedestrian in crowd images, is emerging as an important research problem with the public security applications. A key ingredient in the design of crowd counting systems is the construction of counting models while being robust to various scenarios under facts such as camera perspective and physical barriers. In this paper, we present an adaptive scenario discovery framework for crowd counting. The system is structured with two parallel pathways that are trained with different sizes of receptive field to represent different scales and crowd densities. After ensuring that these components are present in the proper geometric configuration, a third branch is designed to adaptively recalibrate the pathway-wise responses by discovering and modeling the dynamic scenarios implicitly. Our system is able to represent highly variable crowd images and achieves state-of-the-art results in two challenging benchmarks.
