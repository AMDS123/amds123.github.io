##### Abstract
There is a need for systems to dynamically interact with ageing populations to gather information, monitor health condition and provide support, especially after hospital discharge or at-home settings. Several smart devices have been delivered by digital health, bundled with telemedicine systems, smartphone and other digital services. While such solutions offer personalised data and suggestions, the real disruptive step comes from the interaction of new digital ecosystem, represented by chatbots. Chatbots will play a leading role by embodying the function of a virtual assistant and bridging the gap between patients and clinicians. Powered by AI and machine learning algorithms, chatbots are forecasted to save healthcare costs when used in place of a human or assist them as a preliminary step of helping to assess a condition and providing self-care recommendations. This paper describes integrating chatbots into telemedicine systems intended for elderly patient after their hospital discharge. The paper discusses possible ways to utilise chatbots to assist healthcare providers and support patients with their condition.

##### Abstract (translated by Google)
系统需要与老龄化人群动态交互以收集信息，监测健康状况并提供支持，尤其是在出院或家中环境之后。数字医疗已经提供了几种智能设备，与远程医疗系统，智能手机和其他数字服务捆绑在一起。尽管这些解决方案提供了个性化的数据和建议，但真正的颠覆性步骤来自以chatbots为代表的新数字生态系统的互动。 Chatbots将通过体现虚拟助理的功能并缩小患者与临床医生之间的差距来发挥主导作用。通过AI和机器学习算法，预测聊天机器人可以节省医疗保健成本，以此代替人类使用，或帮助他们作为帮助评估病情和提供自我护理建议的初步步骤。本文介绍了将聊天机器人出院后整合到面向老年患者的远程医疗系统中。本文讨论了利用聊天机器人协助医疗服务提供者并支持患者病情的可能方式。
