##### Abstract
This paper describes a dataset containing small images of text from everyday scenes. The purpose of the dataset is to support the development of new automated systems that can detect and analyze text. Although much research has been devoted to text detection and recognition in scanned documents, relatively little attention has been given to text detection in other types of images, such as photographs that are posted on social-media sites. This new dataset, known as COCO-Text-Patch, contains approximately 354,000 small images that are each labeled as "text" or "non-text". This dataset particularly addresses the problem of text verification, which is an essential stage in the end-to-end text detection and recognition pipeline. In order to evaluate the utility of this dataset, it has been used to train two deep convolution neural networks to distinguish text from non-text. One network is inspired by the GoogLeNet architecture, and the second one is based on CaffeNet. Accuracy levels of 90.2% and 90.9% were obtained using the two networks, respectively. All of the images, source code, and deep-learning trained models described in this paper will be publicly available

本文描述了一个包含日常场景中小文本图像的数据集。数据集的目的是支持开发可以检测和分析文本的新型自动化系统。尽管在扫描文档中已经进行了大量的文本检测和识别研究，但是在其他类型的图像（例如在社交媒体网站上发布的照片​​）中的文本检测方面相对很少受到关注。这个新的数据集称为COCO-Text-Patch，包含大约354,000个小图像，每个小图像标记为“文本”或“非文本”。该数据集特别解决了文本验证问题，这是端到端文本检测和识别流程中的一个重要阶段。为了评估这个数据集的效用，它被用来训练两个深度卷积神经网络来区分文本和非文本。一个网络受到GoogLeNet架构的启发，另一个网络基于CaffeNet。使用这两个网络分别获得了90.2％和90.9％的准确性水平。本文中介绍的所有图像，源代码和深度学习训练模型都将公开发布
