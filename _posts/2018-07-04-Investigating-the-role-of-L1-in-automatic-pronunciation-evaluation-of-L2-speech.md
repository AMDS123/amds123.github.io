##### Abstract
Automatic pronunciation evaluation plays an important role in pronunciation training and second language education. This field draws heavily on concepts from automatic speech recognition (ASR) to quantify how close the pronunciation of non-native speech is to native-like pronunciation. However, it is known that the formation of accent is related to pronunciation patterns of both the target language (L2) and the speaker's first language (L1). In this paper, we propose to use two native speech acoustic models, one trained on L2 speech and the other trained on L1 speech. We develop two sets of measurements that can be extracted from two acoustic models given accented speech. A new utterance-level feature extraction scheme is used to convert these measurements into a fixed-dimension vector which is used as an input to a statistical model to predict the accentedness of a speaker. On a data set consisting of speakers from 4 different L1 backgrounds, we show that the proposed system yields improved correlation with human evaluators compared to systems only using the L2 acoustic model.

自动发音评估在发音训练和第二语言教育中起着重要作用。该领域在很大程度上依赖于来自自动语音识别（ASR）的概念来量化非本地语音的发音与原生语音的接近程度。然而，众所周知，重音的形成与目标语言（L2）和说话者的第一语言（L1）的发音模式有关。在本文中，我们建议使用两个本地语音声学模型，一个训练L2语音，另一个训练L1语音。我们开发了两组测量值，可以从给定重音语音的两个声学模型中提取。新的话语级特征提取方案用于将这些测量值转换为固定维度向量，该向量用作统计模型的输入以预测说话者的重音。在由4个不同L1背景的扬声器组成的数据集上，我们表明，与仅使用L2声学模型的系统相比，所提出的系统与人类评估者产生改善的相关性。
