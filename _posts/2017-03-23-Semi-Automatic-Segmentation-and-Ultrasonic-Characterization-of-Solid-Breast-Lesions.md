##### Abstract
Characterization of breast lesions is an essential prerequisite to detect breast cancer in an early stage. Automatic segmentation makes this categorization method robust by freeing it from subjectivity and human error. Both spectral and morphometric features are successfully used for differentiating between benign and malignant breast lesions. In this thesis, we used empirical mode decomposition method for semi-automatic segmentation. Sonographic features like ehcogenicity, heterogeneity, FNPA, margin definition, Hurst coefficient, compactness, roundness, aspect ratio, convexity, solidity, form factor were calculated to be used as our characterization parameters. All of these parameters did not give desired comparative results. But some of them namely echogenicity, heterogeneity, margin definition, aspect ratio and convexity gave good results and were used for characterization.

##### Abstract (translated by Google)
乳腺病变的特征化是早期检测乳腺癌的基本前提。自动分割使得这种分类方法更加健壮，使其免于主观性和人为错误。光谱和形态学特征都成功用于区分良性和恶性乳腺病变。本文采用经验模式分解方法进行半自动分割。计算生殖性，异质性，FNPA，边界清晰度，Hurst系数，致密度，圆度，纵横比，凸度，固体度，形状因子等超声特征作为特征参数。所有这些参数都没有给出所需的比较结果。但是它们中的一些即回声性，异质性，边缘清晰度，纵横比和凸度都给出了很好的结果，并被用于表征。
