##### Abstract
Cardiovascular disease (CVD) has become the leading cause of death in China, and most of the cases can be prevented by controlling risk factors. The goal of this study was to build a corpus of CVD risk factor annotations based on Chinese electronic medical records (CEMRs). This corpus is intended to be used to develop a risk factor information extraction system that, in turn, can be applied as a foundation for the further study of the progress of risk factors and CVD. We designed a light annotation task to capture CVD risk factors with indicators, temporal attributes and assertions that were explicitly or implicitly displayed in the records. The task included: 1) preparing data; 2) creating guidelines for capturing annotations (these were created with the help of clinicians); 3) proposing an annotation method including building the guidelines draft, training the annotators and updating the guidelines, and corpus construction. Then, a risk factor annotated corpus based on de-identified discharge summaries and progress notes from 600 patients was developed. Built with the help of clinicians, this corpus has an inter-annotator agreement (IAA) F1-measure of 0.968, indicating a high reliability. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first annotated corpus concerning CVD risk factors in CEMRs and the guidelines for capturing CVD risk factor annotations from CEMRs were proposed. The obtained document-level annotations can be applied in future studies to monitor risk factors and CVD over the long term.

心血管疾病（CVD）已经成为中国的主要死亡原因，大多数病例可以通过控制危险因素来预防。这项研究的目标是建立一个基于中国电子病历（CEMRs）的CVD风险因素注释的语料库。这个语料库是用来开发一个风险因素信息提取系统，反过来，可以作为进一步研究风险因素和CVD的进展的基础。我们设计了一个轻量级注释任务，以捕获记录中明确或隐含显示的指标，时态属性和断言的CVD风险因子。任务包括：1）准备数据; 2）创建捕获注释的指南（这些是在临床医生的帮助下创建的）; 3）提出一个注释方法，包括构建指导草案，培训注释者，更新指导方针，建立语料库。然后，根据600名患者的未确定的出院总结和进展情况，制定了一个危险因素注释的语料库。在临床医生的帮助下，该语料库具有0.968的内部注释者协议（IAA）F1-度量，表明了高可靠性。就我们所知，这是第一个关于CEMR中心血管疾病危险因素的注释语料库，并提出了CEMR中CVD危险因素注释的指导原则。所获得的文件级别的注释可应用于未来的研究，以长期监测风险因素和心血管疾病。
