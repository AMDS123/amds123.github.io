##### Abstract
This survey aims at reviewing recent computer vision techniques used in the assessment of image aesthetic quality. Image aesthetic assessment aims at computationally distinguishing high-quality photos from low-quality ones based on photographic rules, typically in the form of binary classification or quality scoring. A variety of approaches has been proposed in the literature trying to solve this challenging problem. In this survey, we present a systematic listing of the reviewed approaches based on visual feature types (hand-crafted features and deep features) and evaluation criteria (dataset characteristics and evaluation metrics). Main contributions and novelties of the reviewed approaches are highlighted and discussed. In addition, following the emergence of deep learning techniques, we systematically evaluate recent deep learning settings that are useful for developing a robust deep model for aesthetic scoring. Experiments are conducted using simple yet solid baselines that are competitive with the current state-of-the-arts. Moreover, we discuss the possibility of manipulating the aesthetics of images through computational approaches. We hope that our survey could serve as a comprehensive reference source for future research on the study of image aesthetic assessment.

本次调查旨在回顾评估图像美学质量时使用的最新计算机视觉技术。图像美学评估旨在根据摄影规则计算区分高质量照片和低质量照片，通常以二进制分类或质量评分的形式。文献中已经提出了各种方法来试图解决这个具有挑战性的问题。在本次调查中，我们将基于视觉特征类型（手工特征和深度特征）和评估标准（数据集特征和评估指标）的评估方法进行了系统的列表。重点讨论了所审议方法的主要贡献和新颖性。此外，随着深度学习技术的出现，我们系统地评估了最近的深度学习设置，这对于开发一个强大的审美评分深度模型是有用的。使用简单而坚实的基线进行实验，这与现有技术水平相竞争。此外，我们讨论通过计算方法操纵图像美学的可能性。我们希望我们的调查可以作为未来研究图像审美评估研究的综合参考来源。
