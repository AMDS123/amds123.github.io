##### Abstract
Fractals2019 started as a new experimental entry in the RoboCup Soccer 2D Simulation League, based on Gliders2d code base, and advanced to a team winning RoboCup-2019 championship. Our approach is centred on combinatorial optimisation methods, within the framework of Guided Self-Organisation (GSO), with the search guided by local constraints. We present examples of several tactical tasks based on the fully released Gliders2d code (version v2), including the search for an optimal assignment of heterogeneous player types, as well as blocking behaviours, offside trap, and attacking formations. We propose a new method, Dynamic Constraint Annealing, for solving dynamic constraint satisfaction problems, and apply it to optimise thermodynamic potential of collective behaviours, under dynamically induced constraints.
