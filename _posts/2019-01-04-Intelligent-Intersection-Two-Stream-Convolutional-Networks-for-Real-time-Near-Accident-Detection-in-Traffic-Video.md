##### Abstract
In Intelligent Transportation System, real-time systems that monitor and analyze road users become increasingly critical as we march toward the smart city era. Vision-based frameworks for Object Detection, Multiple Object Tracking, and Traffic Near Accident Detection are important applications of Intelligent Transportation System, particularly in video surveillance and etc. Although deep neural networks have recently achieved great success in many computer vision tasks, a uniformed framework for all the three tasks is still challenging where the challenges multiply from demand for real-time performance, complex urban setting, highly dynamic traffic event, and many traffic movements. In this paper, we propose a two-stream Convolutional Network architecture that performs real-time detection, tracking, and near accident detection of road users in traffic video data. The two-stream model consists of a spatial stream network for Object Detection and a temporal stream network to leverage motion features for Multiple Object Tracking. We detect near accidents by incorporating appearance features and motion features from two-stream networks. Using aerial videos, we propose a Traffic Near Accident Dataset (TNAD) covering various types of traffic interactions that is suitable for vision-based traffic analysis tasks. Our experiments demonstrate the advantage of our framework with an overall competitive qualitative and quantitative performance at high frame rates on the TNAD dataset.
