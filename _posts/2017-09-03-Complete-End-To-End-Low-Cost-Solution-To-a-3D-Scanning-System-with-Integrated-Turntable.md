##### Abstract
3D reconstruction is a technique used in computer vision which has a wide range of applications in areas like object recognition, city modelling, virtual reality, physical simulations, video games and special effects. Previously, to perform a 3D reconstruction, specialized hardwares were required. Such systems were often very expensive and was only available for industrial or research purpose. With the rise of the availability of high-quality low cost 3D sensors, it is now possible to design inexpensive complete 3D scanning systems. The objective of this work was to design an acquisition and processing system that can perform 3D scanning and reconstruction of objects seamlessly. In addition, the goal of this work also included making the 3D scanning process fully automated by building and integrating a turntable alongside the software. This means the user can perform a full 3D scan only by a press of a few buttons from our dedicated graphical user interface. Three main steps were followed to go from acquisition of point clouds to the finished reconstructed 3D model. First, our system acquires point cloud data of a person/object using inexpensive camera sensor. Second, align and convert the acquired point cloud data into a watertight mesh of good quality. Third, export the reconstructed model to a 3D printer to obtain a proper 3D print of the model.

三维重建是计算机视觉技术，在物体识别，城市建模，虚拟现实，物理模拟，电子游戏和特效等领域具有广泛的应用。以前，要执行3D重建，需要专门的硬件。这种系统通常非常昂贵，只能用于工业或研究目的。随着高质量低成本3D传感器的出现，现在可以设计出廉价的完整3D扫描系统。这项工作的目的是设计一个可以无缝地执行物体三维扫描和重建的采集和处理系统。此外，这项工作的目标还包括通过与软件一起构建和集成转台来使3D扫描过程完全自动化。这意味着用户只需从我们专用的图形用户界面按下几个按钮即可执行全面的3D扫描。从获取点云到完成重构的三维模型，遵循三个主要步骤。首先，我们的系统使用廉价的相机传感器获取人物/物体的点云数据。其次，将获取的点云数据对齐并转换为质量良好的水密网格。第三，将重建的模型导出到3D打印机以获得适当的3D打印模型。
