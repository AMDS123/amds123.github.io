##### Abstract
The paper adapts the large deformation diffeomorphic metric mapping framework for image registration to the indirect setting where a template is registered against a target that is given through indirect noisy observations. The registration uses diffeomorphisms that transform the template through a (group) action. These diffeomorphisms are generated by solving a flow equation that is defined by a velocity field with certain regularity. The theoretical analysis includes a proof that indirect image registration has solutions (existence) that are stable and that converge as the data error tends so zero, so it becomes a well-defined regularization method. The paper concludes with examples of indirect image registration in 2D tomography with very sparse and/or highly noisy data.

本文将图像配准的大变形微分同胚度量映射框架应用于间接设置，即模板在间接噪声观测给定的目标上进行配准。注册使用通过（组）行为转换模板的差异同态。这些微分同胚是通过求解由具有一定规律性的速度场定义的流动方程而产生的。理论分析包括间接图像配准的解（存在性）是稳定的，并且随着数据误差趋于零而收敛，从而成为一个明确的正则化方法。本文结合二维层析成像中间接图像配准的例子，以非常稀疏和/或高度嘈杂的数据。
