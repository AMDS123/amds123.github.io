##### Abstract
We present the design of a diffraction limited, long working distance monochromatic objective lens for efficient light collection. Consisting of four spherical lenses, it has a numerical aperture of 0.29, an effective focal length of 36 mm and a working distance of 36.5 mm. This inexpensive system allows us to detect 8*10^4 fluorescence photons per second from a single cesium atom stored in a magneto-optical trap.
