##### Abstract
Sexism is very common in social media and makes the boundaries of freedom tighter for feminist and female users. There is still no comprehensive classification of sexism attracting natural language processing techniques. Categorizing sexism in social media in the categories of hostile or benevolent sexism are so general that simply ignores the other types of sexism happening in these media. This paper proposes a more comprehensive and in-depth categories of online harassment in social media e.g. twitter into the following categories, "Indirect harassment", "Information threat", "sexual harassment", "Physical harassment" and "Not sexist" and address the challenge of labeling them along with presenting the classification result of the categories. It is preliminary work applying machine learning to learn the concept of sexism and distinguishes itself by looking at more precise categories of sexism in social media.
