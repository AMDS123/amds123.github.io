##### Abstract
InGaN/GaN multiple quantum wells (MQWs) have been studied by using cathodoluminescence hyperspectral imaging with high spatial resolution. Variations in peak emission energies and intensities across trench-like features and V-pits on the surface of the MQWs are investigated. The MQW emission from the region inside trench-like features is red-shifted by approximately 45 meV and more intense than the surrounding planar regions of the sample, whereas emission from the V-pits is blue-shifted by about 20 meV and relatively weaker. By employing this technique to the studied nanostructures it is possible to investigate energy and intensity shifts on a 10 nm length scale.
