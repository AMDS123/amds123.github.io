##### Abstract
InGaN/GaN multiple quantum wells (MQWs) have been studied by using cathodoluminescence hyperspectral imaging with high spatial resolution. Variations in peak emission energies and intensities across trench-like features and V-pits on the surface of the MQWs are investigated. The MQW emission from the region inside trench-like features is red-shifted by approximately 45 meV and more intense than the surrounding planar regions of the sample, whereas emission from the V-pits is blue-shifted by about 20 meV and relatively weaker. By employing this technique to the studied nanostructures it is possible to investigate energy and intensity shifts on a 10 nm length scale.

利用高空间分辨率的阴极发光高光谱成像研究了InGaN / GaN多量子阱（MQWs）。研究了MQW表面上的沟状特征和V坑的峰值发射能量和强度的变化。来自沟槽状特征内的区域的MQW发射被红移大约45meV并且比样本的周围平面区域更强烈，而来自V坑的发射被蓝移大约20meV并且相对较弱。通过将这种技术应用于所研究的纳米结构，可以研究10纳米长度范围内的能量和强度变化。
