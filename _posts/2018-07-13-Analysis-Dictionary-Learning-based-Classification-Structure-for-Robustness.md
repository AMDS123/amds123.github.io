##### Abstract
A discriminative structured analysis dictionary is proposed for the classification task. A structure of the union of subspaces (UoS) is integrated into the conventional analysis dictionary learning to enhance the capability of discrimination. A simple classifier is also simultaneously included into the formulated functional to ensure a more complete consistent classification. The solution of the algorithm is efficiently obtained by the linearized alternating direction method of multipliers. Moreover, a distributed structured analysis dictionary learning is also presented to address large scale datasets. It can group-(class-) independently train the structured analysis dictionaries by different machines/cores/threads, and therefore avoid a high computational cost. A consensus structured analysis dictionary and a global classifier are jointly learned in the distributed approach to safeguard the discriminative power and the efficiency of classification. Experiments demonstrate that our method achieves a comparable or better performance than the state-of-the-art algorithms in a variety of visual classification tasks. In addition, the training and testing computational complexity are also greatly reduced.

提出了一种用于分类任务的判别结构化分析字典。子空间联合（UoS）的结构被整合到传统的分析字典中，以增强辨别能力。简单的分类器也同时包含在配方功能中，以确保更完整的一致分类。通过乘法器的线性化交替方向方法有效地获得算法的解。此外，还提出了分布式结构化分析字典学习以解决大规模数据集。它可以通过不同的机器/核心/线程对组（ - 类）独立地训练结构化分析字典，因此避免了高计算成本。在分布式方法中共同学习共识结构分析字典和全局分类器，以保护判别力和分类效率。实验表明，我们的方法在各种视觉分类任务中实现了与最先进算法相当或更好的性能。此外，培训和测试计算复杂性也大大降低。
