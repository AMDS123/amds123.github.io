##### Abstract
To meet the women appearance needs, we present a novel virtual experience approach of facial makeup transfer, developed into windows platform application software. The makeup effects could present on the user's input image in real time, with an only single reference image. The input image and reference image are divided into three layers by facial feature points landmarked: facial structure layer, facial color layer, and facial detail layer. Except for the above layers are processed by different algorithms to generate output image, we also add illumination transfer, so that the illumination effect of the reference image is automatically transferred to the input image. Our approach has the following three advantages: (1) Black or dark and white facial makeup could be effectively transferred by introducing illumination transfer; (2) Efficiently transfer facial makeup within seconds compared to those methods based on deep learning frameworks; (3) Reference images with the air-bangs could transfer makeup perfectly.
