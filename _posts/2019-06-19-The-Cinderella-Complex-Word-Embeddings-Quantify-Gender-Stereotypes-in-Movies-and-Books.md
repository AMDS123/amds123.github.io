##### Abstract
Gender norms and stereotypes are deeply rooted in society and are reinforced through the recreation of cultural products. Our analysis of thousands of novels, movie synopsis, and movie scripts reveals how these culture products promote gender stereotypes in a quiet but strong way. We start from demonstrating how the happiness of Cinderella depends on the Prince but not vice versa.
