##### Abstract
The problem of stereoscopic image quality assessment, which finds applications in 3D visual content delivery such as 3DTV, is investigated in this work. Specifically, we propose a new ParaBoost (parallel-boosting) stereoscopic image quality assessment (PBSIQA) system. The system consists of two stages. In the first stage, various distortions are classified into a few types, and individual quality scorers targeting at a specific distortion type are developed. These scorers offer complementary performance in face of a database consisting of heterogeneous distortion types. In the second stage, scores from multiple quality scorers are fused to achieve the best overall performance, where the fuser is designed based on the parallel boosting idea borrowed from machine learning. Extensive experimental results are conducted to compare the performance of the proposed PBSIQA system with those of existing stereo image quality assessment (SIQA) metrics. The developed quality metric can serve as an objective function to optimize the performance of a 3D content delivery system.

本文研究了立体图像质量评估在3D视觉内容传输中的应用问题，如3DTV。具体而言，我们提出了一种新的ParaBoost（并行增强）立体图像质量评估（PBSIQA）系统。该系统由两个阶段组成。在第一阶段，将各种失真分为几类，并针对特定失真类型开发个人质量得分者。这些记分员面对由异构失真类型组成的数据库提供了互补的性能。在第二阶段，融合了来自多个质量得分者的分数，以达到最佳的整体表现，其中融合器是基于借助于机器学习的平行提升思想而设计的。为了比较所提出的PBSIQA系统与现有的立体图像质量评估（SIQA）度量的性能，进行了广泛的实验结果。开发的质量度量可以作为优化3D内容传送系统的性能的目标函数。
