##### Abstract
We present Wasserstein introspective neural networks (WINN) that are both a generator and a discriminator within a single model. WINN provides a significant improvement over the recent introspective neural networks (INN) method by enhancing INN's generative modeling capability. WINN has three interesting properties: (1) A mathematical connection between the formulation of Wasserstein generative adversarial networks (WGAN) and the INN algorithm is made; (2) The explicit adoption of the Wasserstein distance into INN results in a large enhancement to INN, achieving compelling results even with a single classifier --- e.g., providing a 20 times reduction in model size over INN within texture modeling; (3) When applied to supervised classification, WINN also gives rise to greater robustness with an $88\%$ reduction of errors against adversarial examples --- improved over the result of $39\%$ by an INN-family algorithm. In the experiments, we report encouraging results on unsupervised learning problems including texture, face, and object modeling, as well as a supervised classification task against adversarial attack.

我们提出了Wasserstein内省神经网络（WINN），它是一个模型中的发生器和鉴别器。 WINN通过增强INN的生成建模能力，对最近的内省神经网络（INN）方法进行了重大改进。 WINN有三个有趣的性质：（1）建立了Wasserstein生成对抗网络（WGAN）和INN算法之间的数学关系; （2）在INN中明确采用Wasserstein距离导致INN的大幅增强，即使是单个分类器也能获得令人满意的结果 - 例如，在纹理建模中提供比INN模型大小缩减20倍的结果; （3）在应用于监督分类时，WINN也提高了鲁棒性，对抗对手的例子减少了88％的误差 - 通过INN家族算法改善了$ 39 \％$的结果。在实验中，我们报告了包括纹理，面部和对象建模在内的无监督学习问题的令人鼓舞的结果，以及针对敌意攻击的监督分类任务。
