##### Abstract
It is known that adverse environments such as high reverberation and low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) pose a great challenge to indoor sound source localization. To address this challenge, in this paper, we propose a sound source localization algorithm based on probabilistic neural network, namely Generalized cross correlation Classification Algorithm (GCA). Experimental results for adverse environments with high reverberation time T60 up to 600ms and low SNR such as -10dB show that, the average azimuth angle error and elevation angle error by GCA are only 4.6 degrees and 3.1 degrees respectively. Compared with three recently published algorithms, GCA has increased the success rate on direction of arrival estimation significantly with good robustness to environmental changes. These results show that the proposed GCA can localize accurately and robustly for diverse indoor applications where the site acoustic features can be studied prior to the localization stage.

众所周知，高混响，低信噪比（SNR）等恶劣环境对室内声源定位提出了很大的挑战。针对这一挑战，本文提出了一种基于概率神经网络的声源定位算法，即广义相关分类算法（GCA）。实验结果表明，混响时间T60高达600ms，信噪比低至-10dB的恶劣环境下，GCA的平均方位角误差和仰角误差分别为4.6度和3.1度。与最近发表的三种算法相比，GCA在提高到达方向估计的成功率方面具有很好的鲁棒性，这些结果表明，所提出的GCA可以准确而稳健地定位于不同的室内应用场合，在场地声学特征可以在本地化阶段之前进行研究。
