##### Abstract
Zero shot learning in image classification refers to the setting where images from some novel classes are absent in the training data. Images from the novel classes can still be correctly classified by taking cues from other modalities such as language. This setting is important in the real world since one cannot account for all the possible classes during training. We present a novel generative model for zero shot learning using conditional variational autoencoders. By extensive testing on four benchmark datasets, we show that our model can outperform the state of the art, particularly in the more realistic generalized setting where training classes can also appear at the test time along with novel classes.

图像分类中的零点学习是指在训练数据中不存在来自某些新类别的图像的设置。来自小说类的图像仍然可以通过从其他语言模式（如语言）中得到正确的分类。这个设置在现实世界中是非常重要的，因为在训练过程中不能考虑所有可能的类别。我们提出了一个新的生成模型零射击学习使用条件变分自动编码器。通过在四个基准数据集上的广泛测试，我们显示我们的模型可以超越现有技术水平，特别是在更实际的广义设置中，训练课程也可以在测试时间出现在新的课程中。
