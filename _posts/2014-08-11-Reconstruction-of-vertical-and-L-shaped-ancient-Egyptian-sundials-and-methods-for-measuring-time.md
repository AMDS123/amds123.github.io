##### Abstract
The article presents the results of the study of design features of vertical and L-shaped ancient Egyptian sundials. With the help of astronomical methods were developed their models, based on which the reconstruction of a sundial was held. Also, the original scheme is a simple way to fairly precise of measurement of time with them has been developed. Large urgency of the task due to the lack of similar models and schemes to date. Model offered by us, which describes the vertical sundial, is a vertical sundial, with a sloping gnomon, which takes into account latitude of area. It is based on the assumption of the existence in ancient Egypt representations about an hour (and a half hour) of equal duration throughout the day, does not depend on the time of year. Offered by us model is characterized by marking hour lines from 6 to 12 hours after each hour. From 12 to 12.5 hours produced displacement in the markup of hour lines on half an hour, then the markup is repeated every hour. As a consequence, the reconstruction of the vertical sundials, we have developed and proposed a model that describes the design features and operation of the L-shaped sundials of two types. They had to work together with the inclined gnomon, like vertical sundials or directly with vertical sundials. In this case, L-shaped sundials can complement vertical sundials, providing an opportunity to read the caption to hour markers and interpret the indications of vertical sundials because vertical sundials inscription missing. The article also describes explanation of the inscriptions from the tomb of Seti I, long intriguing researchers. It is proved that the inscription contains the length of the intervals between adjacent markers L-shaped sundial of the second type, where the first interval corresponds to a half of hour. Keywords: sundial, model, astronomical methods, archaeoastronomy, ancient Egypt.

文章介绍了垂直和L形埃及日design的设计特点的研究结果。在天文学方法的帮助下，开发了他们的模型，在此基础上重建了日was。另外，原来的方案是一个简单的方法，相当精确的测量时间与他们已经开发。由于迄今缺乏类似的模式和计划，这项任务的紧迫性很大。我们提供的描述垂直日Model的模型是一个垂直的日，，带有一个倾斜的g子，它考虑了面积的纬度。它是基于古埃及代表性存在的假设，一天一个小时（半小时），而不是一年中的时间。我们提供的模型的特点是在每小时之后的6到12小时内标记小时线。在12小时到12.5小时的时间段内，在半个小时的时间里产生了排量，然后每小时重复一次。因此，对垂直日reconstruction的重建，我们已经开发并提出了一个描述两种L形日design的设计特点和操作的模型。他们必须与倾斜的gnomon一起工作，如垂直的日or或直接与垂直的日ials。在这种情况下，L形的日can可以补充垂直的日，，提供一个机会阅读标题小时标记和解释垂直日indic的迹象，因为垂直的日ins铭文丢失。这篇文章还描述了塞蒂一世墓碑铭的解释，这些长期吸引人的研究人员。证明了题字包含了第二类相邻标记L形日intervals之间间隔的长度，其中第一个间隔对应于半小时。关键词：日su，模型，天文学方法，考古天文学，古埃及
