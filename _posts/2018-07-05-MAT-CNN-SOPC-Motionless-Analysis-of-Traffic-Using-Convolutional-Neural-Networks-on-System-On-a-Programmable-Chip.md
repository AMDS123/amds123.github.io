##### Abstract
Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) have become an important pillar in modern "smart city" framework which demands intelligent involvement of machines. Traffic load recognition can be categorized as an important and challenging issue for such systems. Recently, Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models have drawn considerable amount of interest in many areas such as weather classification, human rights violation detection through images, due to its accurate prediction capabilities. This work tackles real-life traffic load recognition problem on System-On-a-Programmable-Chip (SOPC) platform and coin it as MAT-CNN- SOPC, which uses an intelligent re-training mechanism of the CNN with known environments. The proposed methodology is capable of enhancing the efficacy of the approach by 2.44x in comparison to the state-of-art and proven through experimental analysis. We have also introduced a mathematical equation, which is capable of quantifying the suitability of using different CNN models over the other for a particular application based implementation.

智能交通系统（ITS）已经成为现代“智能城市”框架的重要支柱，需要机器的智能参与。对于这样的系统，流量负载识别可以被分类为重要且具有挑战性的问题。最近，由于其准确的预测能力，卷积神经网络（CNN）模型已经在许多领域引起了相当大的兴趣，例如天气分类，通过图像的人权违规检测。这项工作解决了可编程片上系统（SOPC）平台上的实际流量负载识别问题，并将其编入MAT-CNN-SOPC，它使用CNN的智能重新训练机制和已知环境。与现有技术相比，所提出的方法能够将该方法的效率提高2.44倍，并通过实验分析得到证实。我们还引入了一个数学方程，该方程能够量化使用不同CNN模型而不是基于特定应用的实现的适用性。
