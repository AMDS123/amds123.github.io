##### Abstract
Progress towards advanced systems for assisted and autonomous driving is leveraging recent advances in recognition and segmentation methods. Yet, we are still facing challenges in bringing reliable driving to inner cities, as those are composed of highly dynamic scenes observed from a moving platform at considerable speeds. Anticipation becomes a key element in order to react timely and prevent accidents. In this paper we argue that it is necessary to predict at least 1 second and we thus propose a new model that jointly predicts ego motion and people trajectories over such large time horizons. We pay particular attention to modeling the uncertainty of our estimates arising from the non-deterministic nature of natural traffic scenes. Our experimental results show that it is indeed possible to predict people trajectories at the desired time horizons and that our uncertainty estimates are informative of the prediction error. We also show that both sequence modeling of trajectories as well as our novel method of long term odometry prediction are essential for best performance.

先进的辅助和自动驾驶系统的发展正在利用识别和分割方法的最新进展。然而，我们仍然面临内心城市可靠驾驶方面的挑战，因为这些挑战是由以高速移动的平台观察到的高度活跃的场景组成的。预期成为及时反应和预防事故的关键因素。在本文中，我们认为有必要预测至少1秒，因此我们提出了一个新的模型，联合预测在这样大的时间范围内的自我运动和人的轨迹。我们特别关注对由自然交通场景的非确定性性质引起的估计的不确定性进行建模。我们的实验结果表明，确实有可能在预期的时间范围内预测人员轨迹，而且我们的不确定性估计是预测误差的信息。我们还表明，轨迹的序列建模以及我们的长期测距预测的新方法对于最佳性能是至关重要的。
