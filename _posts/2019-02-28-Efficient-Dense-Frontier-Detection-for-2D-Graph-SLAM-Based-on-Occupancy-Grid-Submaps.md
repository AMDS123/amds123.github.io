##### Abstract
In autonomous robot exploration, the frontier is the border in the world map between the explored space and unexplored space. The frontier plays an important role when deciding where in the environment the robots should go explore next. We examine a modular control system pipeline for autonomous exploration where a 2D graph SLAM algorithm based on occupancy grid submaps performs map building and localization. We provide an overview of the state of the art in frontier detection and the relevant SLAM concepts and propose a specialized frontier detection method which is efficiently constrained to active submaps, yet robust to SLAM loop closures.
