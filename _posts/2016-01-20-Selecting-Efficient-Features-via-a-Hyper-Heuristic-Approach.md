##### Abstract
By Emerging huge databases and the need to efficient learning algorithms on these datasets, new problems have appeared and some methods have been proposed to solve these problems by selecting efficient features. Feature selection is a problem of finding efficient features among all features in which the final feature set can improve accuracy and reduce complexity. One way to solve this problem is to evaluate all possible feature subsets. However, evaluating all possible feature subsets is an exhaustive search and thus it has high computational complexity. Until now many heuristic algorithms have been studied for solving this problem. Hyper-heuristic is a new heuristic approach which can search the solution space effectively by applying local searches appropriately. Each local search is a neighborhood searching algorithm. Since each region of the solution space can have its own characteristics, it should be chosen an appropriate local search and apply it to current solution. This task is tackled to a supervisor. The supervisor chooses a local search based on the functional history of local searches. By doing this task, it can trade of between exploitation and exploration. Since the existing heuristic cannot trade of between exploration and exploitation appropriately, the solution space has not been searched appropriately in these methods and thus they have low convergence rate. For the first time, in this paper use a hyper-heuristic approach to find an efficient feature subset. In the proposed method, genetic algorithm is used as a supervisor and 16 heuristic algorithms are used as local searches. Empirical study of the proposed method on several commonly used data sets from UCI data sets indicates that it outperforms recent existing methods in the literature for feature selection.

通过在这些数据集上出现大量数据库和对高效学习算法的需求，出现了新的问题，并提出了一些方法来选择有效的特征来解决这些问题。特征选择是在所有特征中找到有效特征的问题，其中最终特征集可以提高准确性并降低复杂性。解决这个问题的一种方法是评估所有可能的特征子集。然而，评估所有可能的特征子集是彻底的搜索，因此它具有很高的计算复杂度。到目前为止，已经研究了许多启发式算法来解决这个问题。超启发式是一种新的启发式方法，可以适当地应用本地搜索来有效搜索解空间。每个本地搜索都是一个邻域搜索算法。由于解空间的每个区域都可以有自己的特征，因此应该选择合适的局部搜索并将其应用于当前的解决方案。这个任务是向主管处理的。主管根据本地搜索的功能历史记录选择本地搜索。通过这个任务，可以在开采和勘探之间进行交易。由于现有的启发式算法不能适当地进行勘探与开发之间的交换，因此这些方法中解空间并没有得到适当的搜索，收敛速度较慢。本文首次使用超启发式方法来找到一个有效的特征子集。在所提出的方法中，遗传算法被用作监督者，并且使用16个启发式算法作为局部搜索。该方法对UCI数据集中常用数据集的实证研究表明，该方法优于文献中最近的特征选择方法。
