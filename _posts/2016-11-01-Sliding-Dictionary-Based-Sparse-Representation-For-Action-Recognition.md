##### Abstract
The task of action recognition has been in the forefront of research, given its applications in gaming, surveillance and health care. In this work, we propose a simple, yet very effective approach which works seamlessly for both offline and online action recognition using the skeletal joints. We construct a sliding dictionary which has the training data along with their time stamps. This is used to compute the sparse coefficients of the input action sequence which is divided into overlapping windows and each window gives a probability score for each action class. In addition, we compute another simple feature, which calibrates each of the action sequences to the training sequences, and models the deviation of the action from the each of the training data. Finally, a score level fusion of the two heterogeneous but complementary features for each window is obtained and the scores for the available windows are successively combined to give the confidence scores of each action class. This way of combining the scores makes the approach suitable for scenarios where only part of the sequence is available. Extensive experimental evaluation on three publicly available datasets shows the effectiveness of the proposed approach for both offline and online action recognition tasks.

由于其在游戏，监视和保健方面的应用，行动认可的任务一直处于研究的前沿。在这项工作中，我们提出了一个简单但非常有效的方法，可以无缝地使用骨骼关节进行离线和在线动作识别。我们构造一个带有训练数据和时间戳的滑动字典。这被用来计算被分成重叠窗口的输入动作序列的稀疏系数，并且每个窗口给出每个动作类别的概率分数。此外，我们计算另一个简单的特征，它将每个动作序列校准到训练序列，并且模拟动作与每个训练数据的偏差。最后，获得每个窗口的两个不同但互补的特征的分数级别融合，并且可用窗口的分数被连续地组合以给出每个动作类别的置信度分数。这种组合分数的方式使得该方法适合于只有部分序列可用的场景。对三个公开可用数据集的广泛的实验评估显示了所提出的用于离线和在线动作识别任务的方法的有效性。
