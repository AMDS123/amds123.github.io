##### Abstract
In our society and century, clothing is not anymore used only as a means for body protection. Our paper builds upon the evidence, studied within the social sciences, that clothing brings a clear communicative message in terms of social signals, influencing the impression and behaviour of others towards a person. In fact, clothing correlates with personality traits, both in terms of self-assessment and assessments that unacquainted people give to an individual. The consequences of these facts are important: the influence of clothing on the decision making of individuals has been investigated in the literature, showing that it represents a discriminative factor to differentiate among diverse groups of people. Unfortunately, this has been observed after cumbersome and expensive manual annotations, on very restricted populations, limiting the scope of the resulting claims. With this position paper, we want to sketch the main steps of the very first systematic analysis, driven by social signal processing techniques, of the relationship between clothing and social signals, both sent and perceived. Thanks to human parsing technologies, which exhibit high robustness owing to deep learning architectures, we are now capable to isolate visual patterns characterising a large types of garments. These algorithms will be used to capture statistical relations on a large corpus of evidence to confirm the sociological findings and to go beyond the state of the art.

##### Abstract (translated by Google)
在我们的社会和世纪，服装不再被用作保护身体的手段。我们的论文建立在社会科学研究的证据基础之上，即服装在社会信号方面带来了清晰的交流信息，影响了他人对人的印象和行为。事实上，服装与人格特质相关，无论是自我评估还是不熟悉的人给予个人的评估。这些事实的后果是重要的：服装对个人决策的影响已经在文献中进行了调查，表明它是区分不同人群的区别因素。不幸的是，在繁琐而昂贵的手工注释之后，在非常有限的人群中观察到这种情况，限制了所得到的权利要求的范围。通过这篇立场文件，我们想要描绘在社交信号处理技术的驱动下，第一个系统分析服装和社会信号之间关系的主要步骤。由于深度学习架构使得人类解析技术具有很高的鲁棒性，因此我们现在能够将大型服装的视觉模式分离出来。这些算法将被用于捕获大量证据的统计关系，以确认社会学的发现并超越现有技术水平。
