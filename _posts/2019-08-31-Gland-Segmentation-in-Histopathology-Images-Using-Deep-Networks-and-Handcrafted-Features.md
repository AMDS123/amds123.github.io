##### Abstract
Histopathology images contain essential information for medical diagnosis and prognosis of cancerous disease. Segmentation of glands in histopathology images is a primary step for analysis and diagnosis of an unhealthy patient. Due to the widespread application and the great success of deep neural networks in intelligent medical diagnosis and histopathology, we propose a modified version of LinkNet for gland segmentation and recognition of malignant cases. We show that using specific handcrafted features such as invariant local binary pattern drastically improves the system performance. The experimental results demonstrate the competency of the proposed system against state-of-the-art methods. We achieved the best results in testing on section B images of the Warwick-QU dataset and obtained comparable results on section A images.
