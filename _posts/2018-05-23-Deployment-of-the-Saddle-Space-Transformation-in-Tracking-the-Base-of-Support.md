##### Abstract
Balance is the fundamental skill behind human locomotion, and its impairment is the principal indicator of self-perceived disability. Despite significant improvements in balance assessment, there is still large incidence of fall related injuries among elderlies. The Base of Support (BoS) is a popular method for bipedal stability assessment, but its accuracy depends on the accuracy the BoS geometry measurement. This work presents a method to ease the BoS tracking by the identification of a reference frame that allows to define postural models of the BoS geometry. Although we also propose a geometry based on the geometry determined from centre of pressure range of motion within the foot obtained from literature, this methodology can be used with other models (i.e., the feasible base of support). The model has been tested with 12 healthy subjects, which have been asked to explore their stability in six different postures. The results show that the model can accurate deform the geometry of the BoS to adapt its shape to the different postures, which is can remove the necessity of force/torque sensors in some application. Potentially the proposed method can be also applied to describe any posture dependent attribute (e.g., gravitational forces), and it can be also applied to bipedal robots. Therefore, it constitutes a novel mathematical tool that can be deployed to develop both better sensors and models for bipeds. For example, it can be used with the Extrapolated CoM model to evaluate dynamic stability from the body kinematics.

平衡是人类运动背后的基本技能，其损伤是自我认知残疾的主要指标。尽管平衡评估有了显着改善，但老年人跌倒相关损伤的发生率仍然很高。支持基础（BoS）是一种非常流行的双足稳定性评估方法，但其准确性取决于BoS几何测量的准确性。这项工作提出了一种方法，通过识别允许定义BoS几何体姿态模型的参考框架来简化BoS跟踪。尽管我们也提出了基于从文献中获得的脚内运动的压力范围的中心确定的几何形状的几何，但该方法可以与其他模型（即可行的支撑基）一起使用。该模型已经与12名健康受试者进行了测试，这些受试者被要求以六种不同的姿势探索其稳定性。结果表明，该模型能准确地变形BoS的几何形状，使其形状适应不同的姿态，这可以在某些应用中消除力/力矩传感器的必要性。所提出的方法可能也可以用于描述任何与姿势有关的属性（例如重力），并且它也可以应用于双足机器人。因此，它构成了一种新颖的数学工具，可用于开发更好的传感器和两足动物模型。例如，它可以与外推CoM模型一起使用，以评估身体运动学的动态稳定性。
