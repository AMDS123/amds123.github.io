##### Abstract
Many recommender systems suffer from the popularity bias problem: popular items are being recommended frequently while less popular, niche products, are recommended rarely if not at all. However, those ignored products are exactly the products that businesses need to find customers for and their recommendations would be more beneficial. In this paper, we examine an item weighting approach to improve long-tail recommendation. Our approach works as a simple yet powerful add-on to existing recommendation algorithms for making a tunable trade-off between accuracy and long-tail coverage.

许多推荐系统都受到流行偏见问题的困扰：流行项目被频繁推荐，而不太受欢迎的小众产品则很少推荐，如果根本不推荐的话。然而，那些被忽略的产品恰恰是企业需要寻找客户的产品，他们的建议会更有益。在本文中，我们考察一个项目加权方法来改善长尾推荐。我们的方法可作为现有推荐算法的简单而强大的附加功能，用于在准确性和长尾覆盖率之间做出可调整的折衷。
