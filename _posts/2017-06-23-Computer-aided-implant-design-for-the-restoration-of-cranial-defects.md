##### Abstract
Patient-specific cranial implants are important and necessary in the surgery of cranial defect restoration. However, traditional methods of manual design of cranial implants are complicated and time-consuming. Our purpose is to develop a novel software named EasyCrania to design the cranial implants conveniently and efficiently. The process can be divided into five steps, which are mirroring model, clipping surface, surface fitting, the generation of the initial implant and the generation of the final implant. The main concept of our method is to use the geometry information of the mirrored model as the base to generate the final implant. The comparative studies demonstrated that the EasyCrania can improve the efficiency of cranial implant design significantly. And, the intra- and inter-rater reliability of the software were stable, which were 87.07+/-1.6% and 87.73+/-1.4% respectively.

患者特异性头盖种植体在颅骨缺损修复手术中是重要和必要的。然而，传统的颅骨植入手工设计方法复杂且耗时。我们的目的是开发一种名为EasyCrania的新型软件，以方便和高效地设计颅骨植入物。该过程可分为镜像模型，剪切面，曲面拟合，初始植入物的生成以及最终植入物的生成五个步骤。我们的方法的主要概念是使用镜像模型的几何信息作为基础来生成最终的注入。比较研究表明，EasyCrania可显着提高头颅植入设计的效率。而且，软件内部和部分间的可靠性是稳定的，分别为87.07 +/- 1.6％和87.73 +/- 1.4％。
