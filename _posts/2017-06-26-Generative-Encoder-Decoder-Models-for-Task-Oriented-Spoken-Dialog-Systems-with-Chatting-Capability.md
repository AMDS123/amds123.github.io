##### Abstract
Generative encoder-decoder models offer great promise in developing domain-general dialog systems. However, they have mainly been applied to open-domain conversations. This paper presents a practical and novel framework for building task-oriented dialog systems based on encoder-decoder models. This framework enables encoder-decoder models to accomplish slot-value independent decision-making and interact with external databases. Moreover, this paper shows the flexibility of the proposed method by interleaving chatting capability with a slot-filling system for better out-of-domain recovery. The models were trained on both real-user data from a bus information system and human-human chat data. Results show that the proposed framework achieves good performance in both offline evaluation metrics and in task success rate with human users.

生成编码器 - 解码器模型在开发域 - 对话系统中提供了很大的希望。但是，它们主要应用于开放域的对话。本文提出了一个基于编码器 - 解码器模型的面向任务的对话系统的实用和新颖的框架。该框架使得编码器 - 解码器模型能够实现与时隙值无关的决策并与外部数据库进行交互。此外，本文通过将交谈能力与时隙填充系统交织以实现更好的域外恢复来显示所提出的方法的灵活性。模型接受了来自公交信息系统的实际用户数据和人类聊天数据的训练。结果表明，所提出的框架在离线评估指标和人类用户任务成功率方面都取得了良好的效果。
