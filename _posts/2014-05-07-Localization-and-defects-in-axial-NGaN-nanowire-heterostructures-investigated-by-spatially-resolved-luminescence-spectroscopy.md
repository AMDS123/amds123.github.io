##### Abstract
(In,Ga)N insertions embedded in self-assembled GaN nanowires are of current interest for applications in solid state light emitters. Such structures exhibit a notoriously broad emission band. We use cathodoluminescence spectral imaging in a scanning electron microscope and micro-photoluminescence spectroscopy on single nanowires to learn more about the mechanisms underlying this emission. We observe a shift of the emission energy along the stack of six insertions within single nanowires that may be explained by compositional pulling. Our results also corroborate reports that the localization of carriers at potential fluctuations within the insertions plays a crucial role for the luminescence of these nanowire based emitters. Furthermore, we resolve contributions from both structural and point defects in our measurements.
