##### Abstract
Saliency detection has drawn a lot of attention of researchers in various fields over the past several years. Saliency is the perceptual quality that makes an object, person to draw the attention of humans at the very sight. Salient object detection in an image has been used centrally in many computational photography and computer vision applications like video compression, object recognition and classification, object segmentation, adaptive content delivery, motion detection, content aware resizing, camouflage images and change blindness images to name a few. We propose a method to detect saliency in the objects using multimodal dictionary learning which has been recently used in classification and image fusion. The multimodal dictionary that we are learning is task driven which gives improved performance over its counterpart (the one which is not task specific).

显着性检测在过去几年引起了各方面研究人员的广泛关注。显着性是使物体，人在视觉上引起人的注意的感性质量。图像中的显着物体检测已经集中用于许多计算摄影和计算机视觉应用，例如视频压缩，物体识别和分类，物体分割，自适应内容传送，运动检测，内容感知大小调整，伪装图像和改变失明图像以命名为少数。我们提出了一种使用多模态字典学习来检测对象中的显着性的方法，该方法最近已经用于分类和图像融合。我们正在学习的多模态字典是任务驱动的，与其对应的（不是任务特定的）相比，性能有所提高。
