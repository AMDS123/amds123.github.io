##### Abstract
Benefiting from its succinctness and robustness, skeleton-based action recognition has recently attracted much attention. Most existing methods utilize local networks (e.g., recurrent, convolutional, and graph convolutional networks) to extract spatio-temporal dynamics hierarchically. As a consequence, the local and non-local dependencies, which contain more details and semantics respectively, are asynchronously captured in different level of layers. Moreover, existing methods are limited to the spatio-temporal domain and ignore information in the frequency domain. To better extract synchronous detailed and semantic information from multi-domains, we propose a residual frequency attention (rFA) block to focus on discriminative patterns in the frequency domain, and a synchronous local and non-local (SLnL) block to simultaneously capture the details and semantics in the spatio-temporal domain. Besides, a soft-margin focal loss (SMFL) is proposed to optimize the learning whole process, which automatically conducts data selection and encourages intrinsic margins in classifiers. Our approach significantly outperforms other state-of-the-art methods on several large-scale datasets.
