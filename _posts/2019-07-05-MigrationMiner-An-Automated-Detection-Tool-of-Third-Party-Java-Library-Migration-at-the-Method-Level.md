##### Abstract
In this paper we introduce, MigrationMiner, an automated tool that detects code migrations performed between Java third-party library. Given a list of open source projects, the tool detects potential library migration code changes and collects the specific code fragments in which the developer replaces methods from the retired library with methods from the new library. To support the migration process, MigrationMiner collects the library documentation that is associated with every method involved in the migration. We evaluate our tool on a benchmark of manually validated library migrations. Results show that MigrationMiner achieves an accuracy of 100%. A demo video of MigrationMiner is available at https://youtu.be/sAlR1HNetXc.
