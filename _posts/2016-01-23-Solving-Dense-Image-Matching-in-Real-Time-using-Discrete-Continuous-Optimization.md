##### Abstract
Dense image matching is a fundamental low-level problem in Computer Vision, which has received tremendous attention from both discrete and continuous optimization communities. The goal of this paper is to combine the advantages of discrete and continuous optimization in a coherent framework. We devise a model based on energy minimization, to be optimized by both discrete and continuous algorithms in a consistent way. In the discrete setting, we propose a novel optimization algorithm that can be massively parallelized. In the continuous setting we tackle the problem of non-convex regularizers by a formulation based on differences of convex functions. The resulting hybrid discrete-continuous algorithm can be efficiently accelerated by modern GPUs and we demonstrate its real-time performance for the applications of dense stereo matching and optical flow.

密集的图像匹配是计算机视觉中的一个基本的低层次问题，受到离散和连续优化社区的广泛关注。本文的目标是在一个连贯的框架中结合离散和连续优化的优势。我们设计一个基于能量最小化的模型，以一致的方式通过离散和连续算法进行优化。在离散情况下，我们提出了一种可以大规模并行化的新型优化算法。在连续设置中，我们通过基于凸函数的差异的公式来解决非凸正则化器的问题。由此产生的混合离散连续算法可以被现代GPU有效地加速，并且我们证明了它在密集立体匹配和光流应用中的实时性能。
