##### Abstract
We investigate the effect and usefulness of spontaneity in speech (i.e. whether a given speech data is spontaneous or not) in the context of emotion recognition. We hypothesize that emotional content in speech is interrelated with its spontaneity, and thus propose to use spontaneity classification as an auxiliary task to the problem of emotion recognition. We propose two supervised learning settings that utilize spontaneity to improve speech emotion recognition: a hierarchical model that performs spontaneity detection before performing emotion recognition, and a multitask learning model that jointly learns to recognize both spontaneity and emotion. Through various experiments on a benchmark database, we show that by using spontaneity as an additional information, significant improvement (3%) can be achieved over systems that are unaware of spontaneity. We also observe that spontaneity information is highly useful in recognizing positive emotions as the recognition accuracy improves by 12%.

我们在情绪识别的背景下调查自发性在言语中的作用和有用性（即给定的言语数据是否是自发性的）。我们假设言语中的情绪内容与其自发性是相关的，因此建议使用自发性分类作为情绪识别问题的辅助任务。我们提出了两种利用自发性来改善语音情感识别的监督学习设置：在执行情绪识别之前执行自发性检测的分层模型以及共同学习识别自发性和情绪的多任务学习模型。通过对基准数据库进行的各种实验，我们发现，通过使用自发性作为附加信息，可以在不了解自发性的系统上实现显着的提高（3％）。我们还观察到自发性信息在识别正面情绪方面非常有用，因为识别准确性提高了12％。
