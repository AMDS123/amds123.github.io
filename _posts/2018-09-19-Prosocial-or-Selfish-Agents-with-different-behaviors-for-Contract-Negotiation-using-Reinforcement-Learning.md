##### Abstract
We present an effective technique for training deep learning agents capable of negotiating on a set of clauses in a contract agreement using a simple communication protocol. We use Multi Agent Reinforcement Learning to train both agents simultaneously as they negotiate with each other in the training environment. We also model selfish and prosocial behavior to varying degrees in these agents. Empirical evidence is provided showing consistency in agent behaviors. We further train a meta agent with a mixture of behaviors by learning an ensemble of different models using reinforcement learning. Finally, to ascertain the deployability of the negotiating agents, we conducted experiments pitting the trained agents against human players. Results demonstrate that the agents are able to hold their own against human players, often emerging as winners in the negotiation. Our experiments demonstrate that the meta agent is able to reasonably emulate human behavior.

我们提出了一种有效的技术，用于培训能够使用简单的通信协议就合同协议中的一组条款进行谈判的深度学习代理。我们使用多智能体强化学习来同时训练两个代理，因为它们在训练环境中相互协商。我们还在不同程度上模拟了这些代理人的自私和亲社会行为。提供的经验证据表明代理行为的一致性。我们通过使用强化学习来学习不同模型的集合，进一步训练具有混合行为的元代理。最后，为了确定谈判代理人的可部署性，我们进行了实验，让训练有素的代理人对抗人类参与者。结果表明，代理人能够对抗人类玩家，通常在谈判中成为赢家。我们的实验表明，元代理能够合理地模拟人类行为。
