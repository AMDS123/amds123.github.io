##### Abstract
Multiplayer Online Battle Arena (MOBA) games have received increasing worldwide popularity recently. In such games, players compete in teams against each other by controlling selected game avatars, each of which is designed with different strengths and weaknesses. Intuitively, putting together game avatars that complement each other (synergy) and suppress those of opponents (opposition) would result in a stronger team. In-depth understanding of synergy and opposition relationships among game avatars benefits player in making decisions in game avatar drafting and gaining better prediction of match events. However, due to intricate design and complex interactions between game avatars, thorough understanding of their relationships is not a trivial task. 
 In this paper, we propose a latent variable model, namely Game Avatar Embedding (GAE), to learn avatars' numerical representations which encode synergy and opposition relationships between pairs of avatars. The merits of our model are twofold: (1) the captured synergy and opposition relationships are sensible to experienced human players' perception; (2) the learned numerical representations of game avatars allow many important downstream tasks, such as similar avatar search, match outcome prediction, and avatar pick recommender. To our best knowledge, no previous model is able to simultaneously support both features. Our quantitative and qualitative evaluations on real match data from three commercial MOBA games illustrate the benefits of our model.

多人在线战斗竞技场（MOBA）游戏最近在全球范围内受到越来越多的欢迎。在这样的游戏中，玩家通过控制选定的游戏头像来彼此竞争，每个游戏头像都被设计成具有不同的长处和短处。直观地说，将相互补充（协同作用）的游戏角色集合在一起并压制对手（反对者）将会产生更强大的团队。深入了解游戏头像之间的协同和对立关系有助于玩家在游戏头像制作中做出决定并获得对比赛事件的更好预测。但是，由于游戏头像之间错综复杂的设计和复杂的相互作用，深入了解他们之间的关系并非轻而易举的事情。
 在本文中，我们提出了一个潜在变量模型，即游戏头像嵌入（GAE），以了解编码对之间的协同作用和对立关系的化身数字表示。我们模型的优点是双重的：（1）被捕获的协同作用和对立关系对经验丰富的人类玩家的感知是明智的; （2）游戏头像的学习数字表示允许许多重要的下游任务，诸如类似的头像搜索，匹配结果预测和头像挑选推荐者。据我们所知，没有以前的模型能够同时支持这两个功能。我们对来自三个商业MOBA游戏的实际匹配数据的定量和定性评估说明了我们模型的好处。
