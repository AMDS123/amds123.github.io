##### Abstract
New micro-satellite constellations enable unprecedented systematic monitoring applications thanks to their wide coverage and short revisit capabilities. However, the large volumes of images that they produce have uneven qualities, creating the need for automatic quality assessment methods. In this work, we quantify the sharpness of images from the PlanetScope constellation by estimating the blur kernel from each image. Once the kernel has been estimated, it is possible to compute an absolute measure of sharpness which allows to discard low quality images and deconvolve blurry images before any further processing. The method is fully blind and automatic, and since it does not require the knowledge of any satellite specifications it can be ported to other constellations.
