##### Abstract
This paper proposes a novel luminance adjustment method based on automatic exposure compensation for multi-exposure image fusion. Multi-exposure image fusion is a method to produce images without saturation regions, by using photos with different exposures. In conventional works, it has been pointed out that the quality of those multi-exposure images can be improved by adjusting the luminance of them. However, how to determine the degree of adjustment has never been discussed. This paper therefore proposes a way to automatically determines the degree on the basis of the luminance distribution of input multi-exposure images. Moreover, new weights, called "simple weights", for image fusion are also considered for the proposed luminance adjustment method. Experimental results show that the multi-exposure images adjusted by the proposed method have better quality than the input multi-exposure ones in terms of the well-exposedness. It is also confirmed that the proposed simple weights provide the highest score of statistical naturalness and discrete entropy in all fusion methods.

本文提出了一种基于自动曝光补偿的多曝光图像融合的新颖亮度调整方法。多曝光图像融合是通过使用不同曝光的照片来产生没有饱和区域的图像的方法。在传统的作品中，已经指出通过调整它们的亮度可以改善这些多重曝光图像的质量。但是，如何确定调整的程度从来没有讨论过。因此，本文提出了一种基于输入多重曝光图像的亮度分布来自动确定程度的方法。此外，所提出的亮度调整方法也考虑用于图像融合的称为“简单权重”的新权重。实验结果表明，所提出的方法调整后的多重曝光图像在曝光良好方面比输入多重曝光图像具有更好的质量。还证实了所提出的简单权重在所有融合方法中提供统计自然度和离散熵的最高得分。
