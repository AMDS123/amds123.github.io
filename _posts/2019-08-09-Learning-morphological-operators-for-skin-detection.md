##### Abstract
In this work we propose a novel post processing approach for skin detectors based on trained morphological operators. The first step, consisting in skin segmentation is performed according to an existing skin detection approach is performed for skin segmentation, then a second step is carried out consisting in the application of a set of morphological operators to refine the resulting mask. Extensive experimental evaluation performed considering two different detection approaches (one based on deep learning and a handcrafted one) carried on 10 different datasets confirms the quality of the proposed method.
