##### Abstract
We propose an approach to the problem of global reconstruction of an orientation field. The method is based on a geometric model called "bisector line fields", which maps a pair of vector fields to an orientation field, effectively generalizing the notion of doubling phase vector fields. Endowed with a well chosen energy minimization problem, we provide a polynomial interpolation of a target orientation field while bypassing the doubling phase step. The procedure is then illustrated with examples from fingerprint analysis.
