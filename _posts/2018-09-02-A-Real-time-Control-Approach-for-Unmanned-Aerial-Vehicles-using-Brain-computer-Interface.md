##### Abstract
Brain-computer interfacing (BCI) is a technology that is almost four decades old and it was developed solely for the purpose of developing and enhancing the impact of neuroprosthetics. However, in the recent times, with the commercialization of non-invasive electroencephalogram (EEG) headsets, the technology has seen a wide variety of applications like home automation, wheelchair control, vehicle steering etc. One of the latest developed applications is the mind-controlled quadrotor unmanned aerial vehicle. These applications, how- ever, do not require a very high-speed response and give satisfactory results when standard classification methods like Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLPC). Issues are faced when there is a requirement for high-speed control in the case of fixed-wing unmanned aerial vehicles where such methods are rendered unreliable due to the low speed of classification. Such an application requires the system to classify data at high speeds in order to retain the con- trollability of the vehicle. This paper proposes a novel method of classification which uses a combination of Common Spatial Paradigm and Linear Discriminant Analysis that provides an improved classification accuracy in real time. A non-linear SVM based classification technique has also been discussed. Further, this paper discusses the implementation of the proposed method on a fixed-wing and VTOL unmanned aerial vehicles.

##### Abstract (translated by Google)
脑 - 计算机接口（BCI）是一项已有近四十年历史的技术，它的开发仅仅是为了开发和增强神经修复术的影响。然而，近年来，随着非侵入性脑电图（EEG）耳机的商业化，该技术已经出现了各种各样的应用，如家庭自动化，轮椅控制，车辆转向等。最新开发的应用之一是心灵 - 受控四旋翼无人机。然而，这些应用程序不需要非常高速的响应，并且在支持向量机（SVM）和多层感知器（MLPC）等标准分类方法时会产生令人满意的结果。当固定翼无人驾驶飞行器需要高速控制时，由于分类速度低，这些方法变得不可靠，因此面临着一些问题。这种应用要求系统高速分类数据，以保持车辆的可控性。本文提出了一种新的分类方法，它结合了共同空间范式和线性判别分析，可以实时提高分类精度。还讨论了基于非线性SVM的分类技术。此外，本文还讨论了该方法在固定翼和垂直起降无人机上的实施。
