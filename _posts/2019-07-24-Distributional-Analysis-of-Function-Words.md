##### Abstract
This paper is a first attempt at reconciling the current methods of distributional semantics with the function word emphasis of formal linguistics. We consider a multiply polysemous function word, the German reflexive pronoun "sich", and investigate in which ways natural subclasses of this word known from the theoretical and typological literature map onto recent models from distributional semantics.
