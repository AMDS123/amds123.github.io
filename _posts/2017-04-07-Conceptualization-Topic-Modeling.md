##### Abstract
Recently, topic modeling has been widely used to discover the abstract topics in text corpora. Most of the existing topic models are based on the assumption of three-layer hierarchical Bayesian structure, i.e. each document is modeled as a probability distribution over topics, and each topic is a probability distribution over words. However, the assumption is not optimal. Intuitively, it's more reasonable to assume that each topic is a probability distribution over concepts, and then each concept is a probability distribution over words, i.e. adding a latent concept layer between topic layer and word layer in traditional three-layer assumption. In this paper, we verify the proposed assumption by incorporating the new assumption in two representative topic models, and obtain two novel topic models. Extensive experiments were conducted among the proposed models and corresponding baselines, and the results show that the proposed models significantly outperform the baselines in terms of case study and perplexity, which means the new assumption is more reasonable than traditional one.

##### Abstract (translated by Google)
最近，主题建模已被广泛用于发现文本语料库中的抽象主题。现有的大多数主题模型都是基于三层分层贝叶斯结构的假设，即每个文档被建模为主题的概率分布，每个主题是一个概率分布的单词。但是，这个假设并不是最优的。直观地说，假定每个主题是概念上的概率分布是更合理的，那么每个概念就是概率分布，即在传统的三层假设中，在主题层和词层之间增加一个潜在的概念层。在本文中，我们通过在两个有代表性的话题模型中加入新的假设来验证所提出的假设，并获得两个新的话题模型。在所提出的模型和相应的基线之间进行了广泛的实验，结果表明，所提出的模型在案例研究和困惑方面明显优于基线，这意味着新的假设比传统的假设更合理。
