##### Abstract
This paper introduces a new surgical end-effector probe, which allows to accurately apply a contact force on a tissue, while at the same time allowing for high resolution and highly repeatable probe movement. These are achieved by implementing a cable-driven parallel manipulator arrangement, which is deployed at the distal-end of a robotic instrument. The combination of the offered qualities can be advantageous in several ways, with possible applications including: large area endomicroscopy and multi-spectral imaging, micro-surgery, tissue palpation, safe energy-based and conventional tissue resection. To demonstrate the concept and its adaptability, the probe is integrated with a modified da Vinci robot instrument.

本文介绍了一种新的手术末端执行器探针，它可以准确地在组织上施加接触力，同时允许高分辨率和高度可重复的探针移动。这些通过实现在机器人仪器的远端部署的电缆驱动的并联机械手装置来实现。所提供的品质的组合在多个方面可以是有利的，可能的应用包括：大面积内显微镜和多光谱成像，显微手术，组织触诊，安全的基于能量的和常规组织切除。为了演示这个概念及其适应性，探头与一个改进的达芬奇机器人仪器集成在一起。
