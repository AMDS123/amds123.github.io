##### Abstract
Recent successes in machine learning have led to a shift in the design of autonomous systems, improving performance on existing tasks and rendering new applications possible. Data-focused approaches gain relevance across diverse, intricate applications when developing data collection and curation pipelines becomes more effective than manual behaviour design. The following work aims at increasing the efficiency of this pipeline in two principal ways: by utilising more powerful sources of informative data and by extracting additional information from existing data. In particular, we target three orthogonal fronts: imitation learning, domain adaptation, and transfer from simulation.
