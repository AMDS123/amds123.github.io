##### Abstract
This essay examines how what is considered to be artificial intelligence (AI) has changed over time and come to intersect with the expertise of the author. Initially, AI developed on a separate trajectory, both topically and institutionally, from pattern recognition, neural information processing, decision and control systems, and allied topics by focusing on symbolic systems within computer science departments rather than on continuous systems in electrical engineering departments. The separate evolutions continued throughout the author's lifetime, with some crossover in reinforcement learning and graphical models, but were shocked into converging by the virality of deep learning, thus making an electrical engineer into an AI researcher. Now that this convergence has happened, opportunity exists to pursue an agenda that combines learning and reasoning bridged by interpretable machine learning models.

##### Abstract (translated by Google)
本文探讨了人工智能（AI）如何随着时间的推移而发生变化，并与作者的专长相交叉。最初，AI通过模式识别，神经信息处理，决策和控制系统以及相关主题在单独的轨迹上进行了局部和系统的研究，重点放在计算机科学系的符号系统上，而不是电气工程系的连续系统中。在整个作者的整个生命周期中，这些独立的演变一直持续下去，在强化学习和图形模型方面有一些交叉，但被深度学习的病毒式传播所震撼，从而使电气工程师成为AI研究人员。既然已经发生了这种融合，那么就有机会追求一个将可理解的机器学习模型桥接起来的学习与推理相结合的议程。
