##### Abstract
Pairwise comparison matrices often exhibit inconsistency, therefore, a number of indices has been introduced to measure their deviation from a consistent matrix. Since inconsistency first emerges in the case of three alternatives, several inconsistency indices are based on triads. Recently, a set of axioms has been proposed, and is required to be satisfied by any reasonable inconsistency index. We illustrate by an example that this set seems to be not exhaustive, hence expand it by adding two new properties. We consider all axioms on the set of triads, and choose the logically independent ones. Finally, it is proved that they characterize the inconsistency ranking induced by the Koczkodaj inconsistency index on this domain.

##### Abstract (translated by Google)
成对比较矩阵经常表现出不一致性，因此引入了许多指标来衡量它们与一致矩阵的偏差。由于在三种选择方案中首先出现不一致，因此有几个不一致指数是基于黑社会的。近来，已经提出了一套公理，需要用任何合理的不一致性指标来满足。我们通过一个例子来说明这个集合似乎并不完全，因此通过增加两个新的属性来扩展它。我们考虑所有黑社会的公理，选择逻辑上独立的公理。最后，证明了该域上由Koczkodaj不一致性指标引起的不一致性排序。
