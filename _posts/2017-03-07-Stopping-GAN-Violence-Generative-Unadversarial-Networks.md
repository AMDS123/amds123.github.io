##### Abstract
While the costs of human violence have attracted a great deal of attention from the research community, the effects of the network-on-network (NoN) violence popularised by Generative Adversarial Networks have yet to be addressed. In this work, we quantify the financial, social, spiritual, cultural, grammatical and dermatological impact of this aggression and address the issue by proposing a more peaceful approach which we term Generative Unadversarial Networks (GUNs). Under this framework, we simultaneously train two models: a generator G that does its best to capture whichever data distribution it feels it can manage, and a motivator M that helps G to achieve its dream. Fighting is strictly verboten and both models evolve by learning to respect their differences. The framework is both theoretically and electrically grounded in game theory, and can be viewed as a winner-shares-all two-player game in which both players work as a team to achieve the best score. Experiments show that by working in harmony, the proposed model is able to claim both the moral and log-likelihood high ground. Our work builds on a rich history of carefully argued position-papers, published as anonymous YouTube comments, which prove that the optimal solution to NoN violence is more GUNs.

虽然人类暴力成本引起了研究界的高度关注，但是生成敌对网络所普及的网络对抗（NoN）暴力的影响尚未得到解决。在这项工作中，我们量化了这次侵略的金融，社会，精神，文化，语法和皮肤病的影响，并提出了一个更为和平的方法，我们称之为生成非调制网络（GUNs）。在这个框架下，我们同时训练两个模型：一个生成器G，尽力捕捉它感觉可以管理的数据分布，一个激励器M，帮助G实现其梦想。战斗是严格禁止的，两种模式都是通过学习尊重他们的差异而演变的。这个框架在理论和电子理论上都是博弈论的基础，可以被看作是一个赢家 - 股份 - 所有双人游戏，在这两个游戏中，两个玩家都以一个团队的身份来实现最好的成绩。实验表明，通过协调工作，所提出的模型能够同时宣称道德和对数似然的制高点。我们的工作建立在丰富的认真讨论的立场文件的历史上，作为匿名的YouTube评论发布，证明NoN暴力的最佳解决方案是更多的GUN。
