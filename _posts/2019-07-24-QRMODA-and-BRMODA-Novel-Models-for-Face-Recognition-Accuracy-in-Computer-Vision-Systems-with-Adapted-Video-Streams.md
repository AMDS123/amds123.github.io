##### Abstract
A major challenge facing Computer Vision systems is providing the ability to accurately detect threats and recognize subjects and/or objects under dynamically changing network conditions. We propose two novel models that characterize the face recognition accuracy in terms of video encoding parameters. Specifically, we model the accuracy in terms of video resolution, quantization, and actual bit rate. We validate the models using two distinct video datasets and a large image dataset by conducting 1, 668 experiments that involve simultaneously varying combinations of encoding parameters. We show that both models hold true for the deep learning and statistical based face recognition. Furthermore, we show that the models can be used to capture different accuracy metrics, specifically the recall, precision, and F1-score. Ultimately, we provide meaningful insights on the factors affecting the constants of each proposed model.
