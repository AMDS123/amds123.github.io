##### Abstract
Artificial neural networks have seen a recent surge in popularity for their ability to solve complex problems as well as or better than humans. In computer vision, deep convolutional neural networks have become the standard for object classification and image understanding due to their ability to learn efficient representations of high-dimensional data. However, the relationship between these representations and human psychological representations has remained unclear. Here we evaluate the quantitative and qualitative nature of this correspondence. We find that state-of-the-art object classification networks provide a reasonable first approximation to human similarity judgments, but fail to capture some of the structure of psychological representations. We show that a simple transformation that corrects these discrepancies can be obtained through convex optimization. Such representations provide a tool that can be used to study human performance on complex tasks with naturalistic stimuli, such as predicting the difficulty of learning novel categories. Our results extend the scope of psychological experiments and computational modeling of cognition by enabling tractable use of large natural stimulus sets.

近年来人造神经网络在解决复杂问题的能力方面已经出现了大幅度的增长，并且甚至比人类还要好。在计算机视觉中，由于深度卷积神经网络能够学习高维数据的高效表示，因此已经成为对象分类和图像理解的标准。然而，这些表征与人类心理表征之间的关系仍然不清楚。在这里我们评估这个通信的定量和定性的性质。我们发现，最先进的目标分类网络提供了一个合理的初步近似人类相似性判断，但没有捕捉到一些心理表征的结构。我们表明，一个简单的转换，纠正这些差异可以通过凸优化获得。这样的表示提供了一个工具，可以用来研究自然主义刺激的复杂任务的人类表现，如预测学习新类别的难度。我们的结果扩大了心理实验的范围和认识的计算模型，使大型自然刺激集合易于使用。
