##### Abstract
Artificial intelligence is making great changes in academy and industry with the fast development of deep learning, which is a branch of machine learning and statistical learning. Fully convolutional network [1] is the standard model for semantic segmentation. Conditional random fields coded as CNN [2] or RNN [3] and connected with FCN has been successfully applied in object detection [4]. In this paper, we introduce a multi-resolution neural network for FCN and apply Gaussian filter to the extended CRF kernel neighborhood and the label image to reduce the oscillating effect of CRF neural network segmentation, thus achieve higher precision and faster training speed.

随着深度学习的快速发展，人工智能正在发生巨大的变化，是机器学习和统计学习的一个分支。完全卷积网络[1]是语义分割的标准模型。编码为CNN [2]或RNN [3]并与FCN连接的条件随机场已成功应用于对象检测[4]。在本文中，我们引入了FCN的多分辨率神经网络，并将高斯滤波应用于扩展的CRF核邻域和标签图像，以降低CRF神经网络分割的振荡效果，从而实现更高的精度和更快的训练速度。
