##### Abstract
We propose an approach to learning agents for active robotic mapping, where the goal is to map the environment as quickly as possible. The agent learns to map efficiently in simulated environments by receiving rewards corresponding to how fast it constructs an accurate map. In contrast to prior work, this approach learns an exploration policy based on a user-specified prior over environment configurations and sensor model, allowing it to specialize to the specifications. We evaluate the approach through a simulated Disaster Mapping scenario and find that it achieves performance slightly better than a near-optimal myopic exploration scheme, suggesting that it could be useful in more complicated problem scenarios.

我们提出了一种学习主动机器人映射的代理方法，其目标是尽可能快地映射环境。代理学习在模拟环境中高效地进行映射，通过接收与构建精确映射的速度相对应的奖励。与之前的工作相比，这种方法基于用户指定的先前的环境配置和传感器模型来学习勘探策略，从而使其专门针对规范。我们通过一个模拟的灾难映射场景来评估这个方法，发现它比一个近乎最佳的近视探测方案稍微好一点，表明它可能在更复杂的问题场景中有用。
