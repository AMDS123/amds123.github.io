##### Abstract
Different empirical models have been developed for cloud detection. There is a growing interest in using the ground-based sky/cloud images for this purpose. Several methods exist that perform binary segmentation of clouds. In this paper, we propose to use a deep learning architecture (U-Net) to perform multi-label sky/cloud image segmentation. The proposed approach outperforms recent literature by a large margin.
