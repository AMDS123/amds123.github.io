##### Abstract
In this paper, the task of recognizing signs made by hearing impaired people at sentence level has been addressed. A novel method of extracting spatial features to capture hand movements of a signer has been proposed. Frames of a given video of a sign are preprocessed to extract face and hand components of a signer. The local centroids of the extracted components along with the global centroid are exploited to extract spatial features. The concept of interval valued type symbolic data has been explored to capture variations in the same sign made by the different signers at different instances of time. A suitable symbolic similarity measure is studied to establish matching between test and reference signs and a simple nearest neighbour classifier is used to recognize an unknown sign as one among the known signs by specifying a desired level of threshold. An extensive experimentation is conducted on a considerably large database of signs created by us during the course of research work in order to evaluate the performance of the proposed system

在这篇文章中，解决了听力受损人士在句子层面所做的标志的任务。已经提出了一种提取空间特征以捕获签名者手部运动的新方法。对符号的给定视频的帧进行预处理以提取签名者的脸部和手部分。提取的组件的局部质心连同整体质心被利用来提取空间特征。已经探索了区间值类型符号数据的概念，以捕捉不同签名者在不同时间所做的相同符号的变化。研究适合的符号相似性度量以建立测试和参考符号之间的匹配，并且通过指定期望的阈值水平，使用简单的最近邻分类器来将未知符号识别为已知符号中的一个。我们在研究工作过程中对我们创建的相当大的标志数据库进行了广泛的实验，以评估所提议的系统的性能
