##### Abstract
Studying caricature recognition is fundamentally important to understanding of face perception. However, little research has been conducted in the computer vision community, largely due to the shortage of suitable datasets. In this paper, a new caricature dataset is built, with the objective to facilitate research in caricature recognition. All the caricatures and face images were collected from the Web. Compared with two existing datasets, this dataset is much more challenging, with a much greater number of available images, artistic styles and larger intra-personal variations. Evaluation protocols are also offered together with their baseline performances on the dataset to allow fair comparisons. Besides, a framework for caricature face recognition is presented to make a thorough analyze of the challenges of caricature recognition. By analyzing the challenges, the goal is to show problems that worth to be further investigated. Additionally, based on the evaluation protocols and the framework, baseline performances of various state-of-the-art algorithms are provided. A conclusion is that there is still a large space for performance improvement and the analyzed problems still need further investigation.

研究漫画识别对于理解面部感知至关重要。然而，在计算机视觉社区中进行的研究很少，主要是由于缺乏合适的数据集。在本文中，建立了一个新的漫画数据集，目的是促进漫画识别的研究。所有的漫画和面部图像都是从网上收集的。与现有的两个数据集相比，该数据集更具挑战性，可用图像数量更多，艺术风格更大，个人内部变化更大。还提供评估协议以及它们在数据集上的基线性能，以进行公平比较。此外，还提出了一个漫画人脸识别框架，以全面分析漫画识别的挑战。通过分析挑战，目标是展示值得进一步研究的问题。另外，基于评估协议和框架，提供了各种现有算法的基线性能。结论是，性能改进仍有很大的空间，分析的问题仍有待进一步研究。
