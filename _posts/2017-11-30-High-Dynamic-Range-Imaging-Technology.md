##### Abstract
In this lecture note, we describe high dynamic range (HDR) imaging systems; such systems are able to represent luminances of much larger brightness and, typically, also a larger range of colors than conventional standard dynamic range (SDR) imaging systems. The larger luminance range greatly improve the overall quality of visual content, making it appears much more realistic and appealing to observers. HDR is one of the key technologies of the future imaging pipeline, which will change the way the digital visual content is represented and manipulated today.

在本讲座中，我们描述了高动态范围（HDR）成像系统;这样的系统能够表现出比传统的标准动态范围（SDR）成像系统更高的亮度的亮度，并且典型地还具有更大范围的颜色。较大的亮度范围大大提高了视觉内容的整体质量，使其显得更加逼真和吸引观众。 HDR是未来成像管道的关键技术之一，它将改变当今数字视频内容的表现和操纵方式。
