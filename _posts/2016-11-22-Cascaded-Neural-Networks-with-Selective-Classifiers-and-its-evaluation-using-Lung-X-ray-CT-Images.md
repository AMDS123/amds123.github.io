##### Abstract
Lung nodule detection is a class imbalanced problem because nodules are found with much lower frequency than non-nodules. In the class imbalanced problem, conventional classifiers tend to be overwhelmed by the majority class and ignore the minority class. We therefore propose cascaded convolutional neural networks to cope with the class imbalanced problem. In the proposed approach, cascaded convolutional neural networks that perform as selective classifiers filter out obvious non-nodules. Successively, a convolutional neural network trained with a balanced data set calculates nodule probabilities. The proposed method achieved the detection sensitivity of 85.3% and 90.7% at 1 and 4 false positives per scan in FROC curve, respectively.

肺结节检测是一类不平衡的问题，因为发现结节的频率远远低于非结节。在阶级失衡的问题上，传统的分类者倾向于被大多数阶级所淹没，而忽视了少数阶级。因此，我们提出级联卷积神经网络来应对类不平衡问题。在所提出的方法中，作为选择性分类器执行的级联卷积神经网络滤除明显的非结节。随后，用平衡数据集训练的卷积神经网络计算结节概率。所提出的方法在FROC曲线上每次扫描1次和4次假阳性时分别实现了85.3％和90.7％的检测灵敏度。
