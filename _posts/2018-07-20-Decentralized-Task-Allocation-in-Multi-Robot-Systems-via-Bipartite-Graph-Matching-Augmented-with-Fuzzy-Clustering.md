##### Abstract
Robotic systems, working together as a team, are becoming valuable players in different real-world applications, from disaster response to warehouse fulfillment services. Centralized solutions for coordinating multi-robot teams often suffer from poor scalability and vulnerability to communication disruptions. This paper develops a decentralized multi-agent task allocation (Dec-MATA) algorithm for multi-robot applications. The task planning problem is posed as a maximum-weighted matching of a bipartite graph, the solution of which using the blossom algorithm allows each robot to autonomously identify the optimal sequence of tasks it should undertake. The graph weights are determined based on a soft clustering process, which also plays a problem decomposition role seeking to reduce the complexity of the individual-agents' task assignment problems. To evaluate the new Dec-MATA algorithm, a series of case studies (of varying complexity) are performed, with tasks being distributed randomly over an observable 2D environment. A centralized approach, based on a state-of-the-art MILP formulation of the multi-Traveling Salesman problem is used for comparative analysis. While getting within 7-28% of the optimal cost obtained by the centralized algorithm, the Dec-MATA algorithm is found to be 1-3 orders of magnitude faster and minimally sensitive to task-to-robot ratios, unlike the centralized algorithm.

机器人系统作为一个团队一起工作，正在成为不同实际应用中的重要参与者，从灾难响应到仓库履行服务。用于协调多机器人团队的集中式解决方案通常具有较差的可扩展性和易受通信中断的影响。本文为多机器人应用开发了一种分散的多智能体任务分配（Dec-MATA）算法。任务规划问题被提出为二分图的最大加权匹配，其解决方案使用开花算法允许每个机器人自主地识别它应该执行的最佳任务序列。基于软聚类过程确定图权重，该软聚类过程还起到问题分解作用，寻求降低个体代理的任务分配问题的复杂性。为了评估新的Dec-MATA算法，执行了一系列案例研究（具有不同的复杂性），任务在可观察的2D环境中随机分布。基于多旅行商问题的最新MILP公式的集中方法用于比较分析。在集中算法获得的最优成本的7-28％范围内，与集中式算法不同，Dec-MATA算法的速度快了1-3个数量级，对任务到机器人的比率最不敏感。
