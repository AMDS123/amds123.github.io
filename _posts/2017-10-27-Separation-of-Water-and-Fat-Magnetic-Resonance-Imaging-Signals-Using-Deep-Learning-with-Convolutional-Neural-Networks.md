##### Abstract
Purpose: A new method for magnetic resonance (MR) imaging water-fat separation using a convolutional neural network (ConvNet) and deep learning (DL) is presented. Feasibility of the method with complex and magnitude images is demonstrated with a series of patient studies and accuracy of predicted quantitative values is analyzed. Methods: Water-fat separation of 1200 gradient-echo acquisitions from 90 imaging sessions (normal, acute and chronic myocardial infarction) was performed using a conventional model based method with modeling of R2* and off-resonance and a multi-peak fat spectrum. A U-Net convolutional neural network for calculation of water-only, fat-only, R2* and off-resonance images was trained with 900 gradient-echo Multiple and single-echo complex and magnitude input data algorithms were studied and compared to conventional extended echo modeling. Results: The U-Net ConvNet was easily trained and provided water-fat separation results visually comparable to conventional methods. Myocardial fat deposition in chronic myocardial infarction and intramyocardial hemorrhage in acute myocardial infarction were well visualized in the DL results. Predicted values for R2*, off-resonance, water and fat signal intensities were well correlated with conventional model based water fat separation (R2>=0.97, p<0.001). DL images had a 14% higher signal-to-noise ratio (p<0.001) when compared to the conventional method. Conclusion: Deep learning utilizing ConvNets is a feasible method for MR water-fat separationimaging with complex, magnitude and single echo image data. A trained U-Net can be efficiently used for MR water-fat separation, providing results comparable to conventional model based methods.

目的：提出一种使用卷积神经网络（ConvNet）和深度学习（DL）的磁共振（MR）成像水脂分离新方法。通过一系列患者的研究，证明了方法的复杂性和幅度性的可行性，并分析了预测量化值的准确性。方法：使用传统的基于模型的方法进行来自90个成像阶段（正常，急性和慢性心肌梗塞）的1200个梯度回波采集的水脂分离，所述方法具有R2 *和非共振模型以及多峰脂肪谱。使用900个梯度回波训练用于计算纯水，仅含脂肪，R2 *和非共振图像的U-Net卷积神经网络。对多个和单个回波复数和幅度输入数据算法进行了研究，并与传统扩展回声建模。结果：U-Net ConvNet很容易被训练，并提供与常规方法在视觉上相媲美的水脂分离结果。慢性心肌梗塞心肌脂肪沉积和急性心肌梗死心肌内出血在DL结果中很好地显现。 R2 *，非共振，水和脂肪信号强度的预测值与传统的基于模型的水脂分离（R2> = 0.97，p <0.001）密切相关。与常规方法相比，DL图像具有高14％的信噪比（p <0.001）。结论：利用ConvNets进行深度学习是一种复杂，大小和单一回波图像数据的MR水脂分离成像的可行方法。训练有素的U-Net可以有效地用于MR水脂分离，提供与传统的基于模型的方法相媲美的结果。
