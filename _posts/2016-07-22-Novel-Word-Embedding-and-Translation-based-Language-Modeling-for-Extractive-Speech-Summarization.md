##### Abstract
Word embedding methods revolve around learning continuous distributed vector representations of words with neural networks, which can capture semantic and/or syntactic cues, and in turn be used to induce similarity measures among words, sentences and documents in context. Celebrated methods can be categorized as prediction-based and count-based methods according to the training objectives and model architectures. Their pros and cons have been extensively analyzed and evaluated in recent studies, but there is relatively less work continuing the line of research to develop an enhanced learning method that brings together the advantages of the two model families. In addition, the interpretation of the learned word representations still remains somewhat opaque. Motivated by the observations and considering the pressing need, this paper presents a novel method for learning the word representations, which not only inherits the advantages of classic word embedding methods but also offers a clearer and more rigorous interpretation of the learned word representations. Built upon the proposed word embedding method, we further formulate a translation-based language modeling framework for the extractive speech summarization task. A series of empirical evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed word representation learning and language modeling techniques in extractive speech summarization.

##### Abstract (translated by Google)
词嵌入方法围绕着学习神经网络连续分布的单词向量表示，它可以捕捉语义和/或语法提示，反过来又可以用来在语境，句子和文档之间引入相似性度量。根据培训目标和模型架构，着名的方法可以分为基于预测和基于计数的方法。他们的利弊在最近的研究中得到了广泛的分析和评价，但是继续研究开发一种综合了两个模型家族优点的增强学习方法的工作相对较少。此外，学习词汇表达的解释仍然有些不透明。受观察的启发和考虑到迫切的需要，本文提出了一种新颖的词表示方法，它不仅继承了经典词语嵌入方法的优点，而且对学习词表示方式提供了更为清晰，更为严谨的解释。在提出的词语嵌入方法的基础上，进一步为抽象语音摘要任务制定了基于翻译的语言建模框架。一系列的实证评估证明了所提出的词表征学习和语言建模技术在提取语音摘要中的有效性。
