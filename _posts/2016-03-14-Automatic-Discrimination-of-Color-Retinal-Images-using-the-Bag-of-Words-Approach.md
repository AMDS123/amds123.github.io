##### Abstract
Diabetic retinopathy (DR) and age related macular degeneration (ARMD) are among the major causes of visual impairment worldwide. DR is mainly characterized by red spots, namely microaneurysms and bright lesions, specifically exudates whereas ARMD is mainly identified by tiny yellow or white deposits called drusen. Since exudates might be the only manifestation of the early diabetic retinopathy, there is an increase demand for automatic retinopathy diagnosis. Exudates and drusen may share similar appearances, thus discriminating between them is of interest to enhance screening performance. In this research, we investigative the role of bag of words approach in the automatic diagnosis of retinopathy diabetes. We proposed to use a single based and multiple based methods for the construction of the visual dictionary by combining the histogram of word occurrences from each dictionary and building a single histogram. The introduced approach is evaluated for automatic diagnosis of normal and abnormal color fundus images with bright lesions. This approach has been implemented on 430 fundus images, including six publicly available datasets, in addition to one local dataset. The mean accuracies reported are 97.2% and 99.77% for single based and multiple based dictionaries respectively.

糖尿病视网膜病变（DR）和年龄相关性黄斑变性（ARMD）是全球视力损害的主要原因之一。 DR主要表现为红色斑点，即微动脉瘤和明亮的病变，特别是渗出物，而ARMD主要由被称为玻璃疣的微小黄色或白色沉积物识别。由于渗出物可能是早期糖尿病视网膜病变的唯一表现，因此对自动视网膜病变诊断的需求增加。渗出物和玻璃疣可能具有相似的外观，因此区分它们有利于提高筛选性能。在这项研究中，我们调查了词袋方法在糖尿病视网膜病变自动诊断中的作用。我们提出使用基于单个和多个基础的方法来构建视觉词典，通过组合每个词典中的词语出现的直方图并构建单个直方图。评估介绍的方法可以自动诊断明亮病变的正常和异常彩色眼底图像。除了一个本地数据集之外，这一方法已经在430个眼底图像上执行，包括六个公开可用的数据集。单词和多词典的平均准确率分别为97.2％和99.77％。
