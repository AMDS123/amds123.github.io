##### Abstract
This paper makes the case that while most research on intelligent agents presently centers on the agent and not on the user, the opposite should be true. Covering slot-filling, gaming and chatbot agents, it looks at where the tendency to attend to the agent has come from and why it is important to concentrate more on the user. After reviewing relevant literature, we propose some first approaches to creating and assessing user-centric systems.
