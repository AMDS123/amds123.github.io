##### Abstract
Conditional Random Field (CRF) and recurrent neural models have achieved success in structured prediction. More recently, there is a marriage of CRF and recurrent neural models, so that we can gain from both non-linear dense features and globally normalized CRF objective. These recurrent neural CRF models mainly focus on encode node features in CRF undirected graphs. However, edge features prove important to CRF in structured prediction. In this work, we introduce a new recurrent neural CRF model, which learns non-linear edge features, and thus makes non-linear features encoded completely. We compare our model with different neural models in well-known structured prediction tasks. Experiments show that our model outperforms state-of-the-art methods in NP chunking, shallow parsing, Chinese word segmentation and POS tagging.

条件随机场（CRF）和递归神经模型在结构化预测中取得了成功。最近，CRF和递归神经模型结合在一起，所以我们可以从非线性密集特征和全球标准化的CRF目标中获得。这些递归的神经CRF模型主要集中在CRF无向图中的编码节点特征。然而，在结构化预测中，边缘特征对于CRF很重要。在这项工作中，我们引入一个新的递归神经CRF模型，学习非线性边缘特征，从而使非线性特征完全编码。我们将我们的模型与众所周知的结构预测任务中的不同神经模型进行比较实验表明，我们的模型在NP分块，浅解析，中文分词和POS标记方面优于现有技术。
