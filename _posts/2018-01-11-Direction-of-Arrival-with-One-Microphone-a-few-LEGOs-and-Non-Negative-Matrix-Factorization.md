##### Abstract
Conventional approaches to sound source localization require at least two microphones. It is known, however, that people with unilateral hearing loss can also localize sounds. Monaural localization is possible thanks to the scattering by the head, though it hinges on learning the spectra of the various sources. We take inspiration from this human ability to propose algorithms for accurate sound source localization using a single microphone embedded in an arbitrary scattering structure. The structure modifies the frequency response of the microphone in a direction-dependent way giving each direction a signature. While knowing those signatures is sufficient to localize sources of white noise, localizing speech is much more challenging: it is an ill-posed inverse problem which we regularize by prior knowledge in the form of learned non-negative dictionaries. We demonstrate a monaural speech localization algorithm based on non-negative matrix factorization that does not depend on sophisticated, designed scatterers. In fact, we show experimental results with ad hoc scatterers made of LEGO bricks. Even with these rudimentary structures we can accurately localize arbitrary speakers; that is, we do not need to learn the dictionary for the particular speaker to be localized. Finally, we discuss multi-source localization and the related limitations of our approach.

常规的声源定位方法需要至少两个麦克风。但是，众所周知，单侧听力损失者也可以定位声音。由于头部的散射，单声道定位是可能的，尽管它取决于学习各种光源的光谱。我们从这个人类的能力中获得灵感，提出使用嵌入在任意散射结构中的单个麦克风精确声源定位的算法。该结构以方向依赖的方式修改麦克风的频率响应，给每个方向一个签名。虽然知道这些签名是足够的本地化的白噪声来源，本地化语音更具挑战性：这是一个病态的反问题，我们通过学习的非负字典形式的先验知识正规化。我们演示了基于非负矩阵分解的单声道语音定位算法，不依赖于复杂的设计散射体。事实上，我们用由乐高积木制成的特别散射体来展示实验结果。即使有了这些基本的结构，我们也可以准确地定位任意说话人;也就是说，我们不需要学习特定讲话者的字典来进行本地化。最后，我们讨论多源本地化和我们的方法的相关限制。
