##### Abstract
We present CAM (comparative argumentative machine), a novel open-domain IR system to argumentatively compare objects with respect to information extracted from the Common Crawl. In a user study, the participants obtained 15% more accurate answers using CAM compared to a "traditional" keyword-based search and were 20% faster in finding the answer to comparative questions.
