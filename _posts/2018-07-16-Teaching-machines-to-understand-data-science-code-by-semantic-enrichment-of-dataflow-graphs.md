##### Abstract
Your computer is continuously executing programs, but does it really understand them? Not in any meaningful sense. That burden falls upon human knowledge workers, who are increasingly asked to write and understand code. They would benefit greatly from intelligent tools that reveal the connections between their code and its subject matter. Towards this prospect, we develop an AI system that forms semantic representations of computer programs, using techniques from knowledge representation and program analysis. We focus on code written for data science, although our method is more generally applicable. The semantic representations are created through a novel algorithm for the semantic enrichment of dataflow graphs. This algorithm is undergirded by a new ontology language for modeling computer programs and a new ontology about data science, written in this language.

您的计算机正在不断执行程序，但是它真的理解它们吗？没有任何意义。这种负担落在人类知识工作者身上，他们越来越多地被要求编写和理解代码。他们将从智能工具中获益，这些工具揭示了他们的代码与其主题之间的联系。面对这一前景，我们开发了一个人工智能系统，利用知识表示和程序分析技术，形成计算机程序的语义表示。我们专注于为数据科学编写的代码，尽管我们的方法更普遍适用。通过用于数据流图的语义丰富的新算法来创建语义表示。该算法由用于建模计算机程序的新本体语言和用该语言编写的关于数据科学的新本体论所支撑。
