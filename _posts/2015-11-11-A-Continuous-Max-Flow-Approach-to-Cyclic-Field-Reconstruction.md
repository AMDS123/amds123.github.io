##### Abstract
Reconstruction of an image from noisy data using Markov Random Field theory has been explored by both the graph-cuts and continuous max-flow community in the form of the Potts and Ishikawa models. However, neither model takes into account the particular cyclic topology of specific intensity types such as the hue in natural colour images, or the phase in complex valued MRI. This paper presents \textit{cyclic continuous max-flow} image reconstruction which models the intensity being reconstructed as having a fundamentally cyclic topology. This model complements the Ishikawa model in that it is designed with image reconstruction in mind, having the topology of the intensity space inherent in the model while being readily extendable to an arbitrary intensity resolution.

已经通过Potts和Ishikawa模型形式的图形切割和连续最大流社区探索了利用马尔可夫随机场理论从噪声数据重建图像。然而，两种模型都没有考虑特定强度类型的特定循环拓扑结构，例如自然彩色图像中的色调，或者复杂值的MRI中的相位。本文提出了\ textit {循环连续最大流量}图像重建，它将重建的强度建模为具有基本的循环拓扑。这个模型与Ishikawa模型相辅相成，因为它考虑了图像重建的设计，具有模型固有的强度空间的拓扑结构，同时可以容易地扩展到任意的强度分辨率。
