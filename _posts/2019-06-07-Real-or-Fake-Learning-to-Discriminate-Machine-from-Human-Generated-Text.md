##### Abstract
Recent advances in generative modeling of text have demonstrated remarkable improvements in terms of fluency and coherency. In this work we investigate to which extent a machine can discriminate real from machine generated text. This is important in itself for automatic detection of computer generated stories, but can also serve as a tool for further improving text generation. We show that learning a dedicated scoring function to discriminate between real and fake text achieves higher precision than employing the likelihood of a generative model. The scoring functions generalize to other generators than those used for training as long as these generators have comparable model complexity and are trained on similar datasets.
