##### Abstract
The recently proposed stochastic residual networks selectively activate or bypass the layers during training, based on independent stochastic choices, each of which following a probability distribution that is fixed in advance. In this paper we present a first exploration on the use of an epoch-dependent distribution, starting with a higher probability of bypassing deeper layers and then activating them more frequently as training progresses. Preliminary results are mixed, yet they show some potential of adding an epoch-dependent management of distributions, worth of further investigation.

最近提出的随机残留网络基于独立的随机选择在训练期间选择性地激活或绕过层，每个随机选择都遵循预先确定的概率分布。在本文中，我们首先探讨如何使用依赖于时代的分布，从较高的概率越过较深的层次开始，然后随着训练的进行更频繁地激活它们。初步的结果是混合的，但它们显示出一些潜力，增加分布的时代依赖管理，值得进一步调查。
