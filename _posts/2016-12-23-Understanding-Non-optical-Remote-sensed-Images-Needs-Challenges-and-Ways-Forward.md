##### Abstract
Non-optical remote-sensed images are going to be used more often in man- aging disaster, crime and precision agriculture. With more small satellites and unmanned air vehicles planning to carry radar and hyperspectral image sensors there is going to be an abundance of such data in the recent future. Understanding these data in real-time will be crucial in attaining some of the important sustain- able development goals. Processing non-optical images is, in many ways, different from that of optical images. Most of the recent advances in the domain of image understanding has been using optical images. In this article we shall explain the needs for image understanding in non-optical domain and the typical challenges. Then we shall describe the existing approaches and how we can move from there to the desired goal of a reliable real-time image understanding system.

##### Abstract (translated by Google)
非光学遥感图像将更多地用于管理灾难，犯罪和精准农业。随着越来越多的小型卫星和无人飞行器计划搭载雷达和高光谱图像传感器，近期将有大量的这类数据。实时了解这些数据对于实现一些重要的可持续发展目标至关重要。处理非光学图像在许多方面不同于光学图像。图像理解领域的最新进展大部分都是使用光学图像。在这篇文章中，我们将解释在非光学领域的图像理解的需求和典型的挑战。然后，我们将描述现有的方法，以及如何从那里移动到一个可靠的实时图像理解系统的预期目标。
