##### Abstract
Reinforcement Learning (RL) is a research area that has blossomed tremendously in recent years and has shown remarkable potential in among others successfully playing computer games. However, there only exists a few game platforms that provide diversity in tasks and state-space needed to advance RL algorithms. The existing platforms offer RL access to Atari- and a few web-based games, but no platform fully expose access to Flash games. This is unfortunate because applying RL to Flash games have potential to push the research of RL algorithms. 
 This paper introduces the Flash Reinforcement Learning platform (FlashRL) which attempts to fill this gap by providing an environment for thousands of Flash games on a novel platform for Flash automation. It opens up easy experimentation with RL algorithms for Flash games, which has previously been challenging. The platform shows excellent performance with as little as 5% CPU utilization on consumer hardware. It shows promising results for novel reinforcement learning algorithms.

强化学习（RL）是近年来蓬勃发展的研究领域，在成功玩电脑游戏方面显示了巨大的潜力。然而，只有少数几个游戏平台提供了推进RL算法所需的任务和状态空间的多样性。现有的平台提供RL访问Atari和一些基于网络的游戏，但没有任何平台可以完全暴露Flash游戏。这是不幸的，因为将RL应用于Flash游戏有潜力推动RL算法的研究。
 本文介绍了闪存强化学习平台（FlashRL），试图填补这一空白，为Flash自动化提供了一个新颖的平台上数以千计的Flash游戏的环境。它为Flash游戏的RL算法开辟了一个简单的实验，这在以前一直是个挑战。该平台在消费型硬件上的CPU使用率仅为5％，性能卓越。它显示了新的强化学习算法有希望的结果。
