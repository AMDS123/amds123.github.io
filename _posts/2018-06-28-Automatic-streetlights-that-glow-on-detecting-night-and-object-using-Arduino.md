##### Abstract
Our manuscript aims to develop a system which will lead to energy conservation and by doing so, we would be able to lighten few more homes. The proposed work is accomplished by using Arduino microcontroller and sensors that will control the electricity based on night and object's detection. Meanwhile, a counter is set that will count the number of objects passed through the road. The beauty of the proposed work is that the wastage of unused electricity can be reduced, lifetime of the streetlights gets enhance because the lights do not stay ON during the whole night, and helps to increase safety measurements. We are confident that the proposed idea will be beneficial in the future applications of microcontrollers and sensors etc.

我们的手稿旨在开发一个能够节约能源的系统，通过这样做，我们将能够减少更多的家庭。所提出的工作是通过使用Arduino微控制器和传感器来实现的，这些传感器将根据夜晚和物体的检测来控制电力。同时，设置一个计数器来计算通过道路的物体数量。拟议工作的美妙之处在于可以减少未使用的电力的浪费，由于灯在整个夜晚都不会保持开启状态，所以路灯的使用寿命得以提高，并且有助于增加安全测量。我们相信，所提出的想法将有益于微控制器和传感器的未来应用。
