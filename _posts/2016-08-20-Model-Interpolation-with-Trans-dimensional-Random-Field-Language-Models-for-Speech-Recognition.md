##### Abstract
The dominant language models (LMs) such as n-gram and neural network (NN) models represent sentence probabilities in terms of conditionals. In contrast, a new trans-dimensional random field (TRF) LM has been recently introduced to show superior performances, where the whole sentence is modeled as a random field. In this paper, we examine how the TRF models can be interpolated with the NN models, and obtain 12.1\% and 17.9\% relative error rate reductions over 6-gram LMs for English and Chinese speech recognition respectively through log-linear combination.

诸如n-gram和神经网络（NN）模型的主导语言模型（LM）代表条件语句的句子概率。相比之下，最近引入了一个新的跨维随机场（TRF）LM来表现出优越的性能，其中整个句子被建模为一个随机场。本文研究TRF模型如何用NN模型进行插值，通过对数 - 线性组合，分别得到6个语音识别的相对误差率分别降低12.1％和17.9％。
