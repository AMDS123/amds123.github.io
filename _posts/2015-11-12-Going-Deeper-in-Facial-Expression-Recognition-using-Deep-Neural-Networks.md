##### Abstract
Automated Facial Expression Recognition (FER) has remained a challenging and interesting problem. Despite efforts made in developing various methods for FER, existing approaches traditionally lack generalizability when applied to unseen images or those that are captured in wild setting. Most of the existing approaches are based on engineered features (e.g. HOG, LBPH, and Gabor) where the classifier's hyperparameters are tuned to give best recognition accuracies across a single database, or a small collection of similar databases. Nevertheless, the results are not significant when they are applied to novel data. This paper proposes a deep neural network architecture to address the FER problem across multiple well-known standard face datasets. Specifically, our network consists of two convolutional layers each followed by max pooling and then four Inception layers. The network is a single component architecture that takes registered facial images as the input and classifies them into either of the six basic or the neutral expressions. We conducted comprehensive experiments on seven publically available facial expression databases, viz. MultiPIE, MMI, CK+, DISFA, FERA, SFEW, and FER2013. The results of proposed architecture are comparable to or better than the state-of-the-art methods and better than traditional convolutional neural networks and in both accuracy and training time.

自动化的面部表情识别（FER）仍然是一个充满挑战和有趣的问题。尽管在开发各种FER方法方面做出了努力，但现有的方法在应用于看不见的图像或在野外拍摄的图像时，传统上缺乏普遍性。现有的大多数方法都是基于工程特征（例如HOG，LBPH和Gabor），其中分类器的超参数被调整为在单个数据库或类似数据库的小集合上提供最佳识别精度。然而，将这些结果应用于新数据的结果并不显着。本文提出了一种深度神经网络架构来解决跨多个众所周知的标准人脸数据集的FER问题。具体而言，我们的网络由两个卷积层组成，每个卷积层都有最大池，然后是四个Inception层。网络是一个单一的组件架构，将注册的面部图像作为输入，并将它们分类为六个基本或中性表达式之一。我们对七个公开的面部表情数据库进行了全面的实验， MultiPIE，MMI，CK +，DISFA，FERA，SFEW和FER2013。所提出的架构的结果与现有技术的方法相比甚至更好，并且比传统的卷积神经网络更精确和训练时间更好。
