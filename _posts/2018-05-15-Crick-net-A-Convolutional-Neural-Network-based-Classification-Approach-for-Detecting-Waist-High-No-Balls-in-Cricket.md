##### Abstract
Cricket is undoubtedly one of the most popular games in this modern era. As human beings are prone to error, there remains a constant need for automated analysis and decision making of different events in this game. Simultaneously, with advent and advances in Artificial Intelligence and Computer Vision, application of these two in different domains has become an emerging trend. Applying several computer vision techniques in analyzing different Cricket events and automatically coming into decisions has become popular in recent days. In this paper, we have deployed a CNN based classification method with Inception V3 in order to automatically detect and differentiate waist high no balls with fair balls. Our approach achieves an overall average accuracy of 88% with a fairly low cross-entropy value.

蟋蟀无疑是这个现代时代最受欢迎的游戏之一。由于人类很容易出错，因此在这个游戏中仍然需要对自动分析和决策制定不同的事件。同时，随着人工智能和计算机视觉的发展和进步，这两者在不同领域的应用已成为一种新兴趋势。应用多种计算机视觉技术分析不同的板球事件并自动进入决策已成为最近流行的趋势。在本文中，我们使用Inception V3部署了一种基于CNN的分类方法，以便自动检测和区分高腰无球与公平球。我们的方法在交叉熵值相当低的情况下实现了88％的整体平均准确率。
