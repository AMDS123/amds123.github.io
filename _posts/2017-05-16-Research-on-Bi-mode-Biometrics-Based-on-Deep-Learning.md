##### Abstract
In view of the fact that biological characteristics have excellent independent distinguishing characteristics,biometric identification technology involves almost all the relevant areas of human distinction. Fingerprints, iris, face, voice-print and other biological features have been widely used in the public security departments to detect detection, mobile equipment unlock, target tracking and other fields. With the use of electronic devices more and more widely and the frequency is getting higher and higher. Only the Biometrics identification technology with excellent recognition rate can guarantee the long-term development of these fields.

##### Abstract (translated by Google)
鉴于生物特征具有极好的独立识别特性，生物识别技术几乎涉及到人类区别的所有相关领域。指纹，虹膜，脸部，声纹等生物特征已被广泛应用于公安部门检测，移动设备解锁，目标跟踪等领域。随着电子设备的使用越来越广泛，频率越来越高。只有识别率高的生物识别技术才能保证这些领域的长期发展。
