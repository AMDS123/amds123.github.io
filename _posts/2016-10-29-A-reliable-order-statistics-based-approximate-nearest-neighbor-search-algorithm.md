##### Abstract
We propose a new algorithm for fast approximate nearest neighbor search based on the properties of ordered vectors. Data vectors are classified based on the index and sign of their largest components, thereby partitioning the space in a number of cones centered in the origin. The query is itself classified, and the search starts from the selected cone and proceeds to neighboring ones. Overall, the proposed algorithm corresponds to locality sensitive hashing in the space of directions, with hashing based on the order of components. Thanks to the statistical features emerging through ordering, it deals very well with the challenging case of unstructured data, and is a valuable building block for more complex techniques dealing with structured data. Experiments on both simulated and real-world data prove the proposed algorithm to provide a state-of-the-art performance.

基于有序向量的性质，提出了一种新的快速近似最近邻搜索算法。数据向量根据其最大分量的索引和符号进行分类，从而划分以原点为中心的多个锥体中的空间。查询本身是分类的，搜索从所选的锥体开始并继续到相邻的锥体。总体而言，所提出的算法对应于方向空间中的局部敏感散列，并且基于分量的顺序进行散列。由于通过排序而出现的统计特征，它非常适合非结构化数据的挑战性情况，并且是处理结构化数据的更复杂技术的宝贵构建模块。对模拟和实际数据的实验都证明了所提出的算法提供了最先进的性能。
