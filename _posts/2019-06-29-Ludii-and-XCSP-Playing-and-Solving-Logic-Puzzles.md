##### Abstract
Many of the famous single-player games, commonly called puzzles, can be shown to be NP-Complete. Indeed, this class of complexity contains hundreds of puzzles, since people particularly appreciate completing an intractable puzzle, such as Sudoku, but also enjoy the ability to check their solution easily once it's done. For this reason, using constraint programming is naturally suited to solve them. In this paper, we focus on logic puzzles described in the Ludii general game system and we propose using the XCSP formalism in order to solve them with any CSP solver.
