##### Abstract
Following letter introduces a theoretical approach to investigate the effect of two-step GaN barrier layer growth methodology on the performance of InGaN/GaN MQW solar cell, in which a lower temperature GaN cap layer was grown on top of each quantum well followed by a higher temperature GaN barrier layer. Different growth conditions would cause changes in the concentration of trap level density of states and imperfection sites. The simulation and comparison of 3 samples each with different cap layer thickness, reveals the fact that increasing cap layer thickness results in higher quantum efficiency, improved short circuit density of current and 3.2% increase of the fill factor.
