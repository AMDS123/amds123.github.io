##### Abstract
Automatic speech recognition (ASR) and Text to speech (TTS) are two prominent area of research in human computer interaction nowadays. A set of phonetically rich sentences is in a matter of importance in order to develop these two interactive modules of HCI. Essentially, the set of phonetically rich sentences has to cover all possible phone units distributed uniformly. Selecting such a set from a big corpus with maintaining phonetic characteristic based similarity is still a challenging problem. The major objective of this paper is to devise a criteria in order to select a set of sentences encompassing all phonetic aspects of a corpus with size as minimum as possible. First, this paper presents a statistical analysis of Hindi phonetics by observing the structural characteristics. Further a two stage algorithm is proposed to extract phonetically rich sentences with a high variety of triphones from the EMILLE Hindi corpus. The algorithm consists of a distance measuring criteria to select a sentence in order to improve the triphone distribution. Moreover, a special preprocessing method is proposed to score each triphone in terms of inverse probability in order to fasten the algorithm. The results show that the approach efficiently build uniformly distributed phonetically-rich corpus with optimum number of sentences.

自动语音识别（ASR）和文本到语音（TTS）是当今人机交互研究的两个突出领域。为了开发这两个人机交互模块，一套语音丰富的句子是重要的。从本质上讲，这套语音丰富的句子必须覆盖所有可能的电话单元。从一个大的语料库中选择这样一个保持基于语音特征的相似性的集合仍然是一个具有挑战性的问题。本文的主要目标是设计一个标准，以便选择一个包含大小尽可能最小的语料库的所有语音方面的句子。首先，通过观察印度语语音结构特征，对印度语语音进行统计分析。此外，还提出了一个两阶段算法来从EMILLE北印度语语料库中提取各种三音素的语音丰富的句子。该算法包括一个距离测量标准来选择一个句子，以改善triphone分布。此外，还提出了一种特殊的预处理方法，以反向概率的方式对每个triphone进行评分，以加快算法的执行速度。结果表明，该方法能够有效地构建均匀分布的语音丰富的语料库，并且具有最佳句子数。
