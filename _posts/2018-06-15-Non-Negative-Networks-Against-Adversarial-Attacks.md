##### Abstract
Adversarial attacks against Neural Networks are a problem of considerable importance, for which effective defenses are not yet readily available. We make progress toward this problem by showing that non-negative weight constraints can be used to improve resistance in specific scenarios. In particular, we show that they can provide an effective defense for binary classification problems with asymmetric cost, such as malware or spam detection. We also show how non-negativity can be leveraged to reduce an attacker's ability to perform targeted misclassification attacks in other domains such as image processing.

##### Abstract (translated by Google)
对神经网络的对抗攻击是一个相当重要的问题，对此，有效的防御措施尚不容易获得。我们通过显示可以使用非负权重约束来提高特定情景下的抵抗力来解决这个问题。特别是，我们证明它们可以为具有不对称成本的二元分类问题（如恶意软件或垃圾邮件检测）提供有效的防御。我们还展示了如何利用非负面性来降低攻击者在其他领域（如图像处理）执行有针对性的错误分类攻击的能力。
