##### Abstract
Currently, knowledge discovery in databases is an essential step to identify valid, novel and useful patterns for decision making. There are many real-world scenarios, such as bankruptcy prediction, option pricing or medical diagnosis, where the classification models to be learned need to fulfil restrictions of monotonicity (i.e. the target class label should not decrease when input attributes values increase). For instance, it is rational to assume that a higher debt ratio of a company should never result in a lower level of bankruptcy risk. Consequently, there is a growing interest from the data mining research community concerning monotonic predictive models. This paper aims to present an overview about the literature in the field, analyzing existing techniques and proposing a taxonomy of the algorithms based on the type of model generated. For each method, we review the quality metrics considered in the evaluation and the different data sets and monotonic problems used in the analysis. In this way, this paper serves as an overview of the research about monotonic classification in specialized literature and can be used as a functional guide of the field.
