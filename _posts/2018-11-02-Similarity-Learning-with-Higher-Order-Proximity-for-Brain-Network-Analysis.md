##### Abstract
In recent years, the similarity learning problem has been widely studied. Most of the existing works focus on images and few of these works could be applied to learn similarity between neuroimages, such as fMRI images and DTI images, which are important data sources for human brain analysis. In this paper, we focus on the similarity learning for fMRI brain network analysis. We propose a general framework called "Multi-hop Siamese GCN" for similarity learning on graphs. This framework provides multiple options for refining the graph representations with high-order structure information, thus can be used for graph similarity learning on various brain network data sets. We apply the proposed Multi-hop Siamese GCN approach on four real fMRI brain network datasets for similarity learning with respect to brain health status and cognitive abilities. Our proposed method achieves an average AUC gain of 82.6% compared to PCA, and an average AUC gain of 42% compared to S-GCN across a variety of datasets, indicating its promising learning ability for clinical investigation and brain disease diagnosis.
