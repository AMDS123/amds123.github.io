##### Abstract
Deep learning works as a discrete non-linear mapping function and has achieved great success as a powerful classification tool. However, it has been overhyped in many fields. This comment takes image segmentation as a typical filed to prove this point of view. Firstly, deep learning is not omnipotent. It only generates a prediction map and relies on other segmentation methods to complete the segmentation task. Secondly, the performance of deep learning is inversely proportional to the number of outputs. Consequently, deep learning is not a good choice for image segmentation unless the resolution of the image is extremely small.
