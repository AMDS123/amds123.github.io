##### Abstract
In this paper, a method is presented for superimposition (i.e. registration) of eye fundus images from persons with diabetes screened over many years for diabetic retinopathy. The method is fully automatic and robust to camera changes and colour variations across the images both in space and time. All the stages of the process are designed for longitudinal analysis of cohort public health databases where retinal examinations are made at approximately yearly intervals. The method relies on a model correcting two radial distortions and an affine transformation between pairs of images which is robustly fitted on salient points. Each stage involves linear estimators followed by non-linear optimisation. The model of image warping is also invertible for fast computation. The method has been validated (1) on a simulated montage and (2) on public health databases with 69 patients with high quality images (271 pairs acquired mostly with different types of camera and 268 pairs acquired mostly with the same type of camera) with success rates of 92% and 98%, and five patients (20 pairs) with low quality images with a success rate of 100%. Compared to two state-of-the-art methods, ours gives better results.

在本文中，提出了一种方法，用于叠加（即登记）糖尿病视网膜病多年筛选的糖尿病患者的眼底图像。该方法是完全自动的，对于空间和时间上的图像变化和图像间的颜色变化都是强健的。该过程的所有阶段都是针对队列公共卫生数据库的纵向分析而设计的，这些数据库大约每年进行一次视网膜检查。该方法依赖于模型校正两个径向失真和在图像对之间的仿射变换，这些变换在凸点上稳健地拟合。每个阶段都涉及线性估计，然后是非线性优化。图像变形模型对于快速计算也是可逆的。该方法已被验证（1）模拟蒙太奇和（2）在公共卫生数据库与69名高质量图像患者（271对主要获得不同类型的相机和268对获得大多数相同类型的相机）与成功率分别为92％和98％，5例（20对）低质量图像，成功率为100％。与两种最先进的方法相比，我们的结果更好。
