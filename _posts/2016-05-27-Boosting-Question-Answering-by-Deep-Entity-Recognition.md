##### Abstract
In this paper an open-domain factoid question answering system for Polish, RAFAEL, is presented. The system goes beyond finding an answering sentence; it also extracts a single string, corresponding to the required entity. Herein the focus is placed on different approaches to entity recognition, essential for retrieving information matching question constraints. Apart from traditional approach, including named entity recognition (NER) solutions, a novel technique, called Deep Entity Recognition (DeepER), is introduced and implemented. It allows a comprehensive search of all forms of entity references matching a given WordNet synset (e.g. an impressionist), based on a previously assembled entity library. It has been created by analysing the first sentences of encyclopaedia entries and disambiguation and redirect pages. DeepER also provides automatic evaluation, which makes possible numerous experiments, including over a thousand questions from a quiz TV show answered on the grounds of Polish Wikipedia. The final results of a manual evaluation on a separate question set show that the strength of DeepER approach lies in its ability to answer questions that demand answers beyond the traditional categories of named entities.

在这篇文章中，提出了一个开放领域的波兰语RAFAEL问答系统。该系统超越了找到一个回答句子;它也提取单个字符串，对应于所需的实体。这里重点放在实体识别的不同方法上，这对于检索匹配问题约束的信息是必不可少的。除了传统的方法，包括命名实体识别（NER）解决方案之外，还引入了一种称为深度实体识别（DeepER）的新技术。它允许基于先前组装的实体库，全面搜索与给定的WordNet synset（例如印象派）匹配的所有形式的实体引用。它是通过分析百科全书条目的首句和消歧和重定向页面而创建的。 DeepER还提供自动评估功能，可以进行大量的实验，其中包括以波兰维基百科为基础回答的千次问题电视节目。对单独问题集进行手动评估的最终结果表明，DeepER方法的优势在于能够回答超出传统类别命名实体的问题。
