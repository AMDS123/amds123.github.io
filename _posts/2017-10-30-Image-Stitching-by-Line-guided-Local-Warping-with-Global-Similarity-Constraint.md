##### Abstract
Low-textured image stitching remains a challenging problem. It is difficult to achieve good alignment and it is easy to break image structures due to insufficient and unreliable point correspondences. Moreover, because of the viewpoint variations between multiple images, the stitched images suffer from projective distortions. To solve these problems, this paper presents a line-guided local warping method with a global similarity constraint for image stitching. Line features which serve well for geometric descriptions and scene constraints, are employed to guide image stitching accurately. On one hand, the line features are integrated into a local warping model through a designed weight function. On the other hand, line features are adopted to impose strong geometric constraints, including line correspondence and line colinearity, to improve the stitching performance through mesh optimization. To mitigate projective distortions, we adopt a global similarity constraint, which is integrated with the projective warps via a designed weight strategy. This constraint causes the final warp to slowly change from a projective to a similarity transformation across the image. Finally, the images undergo a two-stage alignment scheme that provides accurate alignment and reduces projective distortion. We evaluate our method on a series of images and compare it with several other methods. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method provides a convincing stitching performance and that it outperforms other state-of-the-art methods.

低纹理图像拼接仍然是一个具有挑战性的问题。实现良好的对齐是困难的，并且由于不充分和不可靠的点对应而容易破坏图像结构。而且，由于多个图像之间的视点变化，拼接的图像受到投影失真的影响。为了解决这些问题，本文提出了一种具有全局相似性约束的图像拼接的线引导局部翘曲方法。用于几何描述和场景约束的线条特征被用来精确地引导图像拼接。一方面，通过设计的权重函数将线条特征集成到局部翘曲模型中。另一方面，线特征被用来施加强的几何约束，包括线对应和线共线，以通过网格优化来提高拼接性能。为了减轻投影失真，我们采用全局相似性约束，通过设计的权重策略将其与投影经线结合。这个约束使得最终的变形从图像中的投影变为相似变换。最后，图像经历两级对准方案，提供准确的对准并减少投影失真。我们在一系列图像上评估我们的方法，并将其与其他几种方法进行比较。实验结果表明，所提出的方法提供了一个令人信服的拼接性能，它胜过其他最先进的方法。
