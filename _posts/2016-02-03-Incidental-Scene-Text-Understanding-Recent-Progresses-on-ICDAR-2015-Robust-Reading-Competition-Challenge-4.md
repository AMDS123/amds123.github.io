##### Abstract
Different from focused texts present in natural images, which are captured with user's intention and intervention, incidental texts usually exhibit much more diversity, variability and complexity, thus posing significant difficulties and challenges for scene text detection and recognition algorithms. The ICDAR 2015 Robust Reading Competition Challenge 4 was launched to assess the performance of existing scene text detection and recognition methods on incidental texts as well as to stimulate novel ideas and solutions. This report is dedicated to briefly introduce our strategies for this challenging problem and compare them with prior arts in this field.

与用户的意图和干预捕捉的自然图像中的焦点文本不同，附带的文本通常表现出更多的多样性，可变性和复杂性，因而给场景文本检测和识别算法带来了巨大的困难和挑战。 ICDAR 2015强劲阅读竞赛挑战赛4启动，旨在评估现有场景文字检测和识别方法对偶然文本的表现，并激发新颖的想法和解决方案。本报告旨在简要介绍我们针对这一具有挑战性问题的策略，并将其与该领域的现有技术进行比较。
