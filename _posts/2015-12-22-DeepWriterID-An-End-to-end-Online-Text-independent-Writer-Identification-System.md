##### Abstract
Owing to the rapid growth of touchscreen mobile terminals and pen-based interfaces, handwriting-based writer identification systems are attracting increasing attention for personal authentication, digital forensics, and other applications. However, most studies on writer identification have not been satisfying because of the insufficiency of data and difficulty of designing good features under various conditions of handwritings. Hence, we introduce an end-to-end system, namely DeepWriterID, employed a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) to address these problems. A key feature of DeepWriterID is a new method we are proposing, called DropSegment. It designs to achieve data augmentation and improve the generalized applicability of CNN. For sufficient feature representation, we further introduce path signature feature maps to improve performance. Experiments were conducted on the NLPR handwriting database. Even though we only use pen-position information in the pen-down state of the given handwriting samples, we achieved new state-of-the-art identification rates of 95.72% for Chinese text and 98.51% for English text.

由于触摸屏移动终端和笔式接口的快速增长，基于手写的笔迹识别系统越来越受到个人认证，数字取证等应用的重视。然而，由于数据的不足和笔迹难度大的特点，大多数笔迹鉴定研究并不令人满意。因此，我们引入一个端到端的系统，即DeepWriterID，采用深度卷积神经网络（CNN）来解决这些问题。 DeepWriterID的一个关键特性是我们提出的一种叫DropSegment的新方法。它旨在实现数据增强和提高CNN的广义适用性。为了充分表示特征，我们进一步引入路径签名特征映射来提高性能。在NLPR手写数据库上进行实验。尽管我们只在给定笔迹样本的下笔状态中使用笔位置信息，但我们实现了中文文本的95.72％和英文文本的98.51％的新的最新识别率。
