##### Abstract
Factchecking has always been a part of the journalistic process. However with newsroom budgets shrinking it is coming under increasing pressure just as the amount of false information circulating is on the rise. We therefore propose a method to increase the efficiency of the factchecking process, using the latest developments in Natural Language Processing (NLP). This method allows us to compare incoming claims to an existing corpus and return similar, factchecked, claims in a live system-allowing factcheckers to work simultaneously without duplicating their work.
