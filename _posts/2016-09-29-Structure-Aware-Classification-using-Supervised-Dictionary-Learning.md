##### Abstract
In this paper, we propose a supervised dictionary learning algorithm that aims to preserve the local geometry in both dimensions of the data. A graph-based regularization explicitly takes into account the local manifold structure of the data points. A second graph regularization gives similar treatment to the feature domain and helps in learning a more robust dictionary. Both graphs can be constructed from the training data or learned and adapted along the dictionary learning process. The combination of these two terms promotes the discriminative power of the learned sparse representations and leads to improved classification accuracy. The proposed method was evaluated on several different datasets, representing both single-label and multi-label classification problems, and demonstrated better performance compared with other dictionary based approaches.

##### Abstract (translated by Google)
在本文中，我们提出了一个监督的字典学习算法，旨在保存数据的两个维度的局部几何。基于图的正则化明确地考虑了数据点的局部流形结构。第二个图正则化给出了与特征域类似的处理，并有助于学习更强大的字典。这两个图都可以从训练数据中构建出来，或者沿着字典学习过程学习和调整。这两个术语的组合提高了学习稀疏表示的判别力，并导致分类准确度的提高。所提出的方法在几个不同的数据集上进行了评估，代表单标签和多标签分类问题，并且与其他基于字典的方法相比表现出更好的性能。
