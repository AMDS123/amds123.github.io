##### Abstract
In this work, we tackle the problem of car license plate detection and recognition in natural scene images. We propose a unified deep neural network which can localize license plates and recognize the letters simultaneously in a single forward pass. The whole network can be trained end-to-end. In contrast to existing approaches which take license plate detection and recognition as two separate tasks and settle them step by step, our method jointly solves these two tasks by a single network. It not only avoids intermediate error accumulation, but also accelerates the processing speed. For performance evaluation, three datasets including images captured from various scenes under different conditions are tested. Extensive experiments show the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed approach.

在这项工作中，我们解决了自然场景图像中的车牌检测和识别问题。我们提出了一个统一的深度神经网络，可以在一个正向通道中对车牌进行定位并同时识别字母。整个网络可以进行端到端的培训。与将车牌检测和识别作为两个独立的任务并逐步解决的现有方法相比，我们的方法通过单个网络共同解决这两个任务。它不但避免了中间错误的积累，而且加快了处理速度。对于性能评估，测试了三个数据集，包括在不同条件下从各种场景拍摄的图像。大量的实验表明了我们提出的方法的有效性和有效性。
