##### Abstract
In this work we present a method to train a plane-aware convolutional neural network for dense depth and surface normal estimation as well as plane boundaries from a single indoor \threesixty image. Using our proposed loss function, our network outperforms existing methods for single-view, indoor, omnidirectional depth estimation and provides an initial benchmark for surface normal prediction from \threesixty images. Our improvements are due to the use of a novel plane-aware loss that leverages principal curvature as an indicator of planar boundaries. We also show that including geodesic coordinate maps as network priors provides a significant boost in surface normal prediction accuracy. Finally, we demonstrate how we can combine our network's outputs to generate high quality 3D ``pop-up" models of indoor scenes.
