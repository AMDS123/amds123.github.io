##### Abstract
Unlike previous unknown nouns tagging task (Curran, 2005) (Ciaramita and Johnson, 2003), this is the first attempt to focus on out-of-vocabulary(OOV) lexical evaluation tasks that does not require any prior knowledge. The OOV words are words that only appear in test samples. The goal of tasks is to provide solutions for OOV lexical classification and predication. The tasks require annotators to conclude the attributes of the OOV words based on their related contexts. Then, we utilize unsupervised word embedding methods such as Word2Vec(Mikolov et al., 2013) and Word2GM (Athiwaratkun and Wilson, 2017) to perform the baseline experiments on the categorical classification task and OOV words attribute prediction tasks.
