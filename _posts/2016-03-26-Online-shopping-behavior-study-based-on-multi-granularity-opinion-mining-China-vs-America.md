##### Abstract
With the development of e-commerce, many products are now being sold worldwide, and manufacturers are eager to obtain a better understanding of customer behavior in various regions. To achieve this goal, most previous efforts have focused mainly on questionnaires, which are time-consuming and costly. The tremendous volume of product reviews on e-commerce websites has seen a new trend emerge, whereby manufacturers attempt to understand user preferences by analyzing online reviews. Following this trend, this paper addresses the problem of studying customer behavior by exploiting recently developed opinion mining techniques. This work is novel for three reasons. First, questionnaire-based investigation is automatically enabled by employing algorithms for template-based question generation and opinion mining-based answer extraction. Using this system, manufacturers are able to obtain reports of customer behavior featuring a much larger sample size, more direct information, a higher degree of automation, and a lower cost. Second, international customer behavior study is made easier by integrating tools for multilingual opinion mining. Third, this is the first time an automatic questionnaire investigation has been conducted to compare customer behavior in China and America, where product reviews are written and read in Chinese and English, respectively. Our study on digital cameras, smartphones, and tablet computers yields three findings. First, Chinese customers follow the Doctrine of the Mean, and often use euphemistic expressions, while American customers express their opinions more directly. Second, Chinese customers care more about general feelings, while American customers pay more attention to product details. Third, Chinese customers focus on external features, while American customers care more about the internal features of products.

##### Abstract (translated by Google)
随着电子商务的发展，许多产品正在全球范围内销售，制造商渴望更好地了解各地区的客户行为。为了实现这个目标，以前的大多数工作主要集中在问卷上，这些问题既费时又费钱。电子商务网站上的大量产品评论出现了新趋势，制造商试图通过分析在线评论来了解用户偏好。遵循这一趋势，本文通过利用最近开发的意见挖掘技术来解决研究客户行为的问题。这项工作是新颖的，有三个原因。首先，通过采用基于模板的问题生成和基于意见挖掘的答案提取算法自动启用问卷调查。使用该系统，制造商可以获得更大的样本量，更直接的信息，更高的自动化程度以及更低的成本的客户行为报告。其次，通过整合多语言意见挖掘工具，国际客户行为研究变得更加容易。第三，这是中国和美国客户行为的第一次自动问卷调查，分别用中文和英文书写产品评论。我们对数码相机，智能手机和平板电脑的研究产生了三个结果。首先，中国消费者遵循中庸，经常使用委婉的表达方式，而美国消费者更直接地表达自己的意见。其次，中国客户更关心一般感受，而美国客户更注重产品细节。第三，中国客户关注外部特征，而美国客户更关心产品的内部特征。
