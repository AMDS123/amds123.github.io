##### Abstract
The prevalent scene text detection approach follows four sequential steps comprising character candidate detection, false character candidate removal, text line extraction, and text line verification. However, errors occur and accumulate throughout each of these sequential steps which often lead to low detection performance. To address these issues, we propose a unified scene text detection system, namely Text Flow, by utilizing the minimum cost (min-cost) flow network model. With character candidates detected by cascade boosting, the min-cost flow network model integrates the last three sequential steps into a single process which solves the error accumulation problem at both character level and text line level effectively. The proposed technique has been tested on three public datasets, i.e, ICDAR2011 dataset, ICDAR2013 dataset and a multilingual dataset and it outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on all three datasets with much higher recall and F-score. The good performance on the multilingual dataset shows that the proposed technique can be used for the detection of texts in different languages.

流行的场景文本检测方法遵循四个连续步骤，包括字符候选检测，假字符候选删除，文本行提取和文本行验证。然而，在通常导致低检测性能的这些连续步骤的每一个过程中都会出现错误并累积。为了解决这些问题，我们提出了一个统一的场景文本检测系统，即文本流，利用最低成本（最小成本）流量网络模型。最小代价流网络模型通过级联提升检测字符候选，将最后三个连续步骤集成到一个单独的过程中，有效地解决了字符级别和文本行级别的错误积累问题。所提出的技术已经在三个公共数据集（即ICDAR2011数据集，ICDAR2013数据集和多语言数据集）上进行了测试，并且在所有三个数据集上具有高得多的查全率和F-得分的性能优于最先进的方法。多语言数据集的良好性能表明，所提出的技术可用于不同语言的文本检测。
