##### Abstract
Automated metrics such as BLEU are widely used in the machine translation literature. They have also been used recently in the dialogue community for evaluating dialogue response generation. However, previous work in dialogue response generation has shown that these metrics do not correlate strongly with human judgment in the non task-oriented dialogue setting. Task-oriented dialogue responses are expressed on narrower domains and exhibit lower diversity. It is thus reasonable to think that these automated metrics would correlate well with human judgment in the task-oriented setting where the generation task consists of translating dialogue acts into a sentence. We conduct an empirical study to confirm whether this is the case. Our findings indicate that these automated metrics have stronger correlation with human judgments in the task-oriented setting compared to what has been observed in the non task-oriented setting. We also observe that these metrics correlate even better for datasets which provide multiple ground truth reference sentences. In addition, we show that some of the currently available corpora for task-oriented language generation can be solved with simple models and advocate for more challenging datasets.

诸如BLEU的自动化指标被广泛用于机器翻译文献中。他们最近还被用在对话社区评估对话反应的产生。然而，对话反应生成的先前工作表明，这些指标与非任务导向对话背景下的人为判断并不紧密相关。面向任务的对话反应表现在较狭窄的领域，表现出较低的多样性。因此，在面向任务的环境中，这些自动化的度量标准与人的判断力相关性是合理的，在这种环境下，生成任务包括将对话行为转换成句子。我们进行实证研究来确认是否是这种情况。我们的研究结果表明，这些自动化指标与任务导向设置中的人为判断相比，在非任务导向设置中观察到的更强。我们还观察到，这些度量关联对于提供多个地面真值引用语句的数据集而言甚至更好。另外，我们展示了面向任务的语言生成的一些当前可用的语料库可以用简单的模型来解决，并提倡更具挑战性的数据集。
