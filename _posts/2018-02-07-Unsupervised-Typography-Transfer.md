##### Abstract
Traditional methods in Chinese typography synthesis view characters as an assembly of radicals and strokes, but they rely on manual definition of the key points, which is still time-costing. Some recent work on computer vision proposes a brand new approach: to treat every Chinese character as an independent and inseparable image, so the pre-processing and post-processing of each character can be avoided. Then with a combination of a transfer network and a discriminating network, one typography can be well transferred to another. Despite the quite satisfying performance of the model, the training process requires to be supervised, which means in the training data each character in the source domain and the target domain needs to be perfectly paired. Sometimes the pairing is time-costing, and sometimes there is no perfect pairing, such as the pairing between traditional Chinese and simplified Chinese characters. In this paper, we proposed an unsupervised typography transfer method which doesn't need pairing.

传统方法在汉字排版综合中将字符看作是部首和笔画的集合，但是它们依赖于人工定义关键点，这仍然是时间成本的。最近的一些计算机视觉方面的工作提出了一种全新的方法：把每一个汉字看作是一个独立的，不可分割的图像，这样可以避免每个汉字的预处理和后处理。然后结合一个传输网络和一个识别网络，一个排版可以很好地转移到另一个。尽管模型的性能相当令人满意，但训练过程需要被监督，这意味着在训练数据中，源域和目标域中的每个字符需要完全配对。有时配对是耗费时间的，有时也没有完美的配对，比如中文繁体字和简体字配对。在这篇论文中，我们提出了一种不需要配对的无监督印刷传输方法。
