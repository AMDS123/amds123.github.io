##### Abstract
Word embedding has become a fundamental component to many NLP tasks such as named entity recognition and machine translation. However, popular models that learn such embeddings are unaware of the morphology of words, so it is not directly applicable to highly agglutinative languages such as Korean. We propose a syllable-based learning model for Korean using a convolutional neural network, in which word representation is composed of trained syllable vectors. Our model successfully produces morphologically meaningful representation of Korean words compared to the original Skip-gram embeddings. The results also show that it is quite robust to the Out-of-Vocabulary problem.

词嵌入已成为许多NLP任务的基本组成部分，如命名实体识别和机器翻译。然而，学习这种嵌入的流行模型不了解词的形态，所以不能直接应用于诸如韩语的高度粘着的语言。我们使用卷积神经网络为韩语提出了一个基于音节的学习模型，其中词汇表达由训练的音节向量组成。与原始的Skip-gram嵌入相比，我们的模型成功地生成了形态上有意义的韩文单词表示。结果还表明，这对于词汇量不足的问题是相当有力的。
