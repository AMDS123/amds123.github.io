##### Abstract
Plane model extraction from three-dimensional point clouds is a necessary step in many different applications such as planar object reconstruction, indoor mapping and indoor localization. Different RANdom SAmple Consensus (RANSAC)-based methods have been proposed for this purpose in recent years. In this study, we propose a novel method-based on RANSAC called Multiplane Model Estimation, which can estimate multiple plane models simultaneously from a noisy point cloud using the knowledge extracted from a scene (or an object) in order to reconstruct it accurately. This method comprises two steps: first, it clusters the data into planar faces that preserve some constraints defined by knowledge related to the object (e.g., the angles between faces); and second, the models of the planes are estimated based on these data using a novel multi-constraint RANSAC. We performed experiments in the clustering and RANSAC stages, which showed that the proposed method performed better than state-of-the-art methods.

三维点云的平面模型提取是平面目标重建，室内测绘和室内定位等许多不同应用的必要步骤。近年来已经为此提出了不同的基于RANAC的RANSAC（RANSAC）共识（RANSAC）方法。在这项研究中，我们提出了一种基于RANSAC的新方法 - 多平面模型估计（Multiplane Model Estimation），它可以利用从一个场景（或一个物体）中提取的知识从一个有噪点云同时估计多平面模型，以便准确地重建它。该方法包括两个步骤：首先，将数据聚类成平面，以保留由与对象有关的知识（例如，面之间的角度）定义的一些约束;其次，使用新的多约束RANSAC基于这些数据来估计平面的模型。我们在聚类和RANSAC阶段进行了实验，表明所提出的方法比现有技术方法表现更好。
