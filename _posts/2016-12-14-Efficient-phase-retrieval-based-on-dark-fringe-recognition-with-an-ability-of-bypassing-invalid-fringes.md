##### Abstract
This paper discusses the noisy phase retrieval problem: recovering a complex image signal with independent noise from quadratic measurements. Inspired by the dark fringes shown in the measured images of the array detector, a novel phase retrieval approach is proposed and demonstrated both theoretically and experimentally to recognize the dark fringes and bypass the invalid fringes. A more accurate relative phase ratio between arbitrary two pixels is achieved by calculating the multiplicative ratios (or the sum of phase difference) on the path between them. Then the object phase image can be reconstructed precisely. Our approach is a good choice for retrieving high-quality phase images from noisy signals and has many potential applications in the fields such as X-ray crystallography, diffractive imaging, and so on.

本文讨论了噪声相位恢复问题：从二次测量中恢复具有独立噪声的复杂图像信号。受到阵列探测器测量图像中黑暗条纹的启发，提出了一种新的相位恢复方法，并在理论和实验上证明了识别暗条纹和绕过无效条纹。通过计算它们之间的路径上的乘法比率（或相位差的和）来获得任意两个像素之间的更精确的相对相位比率。然后可以精确地重建物体相位图像。我们的方法是从噪声信号中提取高质量相位图像的一种很好的选择，在X射线晶体学，衍射成像等领域有着广泛的应用前景。
