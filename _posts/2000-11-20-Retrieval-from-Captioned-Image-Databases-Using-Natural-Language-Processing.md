##### Abstract
It might appear that natural language processing should improve the accuracy of information retrieval systems, by making available a more detailed analysis of queries and documents. Although past results appear to show that this is not so, if the focus is shifted to short phrases rather than full documents, the situation becomes somewhat different. The ANVIL system uses a natural language technique to obtain high accuracy retrieval of images which have been annotated with a descriptive textual caption. The natural language techniques also allow additional contextual information to be derived from the relation between the query and the caption, which can help users to understand the overall collection of retrieval results. The techniques have been successfully used in a information retrieval system which forms both a testbed for research and the basis of a commercial system.

自然语言处理似乎应该通过对查询和文档进行更详细的分析来提高信息检索系统的准确性。尽管过去的结果似乎表明情况并非如此，但如果把重点转移到短语而不是完整的文件上，情况会有所不同。 ANVIL系统使用自然语言技术来获得用描述性文本标题注释的图像的高精度检索。自然语言技术还允许从查询和标题之间的关系中获得附加的上下文信息，这可以帮助用户理解检索结果的总体集合。这些技术已经成功地用于一个信息检索系统，它既是研究的试验台，又是商业系统的基础。
