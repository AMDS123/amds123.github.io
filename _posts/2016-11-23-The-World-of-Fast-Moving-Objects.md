##### Abstract
The notion of a Fast Moving Object (FMO), i.e. an object that moves over a distance exceeding its size within the exposure time, is introduced. FMOs may, and typically do, rotate with high angular speed. FMOs are very common in sports videos, but are not rare elsewhere. In a single frame, such objects are often barely visible and appear as semi-transparent streaks. A method for the detection and tracking of FMOs is proposed. The method consists of three distinct algorithms, which form an efficient localization pipeline that operates successfully in a broad range of conditions. We show that it is possible to recover the appearance of the object and its axis of rotation, despite its blurred appearance. The proposed method is evaluated on a new annotated dataset. The results show that existing trackers are inadequate for the problem of FMO localization and a new approach is required. Two applications of localization, temporal super-resolution and highlighting, are presented.

##### Abstract (translated by Google)
引入了快速移动物体（FMO）的概念，即在曝光时间内移动超过其尺寸的距离的物体。 FMO可能并且通常以高角速度旋转。 FMO在运动视频中非常普遍，但在其他地方并不罕见。在一个单一的框架中，这样的对象通常几乎不可见，并显示为半透明的条纹。提出了一种检测和跟踪FMO的方法。该方法由三种不同的算法组成，这些算法形成了一个高效的本地化管道，可以在广泛的条件下成功运行。我们表明，尽管模糊的外观，它可以恢复对象的外观和旋转轴。所提出的方法在新的注释数据集上进行评估。结果表明，现有的跟踪器不足以解决FMO定位问题，需要采用新的方法。介绍了两个本地化，时间超分辨率和突出显示的应用。
