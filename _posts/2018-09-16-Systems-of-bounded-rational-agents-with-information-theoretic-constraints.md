##### Abstract
Specialization and hierarchical organization are important features of efficient collaboration in economical, artificial, and biological systems. Here, we investigate the hypothesis that both features can be explained by the fact that each entity of such a system is limited in a certain way. We propose an information-theoretic approach based on a Free Energy principle, in order to computationally analyze systems of bounded rational agents that deal with such limitations optimally. We find that specialization allows to focus on fewer tasks, thus leading to a more efficient execution, but in turn requires coordination in hierarchical structures of specialized experts and coordinating units. Our results suggest that hierarchical architectures of specialized units at lower levels that are coordinated by units at higher levels are optimal, given that each unit's information-processing capability is limited and conforms to constraints on complexity costs.

专业化和等级组织是经济，人工和生物系统中有效协作的重要特征。在这里，我们研究这样的假设，即这两个特征可以通过这样一个系统的每个实体以某种方式受到限制的事实来解释。我们提出了一种基于自由能原理的信息理论方法，以便计算分析有限理性代理的系统，以最佳地处理这些限制。我们发现专业化允许专注于更少的任务，从而导致更高效的执行，但反过来又需要在专业专家和协调单位的层级结构中进行协调。我们的结果表明，由于每个单元的信息处理能力有限并且符合复杂性成本的约束，因此在较低级别由较高级别的单元协调的专用单元的分层架构是最佳的。
