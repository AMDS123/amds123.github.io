##### Abstract
Customized grippers have broad applications in industrial assembly lines. Compared with general parallel grippers, the customized grippers have specifically designed fingers to increase the contact area with the workpieces and improve the grasp robustness. However, grasp planning for customized grippers is challenging due to the object variations, surface contacts and structural constraints of the grippers. In this paper, an iterative surface fitting (ISF) algorithm is proposed to plan grasps for customized grippers. ISF simultaneously searches for optimal gripper transformation and finger displacement by minimizing the surface fitting error. A guided sampling is introduced to avoid ISF getting stuck in local optima and improve the collision avoidance performance. The proposed algorithm is able to consider the structural constraints of the gripper, such as the range of jaw width, and plan optimal grasps in real-time. The effectiveness of the algorithm is verified by both simulations and experiments.

定制抓手在工业装配线中有广泛的应用。与一般平行夹具相比，定制夹具具有专门设计的手指，以增加与工件的接触面积，并提高抓牢度。然而，由于物体的变化，表面接触和夹具的结构限制，掌握定制夹具的规划是具有挑战性的。在本文中，提出了一种迭代曲面拟合（ISF）算法来规划定制抓手的抓握。 ISF同时通过最小化表面拟合误差来寻找最佳的抓手变换和手指位移。引入指导性抽样以避免ISF陷入局部最优，并提高防撞性能。该算法能够考虑抓爪的结构约束，如颚宽的范围，并实时计划最优抓取。该算法的有效性通过模拟和实验进行验证。
