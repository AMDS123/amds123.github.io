##### Abstract
Interpretability has emerged as a crucial aspect of machine learning, aimed at providing insights into the working of complex neural networks. However, existing solutions vary vastly based on the nature of the interpretability task, with each use case requiring substantial time and effort. This paper introduces MARGIN, a simple yet general approach to address a large set of interpretability tasks ranging from identifying prototypes to explaining image predictions. MARGIN exploits ideas rooted in graph signal analysis to determine influential nodes in a graph, which are defined as those nodes that maximally describe a function defined on the graph. By carefully defining task-specific graphs and functions, we demonstrate that MARGIN outperforms existing approaches in a number of disparate interpretability challenges.
