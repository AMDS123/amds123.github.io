##### Abstract
Reinforcement Learning (RL) has brought forth ideas of autonomous robots that can navigate real-world environments with ease, aiding humans in a variety of tasks. RL agents have just begun to make their way out of simulation into the real world. Once in the real world, benchmark tasks often fail to transfer into useful skills. We introduce DoorGym, a simulation environment intended to be the first step to move RL from toy environments towards useful atomic skills that can be composed and extended towards a broader goal. DoorGym is an open-source door simulation framework designed to be highly configurable. We also provide a baseline PPO (Proximal Policy Optimization) and SAC (Soft Actor-Critic)implementation, which achieves a success rate of up to 70% for common tasks in this environment.
