##### Abstract
Under the project Maccoy Critical, we would like to train individuals, in virtual environments, to handle critical situations such as dilemmas. These latter refer to situations where there is no ``good'' solution. In other words, situations that lead to negative consequences whichever choice is made. Our objective is to use Knowledge Models to extract necessary properties for dilemmas to emerge. To do so, our approach consists in developing a Scenario Orchestration System that generates dilemma situations dynamically without having to write them beforehand. In this paper we present this approach and expose a proof of concept of the generation process.
