##### Abstract
While liking or upvoting a post on a mobile app is easy to do, replying with a written note is much more difficult, due to both the cognitive load of coming up with a meaningful response as well as the mechanics of entering the text. Here we present a novel textual reply generation model that goes beyond the current auto-reply and predictive text entry models by taking into account the content preferences of the user, the idiosyncrasies of their conversational style, and even the structure of their social graph. Specifically, we have developed two types of models for personalized user interactions: a content-based conversation model, which makes use of location together with user information, and a social-graph-based conversation model, which combines content-based conversation models with social graphs.

虽然在移动应用程序上喜欢或提出一个帖子很容易做到，但由于认知负担会产生一个有意义的回应以及输入文本的机制，所以用书面回复来回答要困难得多。在这里，我们提出了一种新颖的文本回复生成模型，通过考虑用户的内容偏好，对话风格的特质，甚至他们的社交图的结构，超越了当前的自动回复和预测文本输入模型。具体来说，我们已经开发了两种用于个性化用户交互的模型：基于内容的对话模型，其将位置与用户信息一起使用;以及基于社交图的对话模型，其将基于内容的对话模型与社交图表。
