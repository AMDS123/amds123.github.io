##### Abstract
ConArg is a suite of tools that offers a wide series of applications for dealing with argumentation problems. In this work, we present the advances we made in implementing a ranking-based semantics, based on computational choice power indexes, within ConArg. Such kind of semantics represents a method for sorting the arguments of an abstract argumentation framework, according to some preference relation. The ranking-based semantics we implement relies on Shapley, Banzhaf, Deegan-Packel and Johnston power index, transferring well know properties from computational social choice to argumentation framework ranking-based semantics.
