##### Abstract
A non-invasive method for the monitoring of heart activity can help to reduce the deaths caused by heart disorders such as stroke, arrhythmia and heart attack. The human voice can be considered as a biometric data that can be used for estimation of heart rate. In this paper, we propose a method for estimating the heart rate from human speech dynamically using voice signal analysis and by the development of an empirical linear predictor model. The correlation between the voice signal and heart rate are established by classifiers and prediction of the heart rates with or without emotions are done using linear models. The prediction accuracy was tested using the data collected from 15 subjects, it is about 4050 samples of speech signals and corresponding electrocardiogram samples. The proposed approach can use for early non-invasive detection of heart rate changes that can be correlated to an emotional state of the individual and also can be used as a tool for diagnosis of heart conditions in real-time situations.

监测心脏活动的非侵入性方法有助于减少心脏疾病如中风，心律失常和心脏病发作引起的死亡。人声可被认为是可用于心率估计的生物测量数据。在本文中，我们提出了一种用语音信号分析和经验线性预测模型的发展来动态估计人类语音的心率的方法。语音信号和心率之间的相关性通过分类器来建立，并且使用线性模型来预测有或无情绪的心率。使用从15个受试者收集的数据测试预测准确度，约4050个样本的语音信号和相应的心电图样本。所提出的方法可以用于早期无创检测可以与个体的情绪状态相关的心率变化，并且还可以用作实时情况下的心脏状况诊断工具。
