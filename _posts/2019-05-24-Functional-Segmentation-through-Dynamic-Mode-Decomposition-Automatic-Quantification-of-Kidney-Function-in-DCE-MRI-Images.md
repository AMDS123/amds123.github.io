##### Abstract
Quantification of kidney function in Dynamic Contrast-Enhanced Magnetic Resonance Imaging (DCE-MRI) requires careful segmentation of the renal region of interest (ROI). Traditionally, human experts are required to manually delineate the kidney ROI across multiple images in the dynamic sequence. This approach is costly, time-consuming and labour intensive, and therefore acts to limit patient throughout and acts as one of the factors limiting the wider adoption of DCR-MRI in clinical practice. Therefore, to address this issue, we present the first use of Dynamic Mode Decomposition (DMD) as a basis for automatic segmentation of a dynamic sequence, in this case, kidney ROIs in DCE-MRI. Using DMD coupled combined with thresholding and connected component analysis is first validated on synthetically generated data with known ground-truth, and then applied to ten healthy volunteers' DCE-MRI datasets. We find that the segmentation result obtained from our proposed DMD framework is comparable to that of expert observers and very significantly better than that of an a-priori bounding box segmentation. Our result gives a mean Jaccard coefficient of 0.87, compared to mean scores of 0.85, 0.88 and 0.87 produced from three independent manual annotations. This represents the first use of DMD as a robust automatic data-driven segmentation approach without requiring any human intervention. This is a viable, efficient alternative approach to current manual methods of isolation of kidney function in DCE-MRI.
