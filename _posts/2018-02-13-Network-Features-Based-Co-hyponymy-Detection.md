##### Abstract
Distinguishing lexical relations has been a long term pursuit in natural language processing (NLP) domain. Recently, in order to detect lexical relations like hypernymy, meronymy, co-hyponymy etc., distributional semantic models are being used extensively in some form or the other. Even though a lot of efforts have been made for detecting hypernymy relation, the problem of co-hyponymy detection has been rarely investigated. In this paper, we are proposing a novel supervised model where various network measures have been utilized to identify co-hyponymy relation with high accuracy performing better or at par with the state-of-the-art models.

##### Abstract (translated by Google)
区分词汇关系一直是自然语言处理（NLP）领域的长期追求。最近，为了检测词汇关系，如超句法，主元分析，联合语义学等，分布式语义模型被广泛地以某种形式或另一种形式使用。尽管已经做了很多努力来检测超上关系，但共同的下位检测问题很少被研究。在本文中，我们提出了一种新的监督模型，其中采用了各种网络测量方法来识别高精度的联合地名关系，并且与最先进的模型相比具有更好的表现。
