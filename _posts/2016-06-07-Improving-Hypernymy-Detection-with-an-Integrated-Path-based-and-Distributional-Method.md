##### Abstract
Detecting hypernymy relations is a key task in NLP, which is addressed in the literature using two complementary approaches. Distributional methods, whose supervised variants are the current best performers, and path-based methods, which received less research attention. We suggest an improved path-based algorithm, in which the dependency paths are encoded using a recurrent neural network, that achieves results comparable to distributional methods. We then extend the approach to integrate both path-based and distributional signals, significantly improving upon the state-of-the-art on this task.

##### Abstract (translated by Google)
检测上下文关系是NLP中的关键任务，这在文献中使用两种补充方法来解决。分配方法，其监督变种是当前最好的表现者和基于路径的方法，这些方法受到的研究关注度较低。我们建议一种改进的基于路径的算法，其中依赖路径使用递归神经网络进行编码，实现与分布方法相当的结果。然后，我们扩展了整合基于路径和分布信号的方法，显着改善了这项任务的最新技术水平。
