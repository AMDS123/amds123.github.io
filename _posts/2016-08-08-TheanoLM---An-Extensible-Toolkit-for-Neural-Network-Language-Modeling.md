##### Abstract
We present a new tool for training neural network language models (NNLMs), scoring sentences, and generating text. The tool has been written using Python library Theano, which allows researcher to easily extend it and tune any aspect of the training process. Regardless of the flexibility, Theano is able to generate extremely fast native code that can utilize a GPU or multiple CPU cores in order to parallelize the heavy numerical computations. The tool has been evaluated in difficult Finnish and English conversational speech recognition tasks, and significant improvement was obtained over our best back-off n-gram models. The results that we obtained in the Finnish task were compared to those from existing RNNLM and RWTHLM toolkits, and found to be as good or better, while training times were an order of magnitude shorter.

我们提供了一个新的工具来训练神经网络语言模型（NNLMs），评分句子和生成文本。该工具是使用Python库Theano编写的，它允许研究人员轻松地扩展和调整培训过程的任何方面。无论灵活性如何，Theano都能够生成速度非常快的本机代码，可以利用GPU或多个CPU内核来并行化大量的数值计算。该工具已经在芬兰语和英语对话式语音识别任务中进行了评估，并且在我们最好的后退n-gram模型上获得了显着的改进。我们在芬兰任务中得到的结果与现有的RNNLM和RWTHLM工具包的结果进行了比较，发现结果一样好或者更好，而训练时间则缩短了一个数量级。
