##### Abstract
Open Information Extraction (Open IE) systems aim to obtain relation tuples with highly scalable extraction in portable across domain by identifying a variety of relation phrases and their arguments in arbitrary sentences. The first generation of Open IE learns linear chain models based on unlexicalized features such as Part-of-Speech (POS) or shallow tags to label the intermediate words between pair of potential arguments for identifying extractable relations. Open IE currently is developed in the second generation that is able to extract instances of the most frequently observed relation types such as Verb, Noun and Prep, Verb and Prep, and Infinitive with deep linguistic analysis. They expose simple yet principled ways in which verbs express relationships in linguistics such as verb phrase-based extraction or clause-based extraction. They obtain a significantly higher performance over previous systems in the first generation. In this paper, we describe an overview of two Open IE generations including strengths, weaknesses and application areas.

##### Abstract (translated by Google)
开放信息抽取（Open Information Extraction，Open IE）系统旨在通过在任意句子中识别各种关系短语及其参数，获得便携式跨域的高度可伸缩抽取的关系元组。第一代Open IE学习基于非语义化特征的线性链模型，例如词性（POS）或浅标签来标记用于识别可抽取关系的一对潜在参数之间的中间词。目前开放的IE是在第二代开发的，能够提取最常见的关系类型的例子，如动词，名词和准备，动词和准备，不定式和深层语言分析。他们揭示了简单而有原则的方式，动词表达动词短语提取或基于条件的提取等语言学中的关系。在第一代中，它们比以前的系统获得了更高的性能。在本文中，我们描述了两个Open IE世代的概况，包括优势，劣势和应用领域。
