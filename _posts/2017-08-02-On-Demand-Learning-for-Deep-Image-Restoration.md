##### Abstract
While machine learning approaches to image restoration offer great promise, current methods risk training models fixated on performing well only for image corruption of a particular level of difficulty---such as a certain level of noise or blur. First, we examine the weakness of conventional "fixated" models and demonstrate that training general models to handle arbitrary levels of corruption is indeed non-trivial. Then, we propose an on-demand learning algorithm for training image restoration models with deep convolutional neural networks. The main idea is to exploit a feedback mechanism to self-generate training instances where they are needed most, thereby learning models that can generalize across difficulty levels. On four restoration tasks---image inpainting, pixel interpolation, image deblurring, and image denoising---and three diverse datasets, our approach consistently outperforms both the status quo training procedure and curriculum learning alternatives.

虽然机器学习方法对图像恢复提供了很大的希望，但是目前的方法冒险训练模型只能针对特定难度级别的图像损坏 - 例如一定程度的噪声或模糊 - 而表现良好。首先，我们考察传统“固定”模式的弱点，并证明培养一般模型来处理任意的腐败程度确实是不平凡的。然后，我们提出了一种用于深度卷积神经网络训练图像恢复模型的按需学习算法。其主要思想是利用反馈机制自行生成最需要的培训实例，从而学习可以推广到不同难度级别的模型。对于图像修复，像素插值，图像去模糊和图像去噪等四个修复任务以及三个不同的数据集，我们的方法始终优于现状培训程序和课程学习方法。
