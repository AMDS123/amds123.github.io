##### Abstract
In multiagent environments, the capability of learning is important for an agent to behave appropriately in face of unknown opponents and dynamic environment. From the system designer's perspective, it is desirable if the agents can learn to coordinate towards socially optimal outcomes, while also avoiding being exploited by selfish opponents. To this end, we propose a novel gradient ascent based algorithm (SA-IGA) which augments the basic gradient-ascent algorithm by incorporating social awareness into the policy update process. We theoretically analyze the learning dynamics of SA-IGA using dynamical system theory and SA-IGA is shown to have linear dynamics for a wide range of games including symmetric games. The learning dynamics of two representative games (the prisoner's dilemma game and the coordination game) are analyzed in details. Based on the idea of SA-IGA, we further propose a practical multiagent learning algorithm, called SA-PGA, based on Q-learning update rule. Simulation results show that SA-PGA agent can achieve higher social welfare than previous social-optimality oriented Conditional Joint Action Learner (CJAL) and also is robust against individually rational opponents by reaching Nash equilibrium solutions.

在多代理环境中，学习者的能力对于代理人在面对未知对手和动态环境时表现得恰到好处而言非常重要。从系统设计师的角度来看，如果代理人能够学会协调实现社会最优结果，同时也避免被自私的对手所利用，这是可取的。为此，我们提出了一种新的基于梯度上升的算法（SA-IGA），它通过将社会意识纳入策略更新过程来增强基本梯度上升算法。我们使用动力学系统理论从理论上分析SA-IGA的学习动态，并且SA-IGA被证明对包括对称游戏在内的各种游戏具有线性动态。详细分析了两种代表性游戏（囚徒困境博弈和协调博弈）的学习动态。基于SA-IGA的思想，我们进一步提出了一种基于Q学习更新规则的实用多智能体学习算法SA-PGA。仿真结果表明，SA-PGA智能体可以获得比之前基于社会最优性的条件联合行动学习者（CJAL）更高的社会福利，并且通过达成纳什均衡解决方案对个体理性对手也具有较强的鲁棒性。
