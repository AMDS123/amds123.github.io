##### Abstract
In this paper we explore the application of methods for classical judgment aggregation in pooling probabilistic opinions on logically related issues. For this reason, we first modify the Boolean judgment aggregation framework in the way that allows handling probabilistic judgments and then define probabilistic aggregation functions obtained by generalization of the classical ones. In addition, we discuss essential desirable properties for the aggregation functions and explore impossibility results.
