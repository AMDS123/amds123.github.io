##### Abstract
Liveliness detection acts as a safe guard against spoofing attacks. Most of the researchers used vision based techniques to detect liveliness of the user, but they are highly sensitive to illumination effects. Therefore it is very hard to design a system, which will work robustly under all circumstances. Literature shows that most of the research utilize eye blink or mouth movement to detect the liveliness, while the other group used face texture to distinguish between real and imposter. The classification results of all these approaches decreases drastically in variable light conditions. Hence in this paper we are introducing fuzzy expert system which is sufficient enough to handle most of the cases comes in real time. We have used two testing parameters, (a) under bad illumination and (b) less movement in eyes and mouth in case of real user to evaluate the performance of the system. The system is behaving well in all, while in first case its False Rejection Rate (FRR) is 0.28, and in second case its FRR is 0.4.

生动性检测是防止欺骗攻击的安全措施。大多数研究人员使用基于视觉的技术来检测用户的活跃度，但是他们对照明效果高度敏感。因此设计一个系统是非常困难的，这个系统在任何情况下都会运行稳定。文献表明，大多数研究利用眨眼或嘴巴运动来检测生动活泼，而另一组利用脸部纹理区分真实和冒名顶替。所有这些方法的分类结果在可变光照条件下急剧下降。因此，在本文中，我们介绍了模糊专家系统，足以处理大多数情况下实时。我们已经使用了两个测试参数，（a）在不良照明下和（b）在真实用户的情况下在眼睛和嘴巴中移动较少以评估系统的性能。该系统表现良好，而第一种情况下的拒绝率（FRR）为0.28，第二种情况下的FRR为0.4。
