##### Abstract
We introduce a corpus of 7,032 sentences rated by human annotators for formality, informativeness, and implicature on a 1-7 scale. The corpus was annotated using Amazon Mechanical Turk. Reliability in the obtained judgments was examined by comparing mean ratings across two MTurk experiments, and correlation with pilot annotations (on sentence formality) conducted in a more controlled setting. Despite the subjectivity and inherent difficulty of the annotation task, correlations between mean ratings were quite encouraging, especially on formality and informativeness. We further explored correlation between the three linguistic variables, genre-wise variation of ratings and correlations within genres, compatibility with automatic stylistic scoring, and sentential make-up of a document in terms of style. To date, our corpus is the largest sentence-level annotated corpus released for formality, informativeness, and implicature.

##### Abstract (translated by Google)
我们引入一个由人类注释者评定的7032个句子的语料库，用于形式，信息量和1-7级的含义。该语料库使用Amazon Mechanical Turk注释。所得判断的可靠性通过比较两个MTurk实验的平均评分，以及在更受控制的环境中进行的试点注释（在句子形式上）的相关性来检验。尽管注释任务的主观性和固有的困难，平均评分之间的相关性是相当令人鼓舞的，尤其是形式性和信息性。我们进一步探讨了三种语言变量之间的相关性，流派内部流派的类型变化和流派内部的相关性，与自动文体评分的兼容性以及文体的文体构成。到目前为止，我们的语料库是形式性，信息性和隐含性最大的句子级注释语料库。
