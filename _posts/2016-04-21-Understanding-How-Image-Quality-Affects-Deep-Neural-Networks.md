##### Abstract
Image quality is an important practical challenge that is often overlooked in the design of machine vision systems. Commonly, machine vision systems are trained and tested on high quality image datasets, yet in practical applications the input images can not be assumed to be of high quality. Recently, deep neural networks have obtained state-of-the-art performance on many machine vision tasks. In this paper we provide an evaluation of 4 state-of-the-art deep neural network models for image classification under quality distortions. We consider five types of quality distortions: blur, noise, contrast, JPEG, and JPEG2000 compression. We show that the existing networks are susceptible to these quality distortions, particularly to blur and noise. These results enable future work in developing deep neural networks that are more invariant to quality distortions.

图像质量是机器视觉系统设计中经常忽略的一个重要的实际挑战。通常，机器视觉系统在高质量的图像数据集上进行训练和测试，但在实际应用中，输入图像不能被认为是高质量的。最近，深度神经网络已经在许多机器视觉任务上获得了最先进的性能。在本文中，我们提供了4个质量失真下图像分类的最新深度神经网络模型的评估。我们考虑五种类型的质量失真：模糊，噪声，对比度，JPEG和JPEG2000压缩。我们表明，现有的网络容易受到这些质量的扭曲，特别是模糊和噪音。这些结果使未来能够开发对质量失真更不变的深层神经网络。
