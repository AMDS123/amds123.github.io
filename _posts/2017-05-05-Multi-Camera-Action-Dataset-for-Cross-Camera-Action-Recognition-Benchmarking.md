##### Abstract
Action recognition has received increasing attention from the computer vision and machine learning communities in the last decade. To enable the study of this problem, there exist a vast number of action datasets, which are recorded under controlled laboratory settings, real-world surveillance environments, or crawled from the Internet. Apart from the "in-the-wild" datasets, the training and test split of conventional datasets often possess similar environments conditions, which leads to close to perfect performance on constrained datasets. In this paper, we introduce a new dataset, namely Multi-Camera Action Dataset (MCAD), which is designed to evaluate the open view classification problem under the surveillance environment. In total, MCAD contains 14,298 action samples from 18 action categories, which are performed by 20 subjects and independently recorded with 5 cameras. Inspired by the well received evaluation approach on the LFW dataset, we designed a standard evaluation protocol and benchmarked MCAD under several scenarios. The benchmark shows that while an average of 85% accuracy is achieved under the closed-view scenario, the performance suffers from a significant drop under the cross-view scenario. In the worst case scenario, the performance of 10-fold cross validation drops from 87.0% to 47.4%.

近十年来，行为识别越来越受到计算机视觉和机器学习界的关注。为了研究这个问题，存在大量的操作数据集，这些数据集被记录在受控的实验室设置，真实世界的监视环境中，或者从互联网上爬取。除了“野外”数据集外，传统数据集的训练和测试分割通常具有相似的环境条件，这导致在约束数据集上接近完美的性能。在本文中，我们引入了一个新的数据集，即多摄像机动作数据集（MCAD），该数据集旨在评估监视环境下的开放视图分类问题。 MCAD总共包含来自18个行动类别的14,298个行动样本，由20个主题执行并独立记录5个相机。受到在LFW数据集中广受欢迎的评估方法的启发，我们设计了一个标准评估协议，并在几种情况下对MCAD进行了基准测试。基准测试显示，虽然在闭路情景下平均达到85％的准确率，但是在交叉情景下，性能却大幅下降。在最坏的情况下，10倍交叉验证的性能从87.0％下降到47.4％。
