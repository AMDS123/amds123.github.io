##### Abstract
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) were recently shown to provide state-of-the-art results for object category viewpoint estimation. However different ways of formulating this problem have been proposed and the competing approaches have been explored with very different design choices. This paper presents a comparison of these approaches in a unified setting as well as a detailed analysis of the key factors that impact performance. Followingly, we present a new joint training method with the detection task and demonstrate its benefit. We also highlight the superiority of classification approaches over regression approaches, quantify the benefits of deeper architectures and extended training data, and demonstrate that synthetic data is beneficial even when using ImageNet training data. By combining all these elements, we demonstrate an improvement of approximately 5% mAVP over previous state-of-the-art results on the Pascal3D+ dataset. In particular for their most challenging 24 view classification task we improve the results from 31.1% to 36.1% mAVP.

卷积神经网络（CNN）最近被证明能够为对象类别视点估计提供最新的结果。然而，提出了不同的方式来制定这个问题，并且已经用非常不同的设计选择探索了相互竞争的方法。本文介绍了这些方法在统一环境下的比较，以及对影响性能的关键因素的详细分析。接下来，我们提出了一种新的联合训练方法和检测任务，并展示它的好处。我们还强调了分类方法优于回归方法，量化更深层架构和扩展训练数据的好处，并证明即使使用ImageNet训练数据，合成数据也是有益的。通过结合所有这些元素，我们证明了相对于Pascal3D +数据集上先前的最新结果，约5％mAVP的改进。特别是对于他们最具挑战性的24视图分类任务，我们将结果从31.1％改进为36.1％mAVP。
