##### Abstract
Currently, Segmentation of bitewing radiograpy images is a very challenging task. The focus of the study is to segment it into caries, enamel, dentin, pulp, crowns, restoration and root canal treatments. The main method of semantic segmentation of bitewing radiograpy images at this stage is the U-shaped deep convolution neural network, but its accuracy is low. in order to improve the accuracy of semantic segmentation of bitewing radiograpy images, this paper proposes the use of Conditional Generative Adversarial network (cGAN) combined with U-shaped network structure (U-Net) approach to semantic segmentation of bitewing radiograpy images. The experimental results show that the accuracy of cGAN combined with U-Net is 69.7%, which is 13.3% higher than the accuracy of u-shaped deep convolution neural network of 56.4%.

目前，bitewing射线图像的分割是一个非常具有挑战性的任务。研究的重点是将其分为龋齿，牙釉质，牙本质，牙髓，牙冠，修复体和根管治疗。目前咬合线成像图像语义分割的主要方法是U形深度卷积神经网络，但其准确率较低。为提高咬合线成像图像的语义分割准确率，提出了利用条件生成对抗网络（cGAN）与U形网络结构（U-Net）方法对咬合线成像图像进行语义分割。实验结果表明，cGAN与U-Net相结合的精度为69.7％，比U形深度卷积神经网络的精度高出56.4％，高出13.3％。
