##### Abstract
In this Letter we supervisedly train neural networks to distinguish different topological phases in the context of topological band insulators. After training with Hamiltonians of one-dimensional insulators with chiral symmetry, the neural network can predict their topological winding numbers with nearly 100% accuracy, even for Hamiltonians with larger winding numbers that are not included in the training data. These results show a remarkable success that the neural network can capture the global and nonlinear topological features of quantum phases from local inputs. By opening up the neural network, we confirm that the network does learn the discrete version of the winding number formula. We also make a couple of remarks regarding the role of the symmetry and the opposite effect of regularization techniques when applying machine learning to physical systems.

在这封信中，我们监督地训练神经网络以区分拓扑频带绝缘体的不同拓扑阶段。在用哈密尔顿函数训练具有手征对称性的一维绝缘体之后，即使对于训练数据中未包含较大匝数的哈密尔顿函数，神经网络也能以接近100％的准确度预测其拓扑匝数。这些结果表明，神经网络可以从局部输入中捕获量子相位的全局和非线性拓扑特征，这是一个显着的成功。通过开放神经网络，我们确认网络确实学习了绕组编号公式的离散版本。在将机器学习应用于物理系统时，我们还会就正则化技术的对称性和相反效果发表几点看法。
