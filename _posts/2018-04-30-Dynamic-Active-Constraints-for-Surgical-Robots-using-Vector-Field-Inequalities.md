##### Abstract
Robotic assistance allows surgeons to perform dexterous and tremor-free procedures, but robotic aid is still underrepresented in procedures with constrained workspaces, such as deep brain neurosurgery and endonasal surgery. In those, surgeons have restricted vision to areas near the surgical tool tips, which increases the risk of unexpected collisions between the shafts of the instruments and their surroundings, in special when those parts are outside the surgical field-of-view. Dynamic active constraints can be used to prevent collisions between moving instruments and prevent damage to static or moving tissues. In this work, our vector field inequality method is extended to provide dynamic active constraints to any number of robots and moving objects sharing the same workspace. The method is evaluated in experiments and simulations in which the robot tools have to avoid collisions, autonomously and in real-time, with a constrained endonasal surgical environment and between each other. Results show that both manipulator-manipulator and manipulator-boundary collisions can be effectively prevented using the vector field inequalities.

机器人辅助可以使外科医生执行灵巧和无颤动的手术，但机器人辅助手术在工作空间受限的手术中仍然不足，例如深度脑神经外科手术和鼻内手术。在那些手术中，外科医生将视力限制在手术工具尖端附近的区域，这增加了器械的轴与其周围之间意外碰撞的风险，特别是当这些部分在手术视野外时。动态主动约束可用于防止移动仪器之间的碰撞，并防止静态或移动组织的损坏。在这项工作中，我们的矢量场不等式方法被扩展为为任何数量的共享相同工作空间的机器人和移动物体提供动态主动约束。该方法在实验和模拟中进行评估，其中机器人工具必须避免碰撞，自主地和实时地使用受限制的鼻内手术环境以及彼此之间的碰撞。结果表明，使用矢量场不等式可以有效地防止机械手和机械手边界碰撞。
