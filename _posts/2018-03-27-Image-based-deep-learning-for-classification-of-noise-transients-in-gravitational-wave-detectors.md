##### Abstract
The detection of gravitational waves has inaugurated the era of gravitational astronomy and opened new avenues for the multimessenger study of cosmic sources. Thanks to their sensitivity, the Advanced LIGO and Advanced Virgo interferometers will probe a much larger volume of space and expand the capability of discovering new gravitational wave emitters. The characterization of these detectors is a primary task in order to recognize the main sources of noise and optimize the sensitivity of interferometers. Glitches are transient noise events that can impact the data quality of the interferometers and their classification is an important task for detector characterization. Deep learning techniques are a promising tool for the recognition and classification of glitches. We present a classification pipeline that exploits convolutional neural networks to classify glitches starting from their time-frequency evolution represented as images. We evaluated the classification accuracy on simulated glitches, showing that the proposed algorithm can automatically classify glitches on very fast timescales and with high accuracy, thus providing a promising tool for online detector characterization.

引力波的探测开创了引力天文学的时代，并开启了宇宙资源多学者研究的新途径。由于它们的灵敏度，先进的LIGO和先进的处女座干涉仪将探测更大的空间体积并扩大发现新的引力波发射器的能力。为了识别噪声的主要来源并优化干涉仪的灵敏度，这些检测器的特性是首要任务。毛刺是可能影响干涉仪数据质量的瞬态噪声事件，它们的分类是检测器特性的重要任务。深度学习技术是识别和分类故障的有前景的工具。我们提出了一种分类流水线，它利用卷积神经网络将毛刺从它们的时频演变开始分类，表示为图像。我们评估了仿真毛刺的分类精度，表明所提出的算法能够以非常快的时间尺度和高准确度对毛刺进行自动分类，从而为在线检测器表征提供了一个有前途的工具。
