##### Abstract
With the popularity of mobile devices, personalized speech recognizer becomes more realizable today and highly attractive. Each mobile device is primarily used by a single user, so it's possible to have a personalized recognizer well matching to the characteristics of individual user. Although acoustic model personalization has been investigated for decades, much less work have been reported on personalizing language model, probably because of the difficulties in collecting enough personalized corpora. Previous work used the corpora collected from social networks to solve the problem, but constructing a personalized model for each user is troublesome. In this paper, we propose a universal recurrent neural network language model with user characteristic features, so all users share the same model, except each with different user characteristic features. These user characteristic features can be obtained by crowdsouring over social networks, which include huge quantity of texts posted by users with known friend relationships, who may share some subject topics and wording patterns. The preliminary experiments on Facebook corpus showed that this proposed approach not only drastically reduced the model perplexity, but offered very good improvement in recognition accuracy in n-best rescoring tests. This approach also mitigated the data sparseness problem for personalized language models.

随着移动设备的普及，个性化的语音识别器变得更加可实现且非常有吸引力。每个移动设备主要由单个用户使用，所以可以有一个个性化的识别器，以适应个人用户的特点。尽管声学模型个性化已经被研究了数十年，但是在个性化语言模型方面已经报道了很少的工作，可能是因为收集足够的个性化语料库的困难。以前的工作使用从社交网络收集的语料来解决问题，但是为每个用户构建个性化模型是麻烦的。本文提出了一种具有用户特征特征的通用回归神经网络语言模型，所有用户共享相同的模型，除具有不同的用户特征特征外。这些用户特征可以通过社交网络来获得，其中包括具有已知朋友关系的用户张贴的大量文本，他们可以共享一些主题和措辞模式。 Facebook的语料库初步实验表明，这种方法不仅大大减少了模型的困惑，而且在n-best分数测试中提高了识别准确率。这种方法也减轻了个性化语言模型的数据稀疏性问题。
