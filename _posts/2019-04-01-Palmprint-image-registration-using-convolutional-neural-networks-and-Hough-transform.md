##### Abstract
Minutia-based palmprint recognition systems has got lots of interest in last two decades. Due to the large number of minutiae in a palmprint, approximately 1000 minutiae, the matching process is time consuming which makes it unpractical for real time applications. One way to address this issue is aligning all palmprint images to a reference image and bringing them to a same coordinate system. Bringing all palmprint images to a same coordinate system, results in fewer computations during minutia matching. In this paper, using convolutional neural network (CNN) and generalized Hough transform (GHT), we propose a new method to register palmprint images accurately. This method, finds the corresponding rotation and displacement (in both x and y direction) between the palmprint and a reference image. Exact palmprint registration can enhance the speed and the accuracy of matching process. Proposed method is capable of distinguishing between left and right palmprint automatically which helps to speed up the matching process. Furthermore, designed structure of CNN in registration stage, gives us the segmented palmprint image from background which is a pre-processing step for minutia extraction. The proposed registration method followed by minutia-cylinder code (MCC) matching algorithm has been evaluated on the THUPALMLAB database, and the results show the superiority of our algorithm over most of the state-of-the-art algorithms.
