##### Abstract
This paper describes the design and implementation of a ground-related odometry sensor suitable for micro aerial vehicles. The sensor is based on a ground-facing camera and a single-board Linux-based embedded computer with a multimedia System on a Chip (SoC). The SoC features a hardware video encoder which is used to estimate the optical flow online. The optical flow is then used in combination with a distance sensor to estimate the vehicle's velocity. The proposed sensor is compared to a similar existing solution and evaluated in both indoor and outdoor environments.
