##### Abstract
Person re-identification (re-ID) has become increasingly popular in the community due to its application and research significance. It aims at spotting a person of interest in other cameras. In the early days, hand-crafted algorithms and small-scale evaluation were predominantly reported. Recent years have witnessed the emergence of large-scale datasets and deep learning systems which make use of large data volumes. Considering different tasks, we classify most current re-ID methods into two classes, i.e., image-based and video-based; in both tasks, hand-crafted and deep learning systems will be reviewed. Moreover, two new re-ID tasks which are much closer to real-world applications are described and discussed, i.e., end-to-end re-ID and fast re-ID in very large galleries. This paper: 1) introduces the history of person re-ID and its relationship with image classification and instance retrieval; 2) surveys a broad selection of the hand-crafted systems and the large-scale methods in both image- and video-based re-ID; 3) describes critical future directions in end-to-end re-ID and fast retrieval in large galleries; and 4) finally briefs some important yet under-developed issues.

由于其应用和研究意义，人们重新认同（re-ID）在社区中越来越受欢迎。它旨在发现其他相机感兴趣的人。在早期，主要报告手工算法和小规模评估。近年来出现了大量数据集和深度学习系统，利用大数据量。考虑到不同的任务，我们将目前大多数的重新识别方法分为两类：基于图像的和基于视频的;在这两个任务中，手工制作和深度学习系统将被审查。此外，还描述并讨论了两个与真实世界的应用非常接近的新的重新ID识别任务，即非常大的画廊中的端到端重新识别和快速重新识别。本文的主要工作如下：1）介绍了个人身份识别的历史及其与图像分类和实例检索的关系; 2）在基于图像和视频的再识别中调查手工系统和大规模方法的广泛选择; 3）描述了大型画廊中端到端重新识别和快速检索的重要未来方向; 4）最后简要介绍一些重要而尚未发展的问题。
