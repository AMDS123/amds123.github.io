##### Abstract
This paper discusses the stability of an equilibrium point of an ordinary differential equation (ODE) arising from a feed-forward position control for a musculoskeletal system. The studied system has a link, a joint and two muscles with routing points. The motion convergence of the system strongly depends on the muscular arrangement of the musculoskeletal system. In this paper, a sufficient condition for asymptotic stability is obtained. Furthermore, numerical simulations of the penalized ODE and experimental results are described.
