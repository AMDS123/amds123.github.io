##### Abstract
In this paper, we propose an interactive matching network (IMN) to enhance the representations of contexts and responses at both the word level and sentence level for the multi-turn response selection task. First, IMN constructs word representations from three aspects to address the challenge of out-of-vocabulary (OOV) words. Second, an attentive hierarchical recurrent encoder (AHRE), which is capable of encoding sentences hierarchically and generating more descriptive representations by aggregating with an attention mechanism, is designed. Finally, the bidirectional interactions between whole multi-turn contexts and response candidates are calculated to derive the matching information between them. Experiments on four public datasets show that IMN significantly outperforms the baseline models by large margins on all metrics, achieving new state-of-the-art performance and demonstrating compatibility across domains for multi-turn response selection.
