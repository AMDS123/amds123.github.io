##### Abstract
Future 5G wireless networks will rely on agile and automated network management, where the usage of diverse resources must be jointly optimized with surgical accuracy. A number of key wireless network functionalities (e.g., traffic steering, power control) give rise to hard optimization problems. What is more, high spatio-temporal traffic variability coupled with the need to satisfy strict per slice/service SLAs in modern networks, suggest that these problems must be constantly (re-)solved, to maintain close-to-optimal performance. To this end, we propose the framework of Online Network Optimization (ONO), which seeks to maintain both agile and efficient control over time, using an arsenal of data-driven, online learning, and AI-based techniques. Since the mathematical tools and the studied regimes vary widely among these methodologies, a theoretical comparison is often out of reach. Therefore, the important question `what is the right ONO technique?' remains open to date. In this paper, we discuss the pros and cons of each technique and present a direct quantitative comparison for a specific use case, using real data. Our results suggest that carefully combining the insights of problem modeling with state-of-the-art AI techniques provides significant advantages at reasonable complexity.
