##### Abstract
We propose an end-to-end deep learning learning model for graph classification and representation learning that is invariant to permutation of the nodes of the input graphs. We address the challenge of learning a fixed size graph representation for graphs of varying dimensions through a differentiable node attention pooling mechanism. In addition to a theoretical proof of its invariance to permutation, we provide empirical evidence demonstrating the statistically significant gain in accuracy when faced with an isomorphic graph classification task given only a small number of training examples. We analyse the effect of four different matrices to facilitate the local message passing mechanism by which graph convolutions are performed vs. a matrix parametrised by a learned parameter pair able to transition smoothly between the former. Finally, we show that our model achieves competitive classification performance with existing techniques on a set of molecule datasets.
