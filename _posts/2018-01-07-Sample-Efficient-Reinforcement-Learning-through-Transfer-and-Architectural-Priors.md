##### Abstract
Recent work in deep reinforcement learning has allowed algorithms to learn complex tasks such as Atari 2600 games just from the reward provided by the game, but these algorithms presently require millions of training steps in order to learn, making them approximately five orders of magnitude slower than humans. One reason for this is that humans build robust shared representations that are applicable to collections of problems, making it much easier to assimilate new variants. This paper first introduces the idea of automatically-generated game sets to aid in transfer learning research, and then demonstrates the utility of shared representations by showing that models can substantially benefit from the incorporation of relevant architectural priors. This technique affords a remarkable 50x positive transfer on a toy problem-set.

最近在深度强化学习方面的工作使算法能够从游戏提供的奖励中学习Atari 2600游戏等复杂的任务，但是这些算法目前需要数百万个训练步骤才能学习，使得它们大约比人类。其中一个原因是人类可以建立适用于问题集合的强大的共享表示，使得更容易吸收新的变体。本文首先介绍了自动生成的游戏集的概念，以帮助转移学习研究，然后通过显示模型可以从相关的建筑优先考虑显着受益，演示共享表示的效用。这种技术可以在玩具问题集上提供显着的50倍积极转移。
