##### Abstract
The Quick, Draw! Dataset is a Google dataset with a collection of 50 million drawings, divided in 345 categories, collected from the users of the game Quick, Draw!. In contrast with most of the existing image datasets, in the Quick, Draw! Dataset, drawings are stored as time series of pencil positions instead of a bitmap matrix composed by pixels. This aspect makes this dataset the largest doodle dataset available at the time. The Quick, Draw! Dataset is presented as a great opportunity to researchers for developing and studying machine learning techniques. Due to the size of this dataset and the nature of its source, there is a scarce of information about the quality of the drawings contained. In this paper, a statistical analysis of three of the classes contained in the Quick, Draw! Dataset is depicted: mountain, book and whale. The goal is to give to the reader a first impression of the data collected in this dataset. For the analysis of the quality of the drawings, a Classification Neural Network was trained to obtain a classification score. Using this classification score and the parameters provided by the dataset, a statistical analysis of the quality and nature of the drawings contained in this dataset is provided.
