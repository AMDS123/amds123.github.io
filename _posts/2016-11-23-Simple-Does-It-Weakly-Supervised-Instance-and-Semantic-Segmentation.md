##### Abstract
Semantic labelling and instance segmentation are two tasks that require particularly costly annotations. Starting from weak supervision in the form of bounding box detection annotations, we propose a new approach that does not require modification of the segmentation training procedure. We show that when carefully designing the input labels from given bounding boxes, even a single round of training is enough to improve over previously reported weakly supervised results. Overall, our weak supervision approach reaches ~95% of the quality of the fully supervised model, both for semantic labelling and instance segmentation.

语义标注和实例分割是需要特别昂贵的注释的两个任务。从边界框检测注释形式的弱监督开始，提出了一种不需要修改分割训练过程的新方法。我们表明，当仔细设计来自给定包围盒的输入标签时，即使是单轮训练也足以改善先前报道的弱监督结果。总体而言，我们的弱监督方法达到全监督模型的质量的95％，无论是语义标记和实例分割。
