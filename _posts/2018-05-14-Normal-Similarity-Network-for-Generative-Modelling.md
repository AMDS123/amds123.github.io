##### Abstract
Gaussian distributions are commonly used as a key building block in many generative models. However, their applicability has not been well explored in deep networks. In this paper, we propose a novel deep generative model named as Normal Similarity Network (NSN) where the layers are constructed with Gaussian-style filters. NSN is trained with a layer-wise non-parametric density estimation algorithm that iteratively down-samples the training images and captures the density of the down-sampled training images in the final layer. Additionally, we propose NSN-Gen for generating new samples from noise vectors by iteratively reconstructing feature maps in the hidden layers of NSN. Our experiments suggest encouraging results of the proposed model for a wide range of computer vision applications including image generation, styling and reconstruction from occluded images.

高斯分布通常被用作许多生成模型中的关键构建块。然而，它们的适用性在深度网络中尚未得到很好的探索。在本文中，我们提出了一种新的深度生成模型，称为正态相似网络（NSN），其中层是用高斯型滤波器构建的。 NSN采用逐层非参数密度估计算法进行训练，该算法对训练图像进行迭代下采样并捕获最终图层中下采样训练图像的密度。另外，我们提出NSN-Gen用于通过在NSN的隐藏层中迭代重建特征映射来从噪声向量生成新样本。我们的实验表明，所提出的模型可用于各种计算机视觉应用，包括图像生成，遮挡图像的造型和重建。
