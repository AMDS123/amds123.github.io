##### Abstract
This paper introduces the concept of kernels on fuzzy sets as a similarity measure for $[0,1]$-valued functions, a.k.a. \emph{membership functions of fuzzy sets}. 
 We defined the following classes of kernels: the cross product, the intersection, the non-singleton and the distance-based kernels on fuzzy sets. 
 Applicability of those kernels are on machine learning and data science tasks where uncertainty in data has an ontic or epistemistic interpretation.
