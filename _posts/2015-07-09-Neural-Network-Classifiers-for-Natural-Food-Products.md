##### Abstract
Two cheap, off-the-shelf machine vision systems (MVS), each using an artificial neural network (ANN) as classifier, were developed, improved and evaluated to automate the classification of tomato ripeness and acceptability of eggs, respectively. Six thousand color images of human-graded tomatoes and 750 images of human-graded eggs were used to train, test, and validate several multi-layered ANNs. The ANNs output the corresponding grade of the produce by accepting as inputs the spectral patterns of the background-less image. In both MVS, the ANN with the highest validation rate was automatically chosen by a heuristic and its performance compared to that of the human graders'. Using the validation set, the MVS correctly graded 97.00\% and 86.00\% of the tomato and egg data, respectively. The human grader's, however, were measured to perform at a daily average of 92.65\% and 72.67\% for tomato and egg grading, respectively. This results show that an ANN-based MVS is a potential alternative to manual grading.

两个便宜的现成的机器视觉系统（MVS），分别使用人工神经网络（ANN）作为分类器，被开发，改进和评估，以自动分类番茄的成熟度和蛋的可接受性。人类等级番茄的六千个彩色图像和人类等级蛋的750个图像被用来训练，测试和验证几个多层次的人工神经网络。 ANN通过接受无背景图像的光谱图案输出相应的产品等级。在两个MVS中，具有最高验证率的ANN是通过启发式自动选择的，并且其性能与人类分级者相比较。使用验证集合，MVS分别正确地分级番茄和蛋数据的97.00％和86.00％。然而，对于西红柿和鸡蛋分级，人类平地的年龄分别为92.65％和72.67％。这个结果表明，基于人工神经网络的MVS是一个潜在的手动分级的替代方案。
