##### Abstract
Unfair pricing policies have been shown to be one of the most negative perceptions customers can have concerning pricing, and may result in long-term losses for a company. Despite the fact that dynamic pricing models help companies maximize revenue, fairness and equality should be taken into account in order to avoid unfair price differences between groups of customers. This paper shows how to solve dynamic pricing by using Reinforcement Learning (RL) techniques so that prices are maximized while keeping a balance between revenue and fairness. We demonstrate that RL provides two main features to support fairness in dynamic pricing: on the one hand, RL is able to learn from recent experience, adapting the pricing policy to complex market environments; on the other hand, it provides a trade-off between short and long-term objectives, hence integrating fairness into the model's core. Considering these two features, we propose the application of RL for revenue optimization, with the additional integration of fairness as part of the learning procedure by using Jain's index as a metric. Results in a simulated environment show a significant improvement in fairness while at the same time maintaining optimisation of revenue.

不公平的定价政策已被证明是客户对定价最负面的看法之一，并可能导致公司长期亏损。尽管动态定价模型有助于企业实现收入最大化，但应考虑到公平和平等，以避免不同客户群之间的价格差异。本文展示了如何使用强化学习（RL）技术来解决动态定价问题，从而在保持收入和公平之间的平衡的同时价格最大化。我们证明RL提供了两个主要特征来支持动态定价的公平性：一方面，RL能够从最近的经验中学习，将定价策略适应于复杂的市场环境;另一方面，它提供了短期和长期目标之间的平衡，从而将公平纳入模型的核心。考虑到这两个特点，我们提出将RL应用于收入优化，并将Jain索引作为衡量标准，将公平性作为学习过程的一部分。在模拟环境中的结果显示了公平性的显着提高，同时保持了收入的优化。
