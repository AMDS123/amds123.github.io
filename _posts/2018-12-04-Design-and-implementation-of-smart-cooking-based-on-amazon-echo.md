##### Abstract
Smart cooking based on Amazon Echo uses the internet of things and cloud computing to assist in cooking food. People may speak to Amazon Echo during the cooking in order to get the information and situation of the cooking. Amazon Echo recognizes what people say, then transfers the information to the cloud services, and speaks to people the results that cloud services make by querying the embedded cooking knowledge and achieving the information of intelligent kitchen devices online. An intelligent food thermometer and its mobile application are well-designed and implemented to monitor the temperature of cooking food.
