##### Abstract
The influence of a microwave treatment (MWT) on the optical properties of hexagonal GaN films has been studied. To estimate the internal mechanical strains and the degree of structural perfection in a thin near-surface layer of the film, the electroreflectance (ER) method is used. The ER spectra are measured in the interval of the first direct interband transitions. It has been shown that the MWT results in the relaxation of internal mechanical strains in the irradiated films. In addition, the structural perfection in the thin near-surface layer of the irradiated film became higher. A mechanism that includes resonance effects and the local heating of the film defect regions is proposed to explain the effects observed.

已经研究了微波处理（MWT）对六方GaN膜的光学性质的影响。为了估计膜的薄的近表面层中的内部机械应变和结构完善的程度，使用电反射（ER）方法。 ER谱是在第一个直接带间跃迁的间隔内测量的。已经表明，MWT导致放射性膜中的内部机械应变的松弛。另外，照射膜的薄的近表面层的结构完整性变高。提出了包括共振效应和膜缺陷区局部加热的机理来解释观察到的效应。
