##### Abstract
The Three Gorges Dam, a massive cross-century project spans the Yangtze River by the town of Sandouping, located in Yichang, Hubei province, China, was built to provide great power, improve the River shipping, control floods in the upper reaches of the Yangtze River, and increase the dry season flow in the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River. Benefits are enormous and comprehensive. However, the social and environmental impacts are also immense and far-reaching to its surrounding areas. Mapping land use /land cover changed (LUCC) is critical for tracking the impacts. Remote sensing has been proved to be an effective way to map and monitor land use change in real time and in large areas such as the Three Gorges Reservoir Area(TGRA) by using pixel based or oriented based classifier in different resolution. In this paper, we first test the state of the art semantic segmentation deep learning classifiers for LUCC mapping with 7 categories in the TGRA area with rapideye 5m resolution data. The topographic information was also added for better accuracy in mountain area. By compared with the pixel-based classifier, the semantic segmentation deep learning method has better accuracy and robustness at 5m resolution level.

三峡大坝是一个横跨长江的大型跨世纪工程，位于中国湖北省宜昌市的三坡坪镇，是为提供强大动力，改善内河航运，控制上游的洪水而建造的。长江，增加长江中下游旱季流量。好处是巨大而全面的。但是，其周边地区的社会和环境影响也是巨大而深远的。测绘土地利用/土地覆盖变化（LUCC）对追踪影响至关重要。遥感已被证明是一种有效的方法，通过使用不同分辨率的基于像素或基于方向的分类器，实时绘制和监测三峡库区（TGRA）等大面积土地利用变化。在本文中，我们首先测试TGRA区域7个类别的LUCC映射的最先进的语义分割深度学习分类器的状态，其中具有rapideye 5m分辨率数据。还增加了地形信息以提高山区的精确度。与基于像素的分类器相比，语义分割深度学习方法在5m分辨率水平下具有更好的精度和鲁棒性。
