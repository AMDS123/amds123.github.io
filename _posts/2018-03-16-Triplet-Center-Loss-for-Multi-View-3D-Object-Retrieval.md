##### Abstract
Most existing 3D object recognition algorithms focus on leveraging the strong discriminative power of deep learning models with softmax loss for the classification of 3D data, while learning discriminative features with deep metric learning for 3D object retrieval is more or less neglected. In the paper, we study variants of deep metric learning losses for 3D object retrieval, which did not receive enough attention from this area. First , two kinds of representative losses, triplet loss and center loss, are introduced which could learn more discriminative features than traditional classification loss. Then, we propose a novel loss named triplet-center loss, which can further enhance the discriminative power of the features. The proposed triplet-center loss learns a center for each class and requires that the distances between samples and centers from the same class are closer than those from different classes. Extensive experimental results on two popular 3D object retrieval benchmarks and two widely-adopted sketch-based 3D shape retrieval benchmarks consistently demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed loss, and significant improvements have been achieved compared with the state-of-the-arts.

大多数现有的3D物体识别算法都集中在利用深度学习模型的强大判别能力以及用于3D数据分类的softmax损失，而用于3D物体检索的深度量度学习的识别特征或多或少被忽略。在本文中，我们研究了三维物体检索的深度量度学习损失的变体，但没有从这个领域得到足够的关注。首先，引入两种代表性损失，三重损失和中心损失，这些损失可以比传统分类损失学习更多的判别性特征。然后，我们提出一种新的损失称为三重中心损失，它可以进一步增强特征的判别力。建议的三重中心损失学习每个类别的中心，并要求来自同一类别的样本和中心之间的距离比来自不同类别的样本和中心之间的距离更近。对两个流行的三维物体检索基准和两个广泛采用的基于草图的三维形状检索基准的广泛实验结果一致证明了我们提出的损失的有效性，并且与现有技术相比已经实现了显着的改进。
