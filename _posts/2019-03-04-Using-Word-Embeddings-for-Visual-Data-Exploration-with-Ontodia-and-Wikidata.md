##### Abstract
One of the big challenges in Linked Data consumption is to create visual and natural language interfaces to the data usable for non-technical users. Ontodia provides support for diagrammatic data exploration, showcased in this publication in combination with the Wikidata dataset. We present improvements to the natural language interface regarding exploring and querying Linked Data entities. The method uses models of distributional semantics to find and rank entity properties related to user input in Ontodia. Various word embedding types and model settings are evaluated, and the results show that user experience in visual data exploration benefits from the proposed approach.
