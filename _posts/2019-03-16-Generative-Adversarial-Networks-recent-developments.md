##### Abstract
In traditional generative modeling, good data representation is very often a base for a good machine learning model. It can be linked to good representations encoding more explanatory factors that are hidden in the original data. With the invention of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), a subclass of generative models that are able to learn representations in an unsupervised and semi-supervised fashion, we are now able to adversarially learn good mappings from a simple prior distribution to a target data distribution. This paper presents an overview of recent developments in GANs with a focus on learning latent space representations.
