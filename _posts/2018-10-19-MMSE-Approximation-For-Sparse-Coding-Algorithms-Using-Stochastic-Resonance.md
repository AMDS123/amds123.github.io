##### Abstract
Sparse coding refers to the pursuit of the sparsest representation of a signal in a typically overcomplete dictionary. From a Bayesian perspective, sparse coding provides a Maximum a Posteriori (MAP) estimate of the unknown vector under a sparse prior. Various nonlinear algorithms are available to approximate the solution of such problems. 
 In this work, we suggest enhancing the performance of sparse coding algorithms by a deliberate and controlled contamination of the input with random noise, a phenomenon known as stochastic resonance. This not only allows for increased performance, but also provides a computationally efficient approximation to the Minimum Mean Square Error (MMSE) estimator, which is ordinarily intractable to compute. We demonstrate our findings empirically and provide a theoretical analysis of our method under several different cases.
