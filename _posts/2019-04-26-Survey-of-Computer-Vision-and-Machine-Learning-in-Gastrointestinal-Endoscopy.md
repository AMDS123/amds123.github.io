##### Abstract
This paper attempts to provide the reader a place to begin studying the application of computer vision and machine learning to gastrointestinal (GI) endoscopy. They have been classified into 18 categories. It should be be noted by the reader that this is a review from pre-deep learning era. A lot of deep learning based applications have not been covered in this thesis.
