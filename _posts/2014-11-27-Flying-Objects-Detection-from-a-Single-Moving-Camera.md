##### Abstract
We propose an approach to detect flying objects such as UAVs and aircrafts when they occupy a small portion of the field of view, possibly moving against complex backgrounds, and are filmed by a camera that itself moves. Solving such a difficult problem requires combining both appearance and motion cues. To this end we propose a regression-based approach to motion stabilization of local image patches that allows us to achieve effective classification on spatio-temporal image cubes and outperform state-of-the-art techniques. As the problem is relatively new, we collected two challenging datasets for UAVs and Aircrafts, which can be used as benchmarks for flying objects detection and vision-guided collision avoidance.

##### Abstract (translated by Google)
我们提出一种检测无人机和飞机等飞行物体的方法，当它们占据视场的一小部分时，可能在复杂的背景下移动，并由本身移动的相机拍摄。解决这样一个难题需要结合外观和动作线索。为此，我们提出了一种基于回归的方法来稳定局部图像块，使我们能够实现对时空图像立方体的有效分类并超越最先进的技术。由于问题比较新，我们收集了无人机和飞机两个具有挑战性的数据集，可以作为飞行物体检测和视觉引导避碰的基准。
