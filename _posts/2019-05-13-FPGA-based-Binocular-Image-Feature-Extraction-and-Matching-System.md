##### Abstract
Image feature extraction and matching is a fundamental but computation intensive task in machine vision. This paper proposes a novel FPGA-based embedded system to accelerate feature extraction and matching. It implements SURF feature point detection and BRIEF feature descriptor construction and matching. For binocular stereo vision, feature matching includes both tracking matching and stereo matching, which simultaneously provide feature point correspondences and parallax information. Our system is evaluated on a ZYNQ XC7Z045 FPGA. The result demonstrates that it can process binocular video data at a high frame rate (640$\times$480 @ 162fps). Moreover, an extensive test proves our system has robustness for image compression, blurring and illumination.
