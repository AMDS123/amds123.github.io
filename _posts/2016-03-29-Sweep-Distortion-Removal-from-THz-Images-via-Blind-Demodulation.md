##### Abstract
Heavy sweep distortion induced by alignments and inter-reflections of layers of a sample is a major burden in recovering 2D and 3D information in time resolved spectral imaging. This problem cannot be addressed by conventional denoising and signal processing techniques as it heavily depends on the physics of the acquisition. Here we propose and implement an algorithmic framework based on low-rank matrix recovery and alternating minimization that exploits the forward model for THz acquisition. The method allows recovering the original signal in spite of the presence of temporal-spatial distortions. We address a blind-demodulation problem, where based on several observations of the sample texture modulated by an undesired sweep pattern, the two classes of signals are separated. The performance of the method is examined in both synthetic and experimental data, and the successful reconstructions are demonstrated. The proposed general scheme can be implemented to advance inspection and imaging applications in THz and other time-resolved sensing modalities.

由样品层的对准和相互反射引起的重度扫描失真是在时间分辨光谱成像中恢复2D和3D信息的主要负担。传统的去噪和信号处理技术无法解决这个问题，因为它非常依赖于采集的物理学。在这里，我们提出并实施基于低秩矩阵恢复和交替最小化的算法框架，其利用THz采集的正演模型。尽管存在时间空间失真，该方法允许恢复原始信号。我们解决了一个盲解调问题，其中基于由不希望的扫描模式调制的样本纹理的多次观察，两类信号被分离。该方法的性能在合成和实验数据都被检查，并且成功的重建被证明。所提出的一般方案可以实施以促进THz和其他时间分辨感测模式中的检查和成像应用。
