##### Abstract
Breast cancer is the most prevalent cancer type in women, and while its survival rate is generally high the aesthetic outcome is an increasingly important factor when evaluating different treatment alternatives. 3D scanning and reconstruction techniques offer a flexible tool for building detailed and accurate 3D breast models that can be used both pre-operatively for surgical planning and post-operatively for aesthetic evaluation. This paper aims at comparing the accuracy of low-cost 3D scanning technologies with the significantly more expensive state-of-the-art 3D commercial scanners in the context of breast 3D reconstruction. We present results from 28 synthetic and clinical RGBD sequences, including 12 unique patients and an anthropomorphic phantom demonstrating the applicability of low-cost RGBD sensors to real clinical cases. Body deformation and homogeneous skin texture pose challenges to the studied reconstruction systems. Although these should be addressed appropriately if higher model quality is warranted, we observe that low-cost sensors are able to obtain valuable reconstructions comparable to the state-of-the-art within an error margin of 3 mm.

乳腺癌是女性中最普遍的癌症类型，虽然其生存率普遍较高，但在评估不同的治疗方案时，美学结果是越来越重要的因素。三维扫描和重建技术提供了一个灵活的工具，建立详细和准确的3D乳房模型，可以用于术前术前规划和术后美学评估。本文旨在比较低成本的3D扫描技术与在乳房三维重建背景下显着更昂贵的最先进的3D商业扫描仪的准确性。我们提供了来自28个合成和临床RGBD序列的结果，其中包括12个独特的患者和一个拟人化体模，演示了低成本RGBD传感器对真实临床病例的适用性。身体变形和均匀的皮肤纹理对所研究的重建系统构成挑战。如果需要更高的模型质量，应该适当地解决这些问题，但是我们观察到低成本的传感器能​​够在3mm的误差范围内获得与现有技术相媲美的有价值的重建。
