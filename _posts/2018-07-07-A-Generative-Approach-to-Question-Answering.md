##### Abstract
Question Answering has come a long way from answer sentence selection, relational QA to reading and comprehension. We shift our attention to generative question answering (gQA) by which we facilitate machine to read passages and answer questions by learning to generate the answers. We frame the problem as a generative task where the encoder being a network that models the relationship between question and passage and encoding them to a vector thus facilitating the decoder to directly form an abstraction of the answer. Not being able to retain facts and making repetitions are common mistakes that affect the overall legibility of answers. To counter these issues, we employ copying mechanism and maintenance of coverage vector in our model respectively. Our results on MS-MARCO demonstrate it's superiority over baselines and we also show qualitative examples where we improved in terms of correctness and readability

问题回答从答案句选择，关系QA到阅读和理解已经走了很长的路。我们将注意力转移到生成问答（gQA）上，通过学习生成答案，我们通过该问题促进机器阅读段落并回答问题。我们将问题定义为生成任务，其中编码器是模拟问题和通道之间的关系并将它们编码为向量的网络，从而便于解码器直接形成答案的抽象。不能保留事实和重复是常见的错误，会影响答案的整体易读性。为了解决这些问题，我们分别在模型中采用了复制机制和覆盖矢量的维护。我们在MS-MARCO上的结果证明了它比基线的优越性，我们还展示了我们在正确性和可读性方面进行了改进的定性示例
