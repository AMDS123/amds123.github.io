##### Abstract
Nowadays, big effort is being put to study gamification and what gamified applications can do to engage players. Therefore, aspects such as the impact social game mechanics have are being approached. In this work, we focus on the generation of certain types of interaction mechanics to lead players to achieve what we think are the three basic types of social interactions: cooperation, competition and individual exploration. This was done by adapting a game called CrossAnt so that certain interaction mechanics could be generated in certain moments. Our results show that although cooperation could be promoted, longer interactions may be needed so that the other types of behavior can emerge.
