##### Abstract
The role of symmetry in computer vision has waxed and waned in importance during the evolution of the field from its earliest days. At first figuring prominently in support of bottom-up indexing, it fell out of favor as shape gave way to appearance and recognition gave way to detection. With a strong prior in the form of a target object, the role of the weaker priors offered by perceptual grouping was greatly diminished. However, as the field returns to the problem of recognition from a large database, the bottom-up recovery of the parts that make up the objects in a cluttered scene is critical for their recognition. The medial axis community has long exploited the ubiquitous regularity of symmetry as a basis for the decomposition of a closed contour into medial parts. However, today's recognition systems are faced with cluttered scenes, and the assumption that a closed contour exists, i.e. that figure-ground segmentation has been solved, renders much of the medial axis community's work inapplicable. In this article, we review a computational framework, previously reported in Lee et al. (2013), Levinshtein et al. (2009, 2013), that bridges the representation power of the medial axis and the need to recover and group an object's parts in a cluttered scene. Our framework is rooted in the idea that a maximally inscribed disc, the building block of a medial axis, can be modeled as a compact superpixel in the image. We evaluate the method on images of cluttered scenes.

对称性在计算机视觉领域的作用早在这个领域的发展过程中就起了重要的作用。起初在支持自下而上的索引方面做出了突出的贡献，因形状让位而失色，认可让位于发现。以目标对象的形式强有力地提前，感性分组所提供的较弱先质的作用大大减弱。然而，随着现场回到大型数据库识别的问题，构成混乱场景中物体的部分的自下而上的恢复对它们的识别是至关重要的。中轴线社区长期利用对称性的无处不在的规律性作为将封闭轮廓分解成内侧部分的基础。然而，今天的识别系统面临着混乱的场景，并且假设闭合的轮廓存在，即图形 - 地面分割已经被解决，使得很多中轴线的工作不适用。在这篇文章中，我们回顾一个计算框架，以前在李等人报告。 （2013），Levinshtein等人（2009,2013），它弥合了中轴的代表能力，以及在混乱的场景中恢复和分组物体的需求。我们的框架根植于这样的想法，即一个最大内切圆盘，一个中轴的构件，可以被模拟成一个紧凑的超像素的图像。我们评估在杂乱的场景图像的方法。
