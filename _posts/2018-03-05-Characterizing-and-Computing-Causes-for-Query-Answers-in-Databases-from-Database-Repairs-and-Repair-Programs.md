##### Abstract
A correspondence between database tuples as causes for query answers in databases and tuple-based repairs of inconsistent databases with respect to denial constraints has already been established. In this work, answer-set programs that specify repairs of databases are used as a basis for solving computational and reasoning problems about causes. Here, causes are also introduced at the attribute level by appealing to a both null-based and attribute-based repair semantics. The corresponding repair programs are presented, and they are used as a basis for computation and reasoning about attribute-level causes.

##### Abstract (translated by Google)
已经建立了数据库元组之间的对应关系，作为数据库中查询答案的原因，以及与拒绝约束条件有关的不一致数据库的基于元组的修复。在这项工作中，指定修复数据库的答案集程序被用作解决关于原因的计算和推理问题的基础。在这里，通过吸引基于空值和基于属性的修复语义，还引入了属性级别的原因。介绍了相应的修理程序，并将它们用作计算和推理属性级原因的基础。
