##### Abstract
In this paper, we show that ultrathin GaN membranes having a thickness of 15 nm and planar dimensions of 12x184 microns act as memristive devices. This fact is due to the migration of the negatively charged deep traps, which form in the volume of the membrane during the fabrication process, towards the unoccupied surface states of the suspended membranes. The time constant of the migration process is of the order of tens of second and varies with the current or voltage sweep.
