##### Abstract
Action recognition is a vital task in computer vision, and many methods are developed to push it to the limit. However, current action recognition models have huge computational costs, which cannot be deployed to real-world tasks on mobile devices. In this paper, we first illustrate the setting of real-time action recognition, which is different from current action recognition inference settings. Under the new inference setting, we investigate state-of-the-art action recognition models on the Kinetics dataset empirically. Our results show that designing efficient real-time action recognition models is different from designing efficient ImageNet models, especially in weight initialization. We show that pre-trained weights on ImageNet improve the accuracy under the real-time action recognition setting. Finally, we use the hand gesture recognition task as a case study to evaluate our compact real-time action recognition models in real-world applications on mobile phones. Results show that our action recognition models, being 6x faster and with similar accuracy as state-of-the-art, can roughly meet the real-time requirements on mobile devices. To our best knowledge, this is the first paper that deploys current deep learning action recognition models on mobile devices.
