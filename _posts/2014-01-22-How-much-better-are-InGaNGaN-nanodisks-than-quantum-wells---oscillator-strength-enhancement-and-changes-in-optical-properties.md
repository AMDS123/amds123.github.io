##### Abstract
We show over 100-fold enhancement of the exciton oscillator strength as the diameter of an InGaN nanodisk in a GaN nanopillar is reduced from a few micrometers to less than 40 nm, corresponding to the quantum dot limit. The enhancement results from significant strain relaxation in nanodisks less than 100 nm in diameter. Meanwhile, the radiative decay rate is only improved by 10 folds due to strong reduction of the local density of photon states in small nanodisks. Further increase in the radiative decay rate can be achieved by engineering the local density of photon states, such as adding a dielectric coating.

##### Abstract (translated by Google)
随着量子点极限的增加，GaN纳米柱中的InGaN纳米盘的直径从几微米减小到小于40纳米，我们表现出超过100倍的激子振荡器强度的增强。纳米盘直径小于100纳米的显着应变松弛的增强效果。同时由于小纳米盘中光子态密度的大幅度下降，辐射衰减率只提高了10倍。辐射衰减率的进一步增加可以通过设计光子态的局部密度来实现，例如添加电介质涂层。
