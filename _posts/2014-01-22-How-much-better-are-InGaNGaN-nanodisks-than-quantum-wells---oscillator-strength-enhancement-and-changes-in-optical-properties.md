##### Abstract
We show over 100-fold enhancement of the exciton oscillator strength as the diameter of an InGaN nanodisk in a GaN nanopillar is reduced from a few micrometers to less than 40 nm, corresponding to the quantum dot limit. The enhancement results from significant strain relaxation in nanodisks less than 100 nm in diameter. Meanwhile, the radiative decay rate is only improved by 10 folds due to strong reduction of the local density of photon states in small nanodisks. Further increase in the radiative decay rate can be achieved by engineering the local density of photon states, such as adding a dielectric coating.
