##### Abstract
Mobile-phones have facilitated the creation of field-portable, cost-effective imaging and sensing technologies that approach laboratory-grade instrument performance. However, the optical imaging interfaces of mobile-phones are not designed for microscopy and produce spatial and spectral distortions in imaging microscopic specimens. Here, we report on the use of deep learning to correct such distortions introduced by mobile-phone-based microscopes, facilitating the production of high-resolution, denoised and colour-corrected images, matching the performance of benchtop microscopes with high-end objective lenses, also extending their limited depth-of-field. After training a convolutional neural network, we successfully imaged various samples, including blood smears, histopathology tissue sections, and parasites, where the recorded images were highly compressed to ease storage and transmission for telemedicine applications. This method is applicable to other low-cost, aberrated imaging systems, and could offer alternatives for costly and bulky microscopes, while also providing a framework for standardization of optical images for clinical and biomedical applications.

移动电话有助于创造便于使用的现场便携式，成本低廉的成像和传感技术，从而达到实验室级别的仪器性能。然而，移动电话的光学成像接口并不是为显微镜设计的，并且在成像显微镜样品中产生空间和光谱失真。在这里，我们报告了深度学习的使用，以纠正由移动电话显微镜引入的这种扭曲，促进高分辨率，去噪和色彩校正图像的生产，使台式显微镜的性能与高端物镜，也扩大了他们有限的景深。在训练卷积神经网络之后，我们成功地成像了各种样本，包括血液涂片，组织病理学组织切片和寄生虫，其中记录的图像被高度压缩以便于远程医疗应用的存储和传输。这种方法适用于其他低成本，畸变成像系统，可以提供替代昂贵和庞大的显微镜，同时也为临床和生物医学应用的光学图像的标准化提供了框架。
