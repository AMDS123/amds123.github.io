##### Abstract
Since the creation of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), much work has been done to improve their training stability, their generated image quality, their range of application but nearly none of them explored their self-training potential. Self-training has been used before the advent of deep learning in order to allow training on limited labelled training data and has shown impressive results in semi-supervised learning. In this work, we combine these two ideas and make GANs self-trainable for semi-supervised learning tasks by exploiting their infinite data generation potential. Results show that using even the simplest form of self-training yields an improvement. We also show results for a more complex self-training scheme that performs at least as well as the basic self-training scheme but with significantly less data augmentation.

自创建敌对网络（GAN）以来，已经做了很多工作来提高他们的训练稳定性，生成的图像质量和应用范围，但几乎没有人探索他们的自我训练潜力。在深度学习出现之前，已经使用了自我训练，以允许对有限的标记训练数据进行训练，并且在半监督学习中显示了令人印象深刻的结果。在这项工作中，我们将这两种思想结合起来，通过利用其无限的数据生成潜力，使GAN可以自主进行半监督学习任务。结果表明，即使使用最简单的自我训练形式也会得到改善。我们还展示了一个更复杂的自我训练方案的结果，该方案至少执行基本的自我训练方案，但是数据增加的数量要少得多。
