##### Abstract
Contour and skeleton are two complementary representations for shape recognition. However combining them in a principal way is nontrivial, as they are generally abstracted by different structures (closed string vs graph), respectively. This paper aims at addressing the shape recognition problem by combining contour and skeleton according to the correspondence between them. The correspondence provides a straightforward way to associate skeletal information with a shape contour. More specifically, we propose a new shape descriptor. named Skeleton-associated Shape Context (SSC), which captures the features of a contour fragment associated with skeletal information. Benefited from the association, the proposed shape descriptor provides the complementary geometric information from both contour and skeleton parts, including the spatial distribution and the thickness change along the shape part. To form a meaningful shape feature vector for an overall shape, the Bag of Features framework is applied to the SSC descriptors extracted from it. Finally, the shape feature vector is fed into a linear SVM classifier to recognize the shape. The encouraging experimental results demonstrate that the proposed way to combine contour and skeleton is effective for shape recognition, which achieves the state-of-the-art performances on several standard shape benchmarks.

轮廓和骨架是形状识别的两个互补表示。但是，将它们以主要方式组合起来是非平凡的，因为它们通常分别由不同的结构（封闭的字符串与图形）抽象出来。本文旨在根据二者之间的对应关系，结合轮廓和骨架来解决形状识别问题。通信提供了一种将骨骼信息与形状轮廓相关联的直接方式。更具体地说，我们提出了一个新的形状描述符。命名为骨架关联形状上下文（SSC），它捕获与骨架信息相关联的轮廓片段的特征。受益于该关联，所提出的形状描述符提供了来自轮廓和骨架部分的互补几何信息，包括沿形状部分的空间分布和厚度变化。为了形成整体形状的有意义的形状特征向量，Bag特征框架被应用于从其提取的SSC描述符。最后，形状特征向量被馈送到线性SVM分类器中以识别形状。令人鼓舞的实验结果表明，所提出的结合轮廓和骨架的方式对于形状识别是有效的，其在几个标准形状基准上实现了最新的性能。
