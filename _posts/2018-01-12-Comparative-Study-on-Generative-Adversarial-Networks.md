##### Abstract
In recent years, there have been tremendous advancements in the field of machine learning. These advancements have been made through both academic as well as industrial research. Lately, a fair amount of research has been dedicated to the usage of generative models in the field of computer vision and image classification. These generative models have been popularized through a new framework called Generative Adversarial Networks. Moreover, many modified versions of this framework have been proposed in the last two years. We study the original model proposed by Goodfellow et al. as well as modifications over the original model and provide a comparative analysis of these models.

近年来，机器学习领域取得了巨大的进步。这些进步是通过学术和工业研究。最近，大量的研究致力于在计算机视觉和图像分类领域中使用生成模型。这些生成模型已经通过一个叫做生成敌对网络的新框架得到推广。此外，这个框架的许多修改版本在过去两年中已经提出。我们研究Goodfellow等人提出的原始模型。以及对原始模型的修改，并提供这些模型的比较分析。
