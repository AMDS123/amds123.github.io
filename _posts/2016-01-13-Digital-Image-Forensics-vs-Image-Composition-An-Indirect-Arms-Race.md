##### Abstract
The field of image composition is constantly trying to improve the ways in which an image can be altered and enhanced. While this is usually done in the name of aesthetics and practicality, it also provides tools that can be used to maliciously alter images. In this sense, the field of digital image forensics has to be prepared to deal with the influx of new technology, in a constant arms-race. In this paper, the current state of this arms-race is analyzed, surveying the state-of-the-art and providing means to compare both sides. A novel scale to classify image forensics assessments is proposed, and experiments are performed to test composition techniques in regards to different forensics traces. We show that even though research in forensics seems unaware of the advanced forms of image composition, it possesses the basic tools to detect it.

图像合成领域不断尝试改进图像可以被改变和增强的方式。虽然这通常是以美学和实用性的名义完成的，但它也提供了可用于恶意改变图像的工具。在这个意义上说，数字图像取证领域必须准备好应对新技术的涌入，在不断的军备竞赛中。本文分析了当前这场军备竞赛的现状，对现状进行了调查，并提供了比较双方的手段。提出了一种分类图像取证评估的新尺度，并对不同的取证痕迹进行了实验测试构图技术。我们表明，即使在取证研究似乎没有意识到图像组成的高级形式，它拥有检测它的基本工具。
