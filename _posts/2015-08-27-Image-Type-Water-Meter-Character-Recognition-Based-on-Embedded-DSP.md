##### Abstract
In the paper, we combined DSP processor with image processing algorithm and studied the method of water meter character recognition. We collected water meter image through camera at a fixed angle, and the projection method is used to recognize those digital images. The experiment results show that the method can recognize the meter characters accurately and artificial meter reading is replaced by automatic digital recognition, which improves working efficiency.

本文将DSP处理器与图像处理算法相结合，研究了水文字符识别方法。我们通过相机以一个固定的角​​度收集水表图像，并用投影方法来识别这些数字图像。实验结果表明，该方法可以准确识别仪表字符，将人工抄表代替为自动数字识别，提高了工作效率。
