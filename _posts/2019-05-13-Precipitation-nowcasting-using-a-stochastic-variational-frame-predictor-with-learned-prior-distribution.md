##### Abstract
We propose the use of a stochastic variational frame prediction deep neural network with a learned prior distribution trained on two-dimensional rain radar reflectivity maps for precipitation nowcasting with lead times of up to 2 1/2 hours. We present a comparison to a standard convolutional LSTM network and assess the evolution of the structural similarity index for both methods. Case studies are presented that illustrate that the novel methodology can yield meaningful forecasts without excessive blur for the time horizons of interest.
