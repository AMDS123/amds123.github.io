##### Abstract
In aspect-based sentiment analysis, most existing methods either focus on aspect/opinion terms extraction or aspect terms categorization. However, each task by itself only provides partial information to end users. To generate more detailed and structured opinion analysis, we propose a finer-grained problem, which we call category-specific aspect and opinion terms extraction. This problem involves the identification of aspect and opinion terms within each sentence, as well as the categorization of the identified terms. To this end, we propose an end-to-end multi-task attention model, where each task corresponds to aspect/opinion terms extraction for a specific category. Our model benefits from exploring the commonalities and relationships among different tasks to address the data sparsity issue. We demonstrate its state-of-the-art performance on three benchmark datasets.
