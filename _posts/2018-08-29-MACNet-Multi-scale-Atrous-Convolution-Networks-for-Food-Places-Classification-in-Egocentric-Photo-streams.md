##### Abstract
First-person (wearable) camera continually captures unscripted interactions of the camera user with objects, people, and scenes reflecting his personal and relational tendencies. One of the preferences of people is their interaction with food events. The regulation of food intake and its duration has a great importance to protect against diseases. Consequently, this work aims to develop a smart model that is able to determine the recurrences of a person on food places during a day. This model is based on a deep end-to-end model for automatic food places recognition by analyzing egocentric photo-streams. In this paper, we apply multi-scale Atrous convolution networks to extract the key features related to food places of the input images. The proposed model is evaluated on an in-house private dataset called "EgoFoodPlaces". Experimental results shows promising results of food places classification recognition in egocentric photo-streams.

第一人称（可穿戴式）相机持续捕捉相机用户与反映其个人和关系倾向的物体，人物和场景的无脚本交互。人们的偏好之一是他们与食物事件的互动。食物摄入量及其持续时间的调节对于预防疾病具有重要意义。因此，这项工作旨在开发一种智能模型，能够确定一天中人们在食品场所的复发。该模型基于深度端到端模型，通过分析以自我为中心的光流来识别自动食物位置。在本文中，我们应用多尺度Atrous卷积网络来提取与输入图像的食物位置相关的关键特征。建议的模型在名为“EgoFoodPlaces”的内部私有数据集上进行评估。实验结果表明，在以自我为中心的光流中，食品位置分类识别具有良好的效果。
