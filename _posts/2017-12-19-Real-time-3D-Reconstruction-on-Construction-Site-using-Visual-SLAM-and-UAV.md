##### Abstract
3D reconstruction can be used as a platform to monitor the performance of activities on construction site, such as construction progress monitoring, structure inspection and post-disaster rescue. Comparing to other sensors, RGB image has the advantages of low-cost, texture rich and easy to implement that has been used as the primary method for 3D reconstruction in construction industry. However, the image-based 3D reconstruction always requires extended time to acquire and/or to process the image data, which limits its application on time critical projects. Recent progress in Visual Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) make it possible to reconstruct a 3D map of construction site in real-time. Integrated with Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV), the obstacles areas that are inaccessible for the ground equipment can also be sensed. Despite these advantages of visual SLAM and UAV, until now, such technique has not been fully investigated on construction site. Therefore, the objective of this research is to present a pilot study of using visual SLAM and UAV for real-time construction site reconstruction. The system architecture and the experimental setup are introduced, and the preliminary results and the potential applications using Visual SLAM and UAV on construction site are discussed.

三维重建可以作为监测施工现场活动性能的平台，如施工进度监测，结构检测和灾后救援。与其他传感器相比，RGB图像具有成本低，质地丰富，易于实现等优点，已被用作建筑行业三维重建的主要手段。然而，基于图像的三维重建总是需要花费较长时间来获取和/或处理图像数据，这限制了其在时间关键项目上的应用。可视同时定位和绘图（SLAM）的最新进展使得可以实时重建施工现场的3D地图。与无人机（UAV）相结合，地面设备无法进入的障碍物区域也可以被感知。尽管视觉SLAM和无人机有这些优点，但到目前为止，这种技术还没有在施工现场进行充分的调查。因此，本研究的目的是提出一个使用视觉SLAM和无人机进行实时施工现场重建的试点研究。介绍了系统的体系结构和实验装置，并讨论了在施工现场使用Visual SLAM和UAV的潜在应用前景。
