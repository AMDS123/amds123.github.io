##### Abstract
In the age of social news, it is important to understand the types of reactions that are evoked from news sources with various levels of credibility. In the present work we seek to better understand how users react to trusted and deceptive news sources across two popular, and very different, social media platforms. To that end, (1) we develop a model to classify user reactions into one of nine types, such as answer, elaboration, and question, etc, and (2) we measure the speed and the type of reaction for trusted and deceptive news sources for 10.8M Twitter posts and 6.2M Reddit comments. We show that there are significant differences in the speed and the type of reactions between trusted and deceptive news sources on Twitter, but far smaller differences on Reddit.

在社会新闻时代，了解各种可信度的新闻来源引发的反应类型是很重要的。在目前的工作中，我们试图更好地理解用户如何对两个流行且非常不同的社交媒体平台上的可信和欺骗性新闻来源做出反应。为此，（1）我们开发了一个模型，将用户反应分为九种类型之一，例如答案，细化和问题等;（2）我们衡量速度和对可信和欺骗性新闻的反应类型10.8M Twitter帖子和6.2M Reddit评论的来源。我们发现在Twitter上可信和欺骗新闻来源之间的反应速度和反应类型存在显着差异，但在Reddit上的差异要小得多。
