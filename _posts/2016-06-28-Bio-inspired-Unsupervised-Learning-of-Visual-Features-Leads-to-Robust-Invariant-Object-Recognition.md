##### Abstract
Retinal image of surrounding objects varies tremendously due to the changes in position, size, pose, illumination condition, background context, occlusion, noise, and nonrigid deformations. But despite these huge variations, our visual system is able to invariantly recognize any object in just a fraction of a second. To date, various computational models have been proposed to mimic the hierarchical processing of the ventral visual pathway, with limited success. Here, we show that the association of both biologically inspired network architecture and learning rule significantly improves the models' performance when facing challenging invariant object recognition problems. Our model is an asynchronous feedforward spiking neural network. When the network is presented with natural images, the neurons in the entry layers detect edges, and the most activated ones fire first, while neurons in higher layers are equipped with spike timing-dependent plasticity. These neurons progressively become selective to intermediate complexity visual features appropriate for object categorization. The model is evaluated on 3D-Object and ETH-80 datasets which are two benchmarks for invariant object recognition, and is shown to outperform state-of-the-art models, including DeepConvNet and HMAX. This demonstrates its ability to accurately recognize different instances of multiple object classes even under various appearance conditions (different views, scales, tilts, and backgrounds). Several statistical analysis techniques are used to show that our model extracts class specific and highly informative features.

由于位置，大小，姿势，照明条件，背景环境，遮挡，噪声和非刚性变形的变化，周围物体的视网膜图像变化很大。但是，尽管这些巨大的变化，我们的视觉系统能够在几分之一秒内不变地识别任何物体。迄今为止，已经提出了各种计算模型来模仿腹侧视觉路径的分层处理，但是有限的成功。在这里，我们表明，生物启发式网络体系结构和学习规则的关联在面对具有挑战性的不变对象识别问题时显着提高模型的性能。我们的模型是一个异步前馈尖峰神经网络。当网络呈现自然图像时，入口层的神经元检测到边缘，最激活的神经元先激发，而更高层的神经元则具有尖峰时间相关的可塑性。这些神经元逐渐成为适合于对象分类的中等复杂度视觉特征的选择。该模型在3D-Object和ETH-80数据集上进行评估，该数据集是用于不变对象识别的两个基准，其性能优于DeepConvNet和HMAX等最先进的模型。这证明了即使在不同的外观条件（不同的视图，尺度，倾斜和背景）下，它也能精确地识别多个对象类的不同实例。几种统计分析技术被用来表明我们的模型提取了特定类别和高度信息的特征。
