##### Abstract
In this paper, we propose a novel face feature extraction method based on deep learning. Using synthesized multi-view face images, we train a deep face feature (DFF) extractor based on the correlation between projections of a face point on images from different views. A feature vector can be extracted for each pixel of the face image based on the trained DFF model, and it is more effective than general purpose feature descriptors for face-related tasks such as alignment, matching, and reconstruction. Based on the DFF, we develop an effective face alignment method with single or multiple face images as input, which iteratively updates landmarks, pose and 3D shape. Experiments demonstrate that our method can achieve state-of-the-art results for face alignment with a single image, and the alignment can be further improved with multi-view face images.

在本文中，我们提出了一种基于深度学习的人脸特征提取方法。使用合成的多视点人脸图像，根据不同视点图像上脸点投影之间的相关性，训练出一个深度人脸特征（DFF）提取器。基于训练的DFF模型，可以为人脸图像的每个像素提取一个特征向量，对比于面向相关任务（如对齐，匹配和重构）的通用特征描述符更有效。基于DFF，我们开发了一种有效的单人或多人脸图像对齐方法作为输入，迭代更新地标，姿态和三维形状。实验证明，我们的方法可以获得单个图像的人脸对齐的最新结果，并且可以利用多视图人脸图像进一步改善对齐。
