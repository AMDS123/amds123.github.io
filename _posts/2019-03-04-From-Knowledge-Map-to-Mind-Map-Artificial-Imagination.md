##### Abstract
Imagination is one of the most important factors which makes an artistic painting unique and impressive. With the rapid development of Artificial Intelligence, more and more researchers try to create painting with AI technology automatically. However, lacking of imagination is still a main problem for AI painting. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to inject rich imagination into a special painting art Mind Map creation. We firstly consider lexical and phonological similarities of seed word, then learn and inherit original painting style of the author, and finally apply Dadaism and impossibility of improvisation principles into painting process. We also design several metrics for imagination evaluation. Experimental results show that our proposed method can increase imagination of painting and also improve its overall quality.
