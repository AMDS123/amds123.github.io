##### Abstract
Face recall is a basic human cognitive process performed routinely, e.g., when meeting someone and determining if we have met that person before. Assisting a subject during face recall by suggesting candidate faces can be challenging. One of the reasons is that the search space - the face space - is quite large and lacks structure. A commercial application of face recall is facial composite systems - such as Identikit, PhotoFIT, and CD-FIT - where a witness searches for an image of a face that resembles his memory of a particular offender. The inherent uncertainty and cost in the evaluation of the objective function, the large size and lack of structure of the search space, and the unavailability of the gradient concept makes this problem inappropriate for traditional optimization methods. In this paper we propose a novel evolutionary approach for searching the face space that can be used as a facial composite system. The approach is inspired by methods of Bayesian optimization and differs from other applications in the use of the skew-normal distribution as its acquisition function. This choice of acquisition function provides greater granularity, with regularized, conservative, and realistic results.

##### Abstract (translated by Google)
面部回忆是常规进行的基本人类认知过程，例如，遇到某人并确定我们是否曾经遇见过这个人。通过建议候选人面孔协助面部召回过程中的主题可能具有挑战性。其中一个原因就是搜索空间 - 面部空间 - 相当大，缺乏结构。面部召回的商业应用是面部复合系统 - 例如Identikit，PhotoFIT和CD-FIT--其中证人搜索面部图像，类似于他对特定罪犯的记忆。目标函数评估的固有不确定性和代价，搜索空间的大小和结构的不足以及梯度概念的不可用性使得这个问题不适合传统的优化方法。在本文中，我们提出了一种新颖的进化方法来搜索可用作面部复合系统的面部空间。该方法受贝叶斯优化方法的启发，并且与使用偏斜正态分布作为其采集功能的其他应用不同。采集功能的这种选择提供了更大的粒度，具有正规化，保守和现实的结果。
