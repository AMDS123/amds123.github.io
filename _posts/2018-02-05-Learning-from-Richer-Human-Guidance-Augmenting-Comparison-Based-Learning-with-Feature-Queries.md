##### Abstract
We focus on learning the desired objective function for a robot. Although trajectory demonstrations can be very informative of the desired objective, they can also be difficult for users to provide. Answers to comparison queries, asking which of two trajectories is preferable, are much easier for users, and have emerged as an effective alternative. Unfortunately, comparisons are far less informative. We propose that there is much richer information that users can easily provide and that robots ought to leverage. We focus on augmenting comparisons with feature queries, and introduce a unified formalism for treating all answers as observations about the true desired reward. We derive an active query selection algorithm, and test these queries in simulation and on real users. We find that richer, feature-augmented queries can extract more information faster, leading to robots that better match user preferences in their behavior.

我们专注于学习机器人所需的目标函数。虽然轨迹演示可以提供非常有用的信息，但用户也很难提供。比较查询的答案，询问两个轨迹中的哪一个更可取，对于用户来说更容易，并且已经成为一种有效的替代方案。不幸的是，比较的信息要少得多。我们建议用户可以提供更丰富的信息，机器人应该利用这些信息。我们专注于增加与特征查询的比较，并引入一个统一的形式来处理所有的答案，作为对真正期望的奖励的观察。我们推导出一个主动的查询选择算法，并在模拟和真实用户中测试这些查询。我们发现更丰富，功能更强大的查询可以更快地提取更多信息，从而导致机器人更好地匹配用户的行为偏好。
