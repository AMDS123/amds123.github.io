##### Abstract
Requirements traceability is an essential step in ensuring the quality of software during the early stages of its development life cycle. Requirements tracing usually consists of document parsing, candidate link generation and evaluation and traceability analysis. This paper demonstrates the applicability of Statistical Term Extraction metrics to generate candidate links. It is applied and validated using two data sets and four types of filters two for each data set, 0.2 and 0.25 for MODIS, 0 and 0.05 for CM1. This method generates requirements traceability matrices between textual requirements artifacts (such as high-level requirements traced to low-level requirements). The proposed method includes ten word frequency metrics divided into three main groups for calculating the frequency of terms. The results show that the proposed method gives better result when compared with the traditional TF-IDF method.

需求可追溯性是在开发生命周期的早期阶段确保软件质量的关键步骤。需求跟踪通常包括文档解析，候选链接生成以及评估和可追溯性分析。本文演示统计术语提取度量标准生成候选链接的适用性。使用两个数据集和四种类型的过滤器对每个数据集应用和验证，对于每个数据集，0.2和0.25，对于CM1，0和0.05。此方法在文本需求工件（如跟踪到低级需求的高级需求）之间生成需求跟踪矩阵。所提出的方法包括10个词频度量，分为三个主要组，用于计算词条的频率。结果表明，与传统的TF-IDF方法相比，该方法效果较好。
