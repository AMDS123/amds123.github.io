##### Abstract
Image quality assessment (IQA) continues to garner great interest in the research community, particularly given the tremendous rise in consumer video capture and streaming. Despite significant research effort in IQA in the past few decades, the area of no-reference image quality assessment remains a great challenge and is largely unsolved. In this paper, we propose a novel no-reference image quality assessment system called Deep Quality, which leverages the power of deep learning to model the complex relationship between visual content and the perceived quality. Deep Quality consists of a novel multi-scale deep convolutional neural network, trained to learn to assess image quality based on training samples consisting of different distortions and degradations such as blur, Gaussian noise, and compression artifacts. Preliminary results using the CSIQ benchmark image quality dataset showed that Deep Quality was able to achieve strong quality prediction performance (89% patch-level and 98% image-level prediction accuracy), being able to achieve similar performance as full-reference IQA methods.

图像质量评估（IQA）继续引起研究界的极大兴趣，尤其是考虑到消费者视频采集和流媒体的巨大增长。尽管在过去的几十年中，IQA的研究工作非常重要，但无参考图像质量评估领域依然是一个巨大的挑战，而且在很大程度上还没有解决。在本文中，我们提出了一种新的非参考图像质量评估系统，称为深质量，它利用深度学习的力量来建模视觉内容和感知质量之间的复杂关系。深度质量由一个新颖的多尺度深度卷积神经网络组成，训练学习基于训练样本来评估图像质量，所述训练样本包括不同的失真和降级，例如模糊，高斯噪声和压缩伪影。使用CSIQ基准图像质量数据集的初步结果显示，Deep Quality能够实现强大的质量预测性能（89％的补丁级别和98％的图像级别预测准确性），能够实现与全参考IQA方法类似的性能。
