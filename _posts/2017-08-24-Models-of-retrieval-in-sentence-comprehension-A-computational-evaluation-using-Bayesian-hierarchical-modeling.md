##### Abstract
Research on interference has provided evidence that the formation of dependencies between non-adjacent words relies on a cue-based retrieval mechanism. Two different models can account for one of the main predictions of interference, i.e., a slowdown at a retrieval site, when several items share a feature associated with a retrieval cue: Lewis and Vasishth's (2005) activation-based model and McElree's (2000) direct access model. Even though these two models have been used almost interchangeably, they are based on different assumptions and predict differences in the relationship between reading times and response accuracy. The activation-based model follows the assumptions of ACT-R, and its retrieval process behaves as a lognormal race between accumulators of evidence with a single variance. Under this model, accuracy of the retrieval is determined by the winner of the race and retrieval time by its rate of accumulation. In contrast, the direct access model assumes a model of memory where only the probability of retrieval varies between items; in this model, differences in latencies are a by-product of the possibility and repairing incorrect retrievals. We implemented both models in a Bayesian hierarchical framework in order to evaluate them and compare them. We show that some aspects of the data are better fit under the direct access model than under the activation-based model. We suggest that this finding does not rule out the possibility that retrieval may be behaving as a race model with assumptions that follow less closely the ones from the ACT-R framework. We show that by introducing a modification of the activation model, i.e, by assuming that the accumulation of evidence for retrieval of incorrect items is not only slower but noisier (i.e., different variances for the correct and incorrect items), the model can provide a fit as good as the one of the direct access model.

干扰研究提供证据表明，非相邻词之间的依赖关系的形成依赖于基于提示的检索机制。两个不同的模型可以说明干扰的主要预测之一，即在一个检索点放缓，当几个项目共享一个与检索线索相关的特征：Lewis和Vasishth（2005）激活模型和McElree（2000）直接访问模式。尽管这两个模型几乎可以互换使用，但它们是基于不同的假设，并预测了阅读时间与响应准确度之间的关系差异。基于激活的模型遵循ACT-R的假设，其检索过程表现为具有单一方差的证据累加器之间的对数正态竞争。在这个模型下，检索的准确性由竞赛获胜者和检索时间以其积累率来确定。相比之下，直接访问模型假设一个内存模型，其中只有检索的概率因项目而异;在这个模型中，潜伏期的差异是可能性的副产品，并修复不正确的检索。我们在贝叶斯分层框架中实现了两个模型，以评估它们并进行比较。我们表明，在直接访问模型下，数据的某些方面比基于激活的模型更适合。我们认为，这一发现并不排除检索可能作为种族模式行事的可能性，其假设与ACT-R框架中的假设不太一致。我们表明，通过引入修改激活模型，即通过假设检索不正确的项目的证据的积累不仅是较慢但噪音较大（即正确和不正确的项目的不同的差异），该模型可以提供适合直接访问模式。
