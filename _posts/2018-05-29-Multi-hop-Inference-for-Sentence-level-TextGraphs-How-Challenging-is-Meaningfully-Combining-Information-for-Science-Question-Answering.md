##### Abstract
Question Answering for complex questions is often modeled as a graph construction or traversal task, where a solver must build or traverse a graph of facts that answer and explain a given question. This "multi-hop" inference has been shown to be extremely challenging, with few models able to aggregate more than two facts before being overwhelmed by "semantic drift", or the tendency for long chains of facts to quickly drift off topic. This is a major barrier to current inference models, as even elementary science questions require an average of 4 to 6 facts to answer and explain. In this work we empirically characterize the difficulty of building or traversing a graph of sentences connected by lexical overlap, by evaluating chance sentence aggregation quality through 9,784 manually-annotated judgments across knowledge graphs built from three free-text corpora (including study guides and Simple Wikipedia). We demonstrate semantic drift tends to be high and aggregation quality low, at between 0.04% and 3%, and highlight scenarios that maximize the likelihood of meaningfully combining information.

##### Abstract (translated by Google)
问题对于复杂问题的回答通常被模拟为一个图表构造或遍历任务，解算者必须构建或遍历一个回答和解释给定问题的事实图。这种“多跳”推断已被证明是极具挑战性的，很少有模型能够在被“语义漂移”所淹没之前汇总两个以上的事实，或者长链事实快速偏离主题的倾向。这是当前推理模型的主要障碍，因为即使是基础科学问题也需要平均4至6个事实来回答和解释。在这项工作中，我们通过9784个由三个自由文本语料库（包括学习指南和简单维基百科）构建的知识图中的手动注释判断来评估机会语句聚集质量，从而凭经验确定构建或遍历由词汇重叠连接的句子的图表的难度）。我们证明语义漂移往往很高，聚集质量低，介于0.04％和3％之间，并强调最大限度地有意识地组合信息的可能性。
