##### Abstract
Previous approaches to model and analyze facial expression analysis use three different techniques: facial action units, geometric features and graph based modelling. However, previous approaches have treated these technique separately. There is an interrelationship between these techniques. The facial expression analysis is significantly improved by utilizing these mappings between major geometric features involved in facial expressions and the subset of facial action units whose presence or absence are unique to a facial expression. This paper combines dimension reduction techniques and image classification with search space pruning achieved by this unique subset of facial action units to significantly prune the search space. The performance results on the publicly facial expression database shows an improvement in performance by 70% over time while maintaining the emotion recognition correctness.

##### Abstract (translated by Google)
以前的模型和分析面部表情分析的方法使用三种不同的技术：面部动作单元，几何特征和基于图形的建模。但是，以前的方法已经分别处理这些技术。这些技术之间有一个相互关系。通过利用脸部表情中涉及的主要几何特征和脸部动作单元的子集（脸部动作单元的存在或不存在对于面部表情来说是唯一的）之间的这些映射来显着改善面部表情分析。本文将降​​维技术和图像分类技术相结合，通过面部动作单元的独特子集实现搜索空间裁剪，显着修剪搜索空间。在公开的面部表情数据库上的表现结果显示，在保持情绪识别正确性的同时，在时间上性能提高了70％。
