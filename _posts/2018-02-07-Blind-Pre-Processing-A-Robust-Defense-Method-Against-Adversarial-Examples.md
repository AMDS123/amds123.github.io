##### Abstract
Deep learning algorithms and networks are vulnerable to perturbed inputs which is known as the adversarial attack. Many defense methodologies have been investigated to defend against such adversarial attack. In this work, we propose a novel methodology to defend the existing powerful attack model. We for the first time introduce a new attacking scheme for the attacker and set a practical constraint for white box attack. Under this proposed attacking scheme, we present the best defense ever reported against some of the recent strong attacks. It consists of a set of nonlinear function to process the input data which will make it more robust over the adversarial attack. However, we make this processing layer completely hidden from the attacker. Blind pre-processing improves the white box attack accuracy of MNIST from 94.3\% to 98.7\%. Even with increasing defense when others defenses completely fail, blind pre-processing remains one of the strongest ever reported. Another strength of our defense is that it eliminates the need for adversarial training as it can significantly increase the MNIST accuracy without adversarial training as well. Additionally, blind pre-processing can also increase the inference accuracy in the face of a powerful attack on CIFAR-10 and SVHN data set as well without much sacrificing clean data accuracy.

深度学习算法和网络容易受到扰动的输入，这被称为敌对攻击。已经调查了许多防御方法来防御这种对抗性攻击。在这项工作中，我们提出了一种新的方法来捍卫现有的强大的攻击模式。我们首次为攻击者引入新的攻击方式，为白盒攻击设定了一个实际的约束。根据这个建议的攻击计划，我们提出了有史以来最好的防御，反对最近的一些强烈攻击。它由一组非线性函数组成，用于处理输入数据，这将使其在敌对攻击中更加稳健。但是，我们使这个处理层对攻击者完全隐藏。盲预处理将MNIST的白盒攻击准确率从94.3％提高到98.7％。即使在防御力增加的情况下，其他防御措施完全失败，盲目的预处理仍然是有史以来最强的报告之一。我们防守的另一个优势在于消除了对抗性训练的需要，因为它可以显着提高MNIST的准确性而无需进行对抗训练。此外，盲目的预处理还可以在CIFAR-10和SVHN数据集面临强大的攻击时提高推断的准确性，而不会牺牲清晰的数据精度。
