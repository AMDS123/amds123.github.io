##### Abstract
Some geometric properties of the wavelet analysis performed by visual neurons are discussed and compared with experimental data. In particular, several relationships between the cortical morphologies and the parametric dependencies of extracted features are formalized and considered from a harmonic analysis point of view.

##### Abstract (translated by Google)
讨论了视觉神经元进行的小波分析的几何特性，并与实验数据进行了比较。特别是，皮层形态和提取特征的参数依赖关系之间的几种关系被形式化，并从谐波分析的角度来考虑。
