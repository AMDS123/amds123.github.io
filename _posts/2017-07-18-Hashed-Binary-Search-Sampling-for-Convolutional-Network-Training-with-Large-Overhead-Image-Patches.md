##### Abstract
Very large overhead imagery associated with ground truth maps has the potential to generate billions of training image patches for machine learning algorithms. However, random sampling selection criteria often leads to redundant and noisy-image patches for model training. With minimal research efforts behind this challenge, the current status spells missed opportunities to develop supervised learning algorithms that generalize over wide geographical scenes. In addition, much of the computational cycles for large scale machine learning are poorly spent crunching through noisy and redundant image patches. We demonstrate a potential framework to address these challenges specifically, while evaluating a human settlement detection task. A novel binary search tree sampling scheme is fused with a kernel based hashing procedure that maps image patches into hash-buckets using binary codes generated from image content. The framework exploits inherent redundancy within billions of image patches to promote mostly high variance preserving samples for accelerating algorithmic training and increasing model generalization.

与地面实况地图相关的非常大的开销图像有可能为机器学习算法产生数十亿个训练图像块。然而，随机抽样选择标准往往导致模型训练的冗余和噪声图像补丁。尽管在这个挑战背后的研究努力最小，目前的状态法则错过了发展监督学习算法的机会，这些算法在广泛的地理场景上进行概括。另外，大规模机器学习的大部分计算周期在嘈杂冗余的图像补丁上花费很少。我们展示了一个潜在的框架来解决这些具体挑战，同时评估人类住区检测任务。一种新型的二叉搜索树抽样方案与基于内核的散列程序融合，该程序使用从图像内容生成的二进制码将图像块映射到散列桶中。该框架利用数十亿图像块内的固有冗余来促进大多数高方差保存样本以加速算法训练并增加模型泛化。
