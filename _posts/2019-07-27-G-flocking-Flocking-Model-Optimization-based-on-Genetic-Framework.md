##### Abstract
Flocking model has been widely used to control robotic swarm. However, with the increasing scalability, there exist complex conflicts for robotic swarm in autonomous navigation, brought by internal pattern maintenance, external environment changes, and target area orientation, which results in poor stability and adaptability. Hence, optimizing the flocking model for robotic swarm in autonomous navigation is an important and meaningful research domain.
