##### Abstract
Machine Learning is proving invaluable across disciplines. However, its successis often limited by the quality and quantity of available data, while its adoption by the level of trust that models afford users. Human vs. machine performance is commonly compared empirically to decide whether a certain task should be performed by a computer or an expert. In reality, the optimal learning strategy may involve combining the complementary strengths of man and machine. Here we present Expert-Augmented Machine Learning(EAML), an automated method that guides the extraction ofexpert knowledgeand its integration intomachine-learned models. We use a large dataset of intensive care patient data to predict mortality and show that we can extract expert knowledge using an online platform, help reveal hidden confounders, improve generalizability ona different population and learn using less data. EAML presents a novel framework for high performance and dependable machine learning in critical applications.
