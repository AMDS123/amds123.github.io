##### Abstract
In this work, we consider the image super-resolution (SR) problem. The main challenge of image SR is to recover high-frequency details of a low-resolution (LR) image that are important for human perception. To address this essentially ill-posed problem, we introduce a Deep Edge Guided REcurrent rEsidual~(DEGREE) network to progressively recover the high-frequency details. Different from most of existing methods that aim at predicting high-resolution (HR) images directly, DEGREE investigates an alternative route to recover the difference between a pair of LR and HR images by recurrent residual learning. DEGREE further augments the SR process with edge-preserving capability, namely the LR image and its edge map can jointly infer the sharp edge details of the HR image during the recurrent recovery process. To speed up its training convergence rate, by-pass connections across multiple layers of DEGREE are constructed. In addition, we offer an understanding on DEGREE from the view-point of sub-band frequency decomposition on image signal and experimentally demonstrate how DEGREE can recover different frequency bands separately. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets clearly demonstrate the superiority of DEGREE over well-established baselines and DEGREE also provides new state-of-the-arts on these datasets.

在这项工作中，我们考虑图像超分辨率（SR）问题。图像SR的主要挑战是恢复对人类感知重要的低分辨率（LR）图像的高频细节。为了解决这个本质上不适合的问题，我们引入了一个深度边缘引导的现有个人网络（DEGREE）来逐步恢复高频细节。与大多数旨在直接预测高分辨率（HR）图像的方法不同，DEGREE研究了通过循环残差学习来恢复一对LR和HR图像之间差异的替代路线。 DEGREE进一步增强了具有边缘保留能力的SR过程，即LR图像及其边缘图可以共同推断出复发过程中HR图像的尖锐边缘细节。为了加快训练收敛速度，构建了多个DEGREE层的旁路连接。另外，从图像信号的子带频率分解的角度出发，对DEGREE进行了理解，并通过实验证明了DEGREE是如何分别恢复不同的频带的。在三个基准数据集上的大量实验清楚地证明了DEGREE优于已建立的基线的优越性，而DEGREE也为这些数据集提供了新的技术水平。
