##### Abstract
The Digital Ludeme Project (DLP) aims to reconstruct and analyse over 1000 traditional strategy games using modern techniques. One of the key aspects of this project is the development of Ludii, a general game system that will be able to model and play the complete range of games required by this project. Such an undertaking will create a wide range of possibilities for new AI challenges. In this paper we describe many of the features of Ludii that can be used. This includes designing and modifying games using the Ludii game description language, creating agents capable of playing these games, and several advantages the system has over prior general game software.
