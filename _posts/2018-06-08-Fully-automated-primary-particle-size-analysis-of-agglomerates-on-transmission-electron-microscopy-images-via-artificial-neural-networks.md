##### Abstract
There is a high demand for fully automated methods for the analysis of primary particle size distributions of agglomerates on transmission electron microscopy images. Therefore, a novel method, based on the utilization of artificial neural networks, was proposed, implemented and validated. The training of the artificial neural networks requires large quantities (up to several hundreds of thousands) of transmission electron microscopy images of agglomerates consisting of primary particles with known sizes. Since the manual evaluation of such large amounts of transmission electron microscopy images is not feasible, a synthesis of lifelike transmission electron microscopy images as training data was implemented. The proposed method can compete with state-of-the-art automated imaging particle size methods like the Hough transformation, ultimate erosion and watershed transformation and is in some cases even able to outperform these methods. It is however still outperformed by the manual analysis.

##### Abstract (translated by Google)
对透射电子显微镜图像上附聚物的初级粒度分布的分析的全自动方法有很高的要求。因此，提出并实施了一种基于人工神经网络的新方法。人造神经网络的训练需要大量（高达数十万）透射电子显微镜图像，其由具有已知尺寸的初级粒子组成的附聚物。由于人工评估这样大量的透射电子显微镜图像是不可行的，因此实施了作为训练数据的逼真的透射电子显微镜图像的合成。所提出的方法可以与诸如霍夫变换，最终侵蚀和分水岭变换之类的最先进的自动成像粒度方法相竞争，并且在某些情况下甚至能够胜过这些方法。然而，手动分析仍然跑赢大盘。
