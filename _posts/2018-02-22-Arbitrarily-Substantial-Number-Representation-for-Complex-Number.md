##### Abstract
Researchers are often perplexed when their machine learning algorithms are required to deal with complex number. Various strategies are commonly employed to project complex number into real number, although it is frequently sacrificing the information contained in the complex number. This paper proposes a new method and four techniques to represent complex number as real number, without having to sacrifice the information contained. The proposed techniques are also capable of retrieving the original complex number from the representing real number, with little to none of information loss. The promising applicability of the proposed techniques has been demonstrated and worth to receive further exploration in representing the complex number.

当他们的机器学习算法需要处理复数时，研究人员常常感到困惑。通常采用各种策略将复数编号为实数，尽管它经常牺牲复数中包含的信息。本文提出了一种新方法和四种技术将复数表示为实数，而不必牺牲所包含的信息。所提出的技术还能够从代表实数中检索原始复数，几乎没有信息损失。已经证明了所提出的技术的有前景的适用性，并且值得在表示复数时进一步探索。
