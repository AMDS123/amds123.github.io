##### Abstract
Despite the remarkable success of modern monocular depth estimation methods, the accuracy achievable from a single image is limited, making it is practically useful to incorporate other sources of depth information. Currently, depth estimation from different combinations of sources are treated as different applications, and solved via separate networks trained to use the set of available sources as input for each application. In this paper, we propose a common versatile model that outputs a probability distribution over scene depth given an input color image, as a sample approximation using outputs from a conditional GAN. This distributional output is useful even in the monocular setting, and can be used to estimate depth, pairwise ordering, etc. More importantly, these outputs can be combined with a variety of other depth cues---such as user guidance and partial measurements---for use in different application settings, without retraining. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach through experiments on the NYUv2 dataset for a number of tasks, and find that our results from a common model, trained only once, are comparable to those from state-of-the-art methods with separate task-specific models.
