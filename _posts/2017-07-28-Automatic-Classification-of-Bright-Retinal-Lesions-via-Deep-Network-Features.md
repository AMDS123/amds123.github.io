##### Abstract
The diabetic retinopathy is timely diagonalized through color eye fundus images by experienced ophthalmologists, in order to recognize potential retinal features and identify early-blindness cases. In this paper, it is proposed to extract deep features from the last fully-connected layer of, four different, pre-trained convolutional neural networks. These features are then feeded into a non-linear classifier to discriminate three-class diabetic cases, i.e., normal, exudates, and drusen. Averaged across 1113 color retinal images collected from six publicly available annotated datasets, the deep features approach perform better than the classical bag-of-words approach. The proposed approaches have an average accuracy between 91.23% and 92.00% with more than 13% improvement over the traditional state of art methods.

为了识别潜在的视网膜特征和识别早期失明病例，通过经验丰富的眼科医生通过彩色眼底图像及时对角化糖尿病视网膜病变。本文提出从四个不同的预训练卷积神经网络的最后一个完全连接层中提取深度特征。然后将这些特征加入到非线性分类器中以区分三类糖尿病病例，即正常，渗出物和玻璃疣。从6个公开可用的带注释的数据集中收集的1113个彩色视网膜图像平均值，深度特征方法的表现优于传统的词袋方法。所提出的方法的平均准确度在91.23％和92.00％之间，比传统的现有技术方法提高了13％以上。
