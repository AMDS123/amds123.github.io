##### Abstract
Coalescence overgrowth of pattern-grown GaN nanocolumns (NC) on c-plane sapphire substrate with metal organic chemical vapour deposition is demonstrated. The subsequent coalescence overgrowth opens a possibility for dislocation reduction due to the lateral strain relaxation in columnar geometry. We present further growth optimization and innovative characterization of MOCVD layers, overgrown on the columnar structure with varying diameter of colums. Nanoimprint lithography was applied to open circular holes of 250, 300, 450, 600 nm in diameter on the SiO2 layer, deposited on the GaN layer on c-plane sapphire template.
