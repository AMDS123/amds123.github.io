##### Abstract
Numerous, artificially intelligent, networked things will populate the battlefield of the future, operating in close collaboration with human warfighters, and fighting as teams in highly adversarial environments. This chapter explores the characteristics, capabilities and intelli-gence required of such a network of intelligent things and humans - Internet of Battle Things (IOBT). The IOBT will experience unique challenges that are not yet well addressed by the current generation of AI and machine learning.
