##### Abstract
Most of the internet today is composed of digital media that includes videos and images. With pixels becoming the currency in which most transactions happen on the internet, it is becoming increasingly important to have a way of browsing through this ocean of information with relative ease. YouTube has 400 hours of video uploaded every minute and many million images are browsed on Instagram, Facebook, etc. Inspired by recent advances in the field of deep learning and success that it has gained on various problems like image captioning and, machine translation , word2vec , skip thoughts, etc, we present DeepSeek a natural language processing based deep learning model that allows users to enter a description of the kind of images that they want to search, and in response the system retrieves all the images that semantically and contextually relate to the query. Two approaches are described in the following sections.

今天的大多数互联网都是由包含视频和图像的数字媒体组成的。随着像素成为互联网上大多数交易发生的货币，通过相对容易的方式浏览信息海洋变得越来越重要。 YouTube每分钟上传视频长达400小时，在Instagram，Facebook等平台上浏览了数百万的图片。受到深度学习和成功领域的最新进展的启发，它在图像字幕和机器翻译等各种问题上获得了成功，word2vec ，跳过想法等，我们展示DeepSeek基于自然语言处理的深度学习模型，允许用户输入他们想要搜索的图像种类的描述，并且作为响应，系统检索语义上和上下文相关的所有图像查询。以下部分介绍了两种方法。
