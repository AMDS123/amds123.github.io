##### Abstract
It is well known that speaker verification systems are subject to spoofing attacks. The Automatic Speaker Verification Spoofing and Countermeasures Challenge -- ASVSpoof2015 -- provides a standard spoofing database, containing attacks based on synthetic speech, along with a protocol for experiments. This paper describes CPqD's systems submitted to the ASVSpoof2015 Challenge, based on deep neural networks, working both as a classifier and as a feature extraction module for a GMM and a SVM classifier. Results show the validity of this approach, achieving less than 0.5\% EER for known attacks.

说话者验证系统受到欺骗攻击是众所周知的。自动说话人验证欺骗和对策挑战 -  ASVSpoof2015  - 提供了一个标准的欺骗数据库，包含基于合成语音的攻击以及一个实验协议。本文描述了基于深度神经网络提交给ASVSpoof2015挑战的CPqD系统，既可以作为分类器，也可以作为GMM和SVM分类器的特征提取模块。结果显示了这种方法的有效性，对于已知的攻击实现小于0.5％的EER。
