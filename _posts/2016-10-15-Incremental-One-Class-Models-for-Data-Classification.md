##### Abstract
In this paper we outline a PhD research plan. This research contributes to the field of one-class incremental learning and classification in case of non-stationary environments. The goal of this PhD is to define a new classification framework able to deal with very small learning dataset at the beginning of the process and with abilities to adjust itself according to the variability of the incoming data which create large scale datasets. As a preliminary work, incremental Covariance-guided One-Class Support Vector Machine is proposed to deal with sequentially obtained data. It is inspired from COSVM which put more emphasis on the low variance directions while keeping the basic formulation of incremental One-Class Support Vector Machine untouched. The incremental procedure is introduced by controlling the possible changes of support vectors after the addition of new data points, thanks to the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker conditions, that have to be maintained on all previously acquired data. Comparative experimental results with contemporary incremental and non-incremental one-class classifiers on numerous artificial and real data sets show that our method results in significantly better classification performance.

在本文中，我们概述了一个博士研究计划。这个研究有助于在非平稳环境下的一类增量学习和分类领域。该博士的目标是定义一个新的分类框架，能够在流程开始时处理非常小的学习数据集，并根据创建大规模数据集的输入数据的可变性自行调整自身。作为前期工作，提出了增量协方差引导的一类支持向量机处理顺序获得的数据。它是从COSVM中得到启发，在保持增量式一类支持向量机的基本表达不变的情况下，更重视低方差方向。通过控制增加新数据点之后支持向量的可能变化来引入增量过程，这要归功于Karush-Kuhn-Tucker条件，必须在所有先前获得的数据上保留这些条件。与众多人工和实际数据集上的现代增量和非增量单类分类器的比较实验结果表明，我们的方法导致显着更好的分类性能。
