##### Abstract
In recent times, the availability of inexpensive image capturing devices such as smartphones/tablets has led to an exponential increase in the number of images/videos captured. However, sometimes the amateur photographer is hindered by fences in the scene which have to be removed after the image has been captured. Conventional approaches to image de-fencing suffer from inaccurate and non-robust fence detection apart from being limited to processing images of only static occluded scenes. In this paper, we propose a semi-automated de-fencing algorithm using a video of the dynamic scene. We use convolutional neural networks for detecting fence pixels. We provide qualitative as well as quantitative comparison results with existing lattice detection algorithms on the existing PSU NRT data set and a proposed challenging fenced image dataset. The inverse problem of fence removal is solved using split Bregman technique assuming total variation of the de-fenced image as the regularization constraint.

近来，智能手机/平板电脑等廉价图像捕捉设备的可用性已导致捕捉的图像/视频数量呈指数级增长。然而，有时业余摄影师被场景中的栅栏阻挡，在拍摄图像后必须将其去除。除了仅限于处理静态遮挡场景的图像之外，用于防护图像的常规方法受到不准确和非鲁棒的围栏检测的影响。在本文中，我们提出了一种使用动态场景视频的半自动防护算法。我们使用卷积神经网络来检测栅栏像素。我们在现有的PSU NRT数据集和提出的具有挑战性的栅栏图像数据集上提供定性和定量比较结果，并与现有的网格检测算法进行比较。使用分裂布雷格曼技术来解决栅栏去除的逆问题，假设去栅栏图像的总变化作为正则化约束。
