##### Abstract
There is physiological evidence that our ability to interpret human pose and action from 2D visual imagery (binocular or monocular) engages the circuitry of the motor cortices as well as the visual areas of the brain. This implies that the capability of the motor cortices to solve inverse kinematics is flexible enough to apply to both motion planning as well as serving as a generative model for the visual processing of human figures, despite the differing functional requirements of the two tasks. This paper provides a computational model of the cooperation between visual and motor areas: in other words, a system view of an important class of brain computations. The model unifies the solution of the separate inverse problems involved in the task, visual transformation discovery, inverse kinematics, and adaptation to morphology variations, using several instances of the Map-seeking Circuit algorithm. While the paper is weighted toward the exposition of a neurobiological hypothesis, from mathematical formalization of the problem to neuronal circuitry, the algorithmic expression of the solution is also a functional machine vision system for human figure recognition, and 3D pose and body morphology reconstruction from monocular, perspective-less input imagery. With an inverse kinematic generative model capable of imposing a variety of endogenous and exogenous constraints the machine vision implementation acquires characteristics currently unique among such systems.

有生理学证据表明，我们从二维视觉图像（双眼或单眼）解释人体姿势和动作的能力涉及运动皮层的电路以及大脑的视觉区域。这意味着尽管两个任务有不同的功能要求，运动皮质解反向运动的能力足够灵活，既适用于运动规划，又可作为人体视觉处理的生成模型。本文提供了一个视觉和运动领域之间的合作计算模型：换句话说，一个重要的一类脑计算的系统观点。该模型结合了Map-seeking电路算法的几个实例，将任务中涉及的单独反问题，视觉变换发现，逆向运动学以及适应形态变化的方法统一起来。虽然论文的重点是对神经生物学假说的阐述，但是从问题的数学形式化到神经元电路，解的算法表达式也是一个用于人体图像识别的功能性机器视觉系统，以及从单眼，无透视输入图像。机器视觉实现具有能够施加各种内生和外生约束的反向运动生成模型，获得当前在这样的系统中独特的特征。
