##### Abstract
Network controllers (NCs) are devices that are capable of converting dynamic, spatially extended, and functionally specialized modules into a taskable goal-oriented group called networked control system. This paper examines the practical aspects of designing and building an NC that uses the Internet as a communication medium. It focuses on finding compatible controller components that can be integrated via a host structure in a manner that makes it possible to network, in real-time, a webcam, an unmanned ground vehicle (UGV), and a remote computer server along with the necessary operator software interface. The aim is to deskill the UGV navigation process and yet maintain a robust performance. The structure of the suggested controller, its components, and the manner in which they are interfaced are described. Thorough experimental results along with performance assessment and comparisons to a previously implemented NC are provided.

网络控制器（NC）是能够将动态的，空间扩展的和功能上专用的模块转换成可任务的目标导向组（称为联网控制系统）的设备。本文考察了设计和构建使用Internet作为通信媒介的NC的实际方面。其重点在于找到可以通过主机结构集成的兼容的控制器组件，使得能够实时地网络摄像头，无人地面车辆（UGV）和远程计算机服务器以及必要的网络操作员软件界面。其目标是为UGV导航流程提供服务，同时保持强劲的性能。描述了建议的控制器的结构，它的组件，以及它们所连接的方式。提供了彻底的实验结果以及性能评估和与先前实施的NC的比较。
