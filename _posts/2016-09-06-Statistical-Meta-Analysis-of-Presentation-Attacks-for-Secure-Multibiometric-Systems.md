##### Abstract
Prior work has shown that multibiometric systems are vulnerable to presentation attacks, assuming that their matching score distribution is identical to that of genuine users, without fabricating any fake trait. We have recently shown that this assumption is not representative of current fingerprint and face presentation attacks, leading one to overestimate the vulnerability of multibiometric systems, and to design less effective fusion rules. In this paper, we overcome these limitations by proposing a statistical meta-model of face and fingerprint presentation attacks that characterizes a wider family of fake score distributions, including distributions of known and, potentially, unknown attacks. This allows us to perform a thorough security evaluation of multibiometric systems against presentation attacks, quantifying how their vulnerability may vary also under attacks that are different from those considered during design, through an uncertainty analysis. We empirically show that our approach can reliably predict the performance of multibiometric systems even under never-before-seen face and fingerprint presentation attacks, and that the secure fusion rules designed using our approach can exhibit an improved trade-off between the performance in the absence and in the presence of attack. We finally argue that our method can be extended to other biometrics besides faces and fingerprints.

以前的工作表明，多生物特征识别系统很容易受到演示攻击，假设它们的匹配分数分布与真实用户的相同，而没有制造任何虚假的特征。我们最近已经表明，这个假设并不能代表当前的指纹和脸部表现攻击，导致人们高估了多生物特征识别系统的脆弱性，并设计出不太有效的融合规则。在本文中，我们通过提出面部和指纹展示攻击的统计元模型来克服这些局限性，该模型描述了更广泛的假分数分布族，包括已知和未知攻击的分布。这使我们能够针对演示文稿攻击对多生物特征识别系统进行全面的安全评估，并通过不确定性分析来量化其在与设计期间所考虑的攻击不同的攻击下的脆弱性。我们实验证明，我们的方法可以可靠地预测多生物特征系统的性能，即使在从未见过的面部和指纹表现攻击下，并且使用我们的方法设计的安全融合规则可以表现出改善的性能之间的折衷并在攻击的情况下。我们最后争辩说，我们的方法可以扩展到除脸部和指纹之外的其他生物特征。
