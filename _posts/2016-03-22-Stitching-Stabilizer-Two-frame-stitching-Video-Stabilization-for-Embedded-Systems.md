##### Abstract
In conventional electronic video stabilization, the stabilized frame is obtained by cropping the input frame to cancel camera shake. While a small cropping size results in strong stabilization, it does not provide us satisfactory results from the viewpoint of image quality, because it narrows the angle of view. By fusing several frames, we can effectively expand the area of input frames, and achieve strong stabilization even with a large cropping size. Several methods for doing so have been studied. However, their computational costs are too high for embedded systems such as smartphones. We propose a simple, yet surprisingly effective algorithm, called the stitching stabilizer. It stitches only two frames together with a minimal computational cost. It can achieve real-time processes in embedded systems, for Full HD and 30 FPS videos. To clearly show the effect, we apply it to hyperlapse. Using several clips, we show it produces more strongly stabilized and natural results than the existing solutions from Microsoft and Instagram.

在传统的电子视频稳定器中，通过裁剪输入帧来取消相机抖动来获得稳定的帧。虽然小的裁剪尺寸导致稳定性强，但是从图像质量的角度来看，它不能给我们提供满意的结果，因为它缩小了视角。通过融合多个帧，可以有效扩大输入帧的面积，即使在裁剪尺寸较大的情况下也能够实现较强的稳定性。已经研究了几种这样做的方法。但是，智能手机等嵌入式系统的计算成本太高。我们提出一个简单的，但令人惊讶的有效的算法，称为拼接稳定器。它只用最小的计算成本就能拼接两个帧。它可以在嵌入式系统中实现全高清和30 FPS视频的实时处理。为了清楚地显示效果，我们将其应用于hyperlapse。使用多个剪辑，我们发现它比微软和Instagram现有的解决方案产生更稳固和自然的结果。
