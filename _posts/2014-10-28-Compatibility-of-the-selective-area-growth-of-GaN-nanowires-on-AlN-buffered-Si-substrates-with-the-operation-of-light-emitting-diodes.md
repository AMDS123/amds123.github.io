##### Abstract
AlN layers with thicknesses between 2 and 14 nm were grown on Si(111) substrates by molecular beam epitaxy. The effect of the AlN layer thickness on the morphology and nucleation time of spontaneously formed GaN nanowires (NWs) was investigated by scanning electron microscopy and line-of-sight quadrupole mass spectrometry, respectively. We observed that the alignment of the NWs grown on these layers improves with increasing layer thickness while their nucleation time decreases. Our results show that 4 nm is the smallest thickness of the AlN layer that allows the growth of well-aligned NWs with short nucleation time. Such an AlN buffer layer was successfully employed, together with a patterned SiOx mask, for the selective-area growth (SAG) of vertical GaN NWs. In addition, we fabricated light-emitting diodes (LEDs) from NW ensembles that were grown by means of self-organization phenomena on bare and on AlN-buffered Si substrates. A careful characterization of the optoelectronic properties of the two devices showed that the performance of NW-LEDs on bare and AlN-buffered Si is similar. Electrical conduction across the AlN buffer is facilitated by a high number of grain boundaries that were revealed by transmission electron microscopy. These results demonstrate that grainy AlN buffer layers on Si are compatible both with the SAG of GaN NWs and LED operation. Therefore, this study is a first step towards the fabrication of LEDs on Si substrates based on homogeneous NW ensembles.

通过分子束外延在Si（111）衬底上生长厚度在2和14nm之间的AlN层。通过扫描电镜和视线四极质谱分别研究了AlN层厚度对自发形成的GaN纳米线（NW）的形貌和成核时间的影响。我们观察到在这些层上生长的NW的排列随着层厚的增加而提高，同时它们的成核时间减少。我们的研究结果表明，4nm是AlN层的最小厚度，允许成核时间短的良好排列的NW的生长。这种AlN缓冲层已成功地用于图案化的SiOx掩模，用于垂直GaN NWs的选择区域生长（SAG）。此外，我们还制作了由裸组合和裸AlN缓冲硅衬底上的自组织现象生成的NW组合发光二极管（LED）。对这两种器件的光电特性的仔细表征表明，在裸露和AlN缓冲硅上的NW-LED的性能是相似的。通过透射电子显微镜显示的大量晶界促进了AlN缓冲剂上的电传导。这些结果表明Si上的粒状AlN缓冲层与GaN NW和SAG的操作兼容。因此，本研究是在基于均匀NW组合的Si衬底上制造LED的第一步。
