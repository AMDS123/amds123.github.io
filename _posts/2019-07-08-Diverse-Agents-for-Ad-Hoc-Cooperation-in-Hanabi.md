##### Abstract
In complex scenarios where a model of other actors is necessary to predict and interpret their actions, it is often desirable that the model works well with a wide variety of previously unknown actors. Hanabi is a card game that brings the problem of modeling other players to the forefront, but there is no agreement on how to best generate a pool of agents to use as partners in ad-hoc cooperation evaluation. This paper proposes Quality Diversity algorithms as a promising class of algorithms to generate populations for this purpose and shows an initial implementation of an agent generator based on this idea. We also discuss what metrics can be used to compare such generators, and how the proposed generator could be leveraged to help build adaptive agents for the game.
