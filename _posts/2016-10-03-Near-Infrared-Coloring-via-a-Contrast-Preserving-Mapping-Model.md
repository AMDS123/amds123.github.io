##### Abstract
Near-infrared gray images captured together with corresponding visible color images have recently proven useful for image restoration and classification. This paper introduces a new coloring method to add colors to near-infrared gray images based on a contrast-preserving mapping model. A naive coloring method directly adds the colors from the visible color image to the near-infrared gray image; however, this method results in an unrealistic image because of the discrepancies in brightness and image structure between the captured near-infrared gray image and the visible color image. To solve the discrepancy problem, first we present a new contrast-preserving mapping model to create a new near-infrared gray image with a similar appearance in the luminance plane to the visible color image, while preserving the contrast and details of the captured near-infrared gray image. Then based on the proposed contrast-preserving mapping model, we develop a method to derive realistic colors that can be added to the newly created near-infrared gray image. Experimental results show that the proposed method can not only preserve the local contrasts and details of the captured near-infrared gray image, but transfers the realistic colors from the visible color image to the newly created near-infrared gray image. Experimental results also show that the proposed approach can be applied to near-infrared denoising.

近红外灰度图像与相应的可见彩色图像一起被捕获近来证明对于图像恢复和分类是有用的。本文介绍了一种基于对比度保持映射模型的新的着色方法，为近红外灰度图像添加颜色。天真的着色方法直接将可见彩色图像中的颜色添加到近红外灰度图像;然而，由于捕获的近红外灰度图像和可见彩色图像之间的亮度和图像结构的差异，该方法导致不切实际的图像。为了解决这个差异问题，首先我们提出一个新的对比度保持映射模型来创建一个新的近红外灰度图像，在亮度平面上与可见彩色图像具有相似的外观，同时保留所捕获的近红外图像的对比度和细节，红外灰色图像。然后，基于建议的对比度保持映射模型，我们开发了一种方法来导出逼真的颜色，可以添加到新创建的近红外灰度图像。实验结果表明，该方法不仅可以保留捕捉到的近红外灰度图像的局部对比度和细节信息，而且可以将真实的彩色图像从可见彩色图像转移到新建立的近红外灰度图像上。实验结果还表明，该方法可应用于近红外去噪。
