##### Abstract
A class of channels is introduced for which there is memory inside blocks of a specified length and no memory across the blocks. The multi-user model is called an information network with in-block memory (NiBM). It is shown that block-fading channels, channels with state known causally at the encoder, and relay networks with delays are NiBMs. A cut-set bound is developed for NiBMs that unifies, strengthens, and generalizes existing cut bounds for discrete memoryless networks. The bound gives new finite-letter capacity expressions for several classes of networks including point-to-point channels, and certain multiaccess, broadcast, and relay channels. Cardinality bounds on the random coding alphabets are developed that improve on existing bounds for channels with action-dependent state available causally at the encoder and for relays without delay. Finally, quantize-forward network coding is shown to achieve rates within an additive gap of the new cut-set bound for linear, additive, Gaussian noise channels, symmetric power constraints, and a multicast session.

引入了一类通道，其中在指定长度的块内存在内存，并且在块之间没有存储器。多用户模型被称为具有块内存（NiBM）的信息网络。结果表明，块衰落信道，编码器因果状态已知的信道和延迟中继网络为NiBM。针对NiBM开发了一个切割集，它将统一，加强和推广离散无记忆网络的现有切割界限。这个界限为几类网络提供了新的有限字母容量表达式，包括点对点信道和某些多路访问，广播和中继信道。基于随机编码字母的基数边界被开发，其改进了在编码器上可用的与动作相关状态的信道的现有边界，以及用于没有延迟的中继。最后，量化前向网络编码被示出为在线性，加性高斯噪声信道，对称功率约束和多播会话的新割集的加入间隙内实现速率。
