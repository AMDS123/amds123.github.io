##### Abstract
Deep Models, typically Deep neural networks, have millions of parameters, analyze medical data accurately, yet in a time-consuming method. However, energy cost effectiveness and computational efficiency are important for prerequisites developing and deploying mobile-enabled devices, the mainstream trend in connected healthcare.
