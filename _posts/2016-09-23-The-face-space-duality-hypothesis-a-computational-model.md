##### Abstract
Valentine's face-space suggests that faces are represented in a psychological multidimensional space according to their perceived properties. However, the proposed framework was initially designed as an account of invariant facial features only, and explanations for dynamic features representation were neglected. In this paper we propose, develop and evaluate a computational model for a twofold structure of the face-space, able to unify both identity and expression representations in a single implemented model. To capture both invariant and dynamic facial features we introduce the face-space duality hypothesis and subsequently validate it through a mathematical presentation using a general approach to dimensionality reduction. Two experiments with real facial images show that the proposed face-space: (1) supports both identity and expression recognition, and (2) has a twofold structure anticipated by our formal argument.

情人的脸部空间表明，脸部是根据他们的感知属性在心理多维空间中呈现。然而，所提出的框架最初被设计为仅仅是不变的面部特征的描述，并且对动态特征表示的解释被忽略。在本文中，我们建议，开发和评估一个面部空间的双重结构的计算模型，能够统一身份和表达表示在一个单一的实施模型。为了捕捉不变和动态的面部特征，我们引入面空间二元性假设，并随后通过使用降维的一般方法的数学表示来验证它。两个实际面部图像的实验表明，所提出的面孔空间：（1）同时支持身份和表达的识别，和（2）有一个双重的结构，我们的正式论证预期。
