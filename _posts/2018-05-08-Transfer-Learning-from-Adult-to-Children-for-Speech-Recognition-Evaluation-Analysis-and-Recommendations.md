##### Abstract
Children speech recognition is challenging mainly due to the inherent high variability in children's physical and articulatory characteristics and expressions. This variability manifests in both acoustic constructs and linguistic usage due to the rapidly changing developmental stage in children's life. Part of the challenge is due to the lack of large amounts of available children speech data for efficient modeling. This work attempts to address the key challenges using transfer learning from adult's models to children's models in a Deep Neural Network (DNN) framework for children's Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) task evaluating on multiple children's speech corpora with a large vocabulary. The paper presents a systematic and an extensive analysis of the proposed transfer learning technique considering the key factors affecting children's speech recognition from prior literature. Evaluations are presented on (i) comparisons of earlier GMM-HMM and the newer DNN Models, (ii) effectiveness of standard adaptation techniques versus transfer learning, (iii) various adaptation configurations in tackling the variabilities present in children speech, in terms of (a) acoustic spectral variability, and (b) pronunciation variability and linguistic constraints. Our Analysis spans over (i) number of DNN model parameters (for adaptation), (ii) amount of adaptation data, (iii) ages of children, (iv) age dependent-independent adaptation. Finally, we provide Recommendations on (i) the favorable strategies over various aforementioned - analyzed parameters, and (ii) potential future research directions and relevant challenges/problems persisting in DNN based ASR for children's speech.

儿童语音识别具有挑战性，主要是由于儿童身体和发音特征和表达的固有高度变化。由于儿童生活中快速变化的发育阶段，这种变化表现在声学构造和语言使用上。部分挑战是由于缺乏大量可用的儿童语音数据进行高效建模。这项工作试图解决使用从成人模型到深度神经网络（DNN）儿童自动语音识别（ASR）任务框架中的儿童模型的转移学习的关键挑战，该任务评估多个儿童的语言语料库具有大词汇量。本文对考虑影响儿童语音识别的关键因素的传递学习技术进行了系统而广泛的分析。 （i）较早的GMM-HMM和较新的DNN模型的比较，（ii）标准适应技术与转移学习的有效性，（iii）解决儿童言语中存在的变化的各种适应配置， a）声谱变化，和（b）发音变异性和语言限制。我们的分析涵盖了（i）DNN模型参数（用于适应），（ii）适应数据量，（iii）儿童年龄，（iv）依赖于年龄的独立适应。最后，我们提供以下建议：（i）针对上述各种分析参数的有利策略，以及（ii）潜在的未来研究方向以及基于DNN的儿童言语ASR中持续存在的相关挑战/问题。
