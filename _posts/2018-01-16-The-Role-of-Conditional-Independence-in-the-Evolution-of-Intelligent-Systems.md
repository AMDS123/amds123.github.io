##### Abstract
Systems are typically made from simple components regardless of their complexity. While the function of each part is easily understood, higher order functions are emergent properties and are notoriously difficult to explain. In networked systems, both digital and biological, each component receives inputs, performs a simple computation, and creates an output. When these components have multiple outputs, we intuitively assume that the outputs are causally dependent on the inputs but are themselves independent of each other given the state of their shared input. However, this intuition can be violated for components with probabilistic logic, as these typically cannot be decomposed into separate logic gates with one output each. This violation of conditional independence on the past system state is equivalent to instantaneous interaction --- the idea is that some information between the outputs is not coming from the inputs and thus must have been created instantaneously. Here we compare evolved artificial neural systems with and without instantaneous interaction across several task environments. We show that systems without instantaneous interactions evolve faster, to higher final levels of performance, and require fewer logic components to create a densely connected cognitive machinery.

系统通常由简单的部件制成，无论其复杂程度如何。虽然每个部分的功能都很容易理解，但是高阶函数是新兴性质，而且难以解释。在数字和生物网络系统中，每个组件接收输入，执行简单的计算，并创建一个输出。当这些组件有多个输出时，我们直观地认为输出是依赖于输入的因果关系，但是它们本身是相互独立的，因为它们共享输入的状态。然而，对于具有概率逻辑的组件来说，这种直觉是可以违反的，因为这些组件通常不能被分解成单独的具有一个输出的逻辑门。这种对过去系统状态的条件独立性的违反等价于即时交互 - 这个想法是，输出之间的某些信息不是来自输入，因此必须是瞬间创建的。在这里，我们比较了进化的人工神经系统在多个任务环境中是否有瞬时交互。我们表明，没有即时交互的系统演变得更快，性能更高，并需要更少的逻辑组件来创建密集连接的认知机制。
