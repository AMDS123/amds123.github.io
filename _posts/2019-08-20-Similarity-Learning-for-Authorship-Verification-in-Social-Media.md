##### Abstract
Authorship verification tries to answer the question if two documents with unknown authors were written by the same author or not. A range of successful technical approaches has been proposed for this task, many of which are based on traditional linguistic features such as n-grams. These algorithms achieve good results for certain types of written documents like books and novels. Forensic authorship verification for social media, however, is a much more challenging task since messages tend to be relatively short, with a large variety of different genres and topics. At this point, traditional methods based on features like n-grams have had limited success. In this work, we propose a new neural network topology for similarity learning that significantly improves the performance on the author verification task with such challenging data sets.
