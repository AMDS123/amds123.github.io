##### Abstract
Human engagement in narrative is partially driven by reasoning about discourse relations between narrative events, and the expectations about what is likely to happen next that results from such reasoning. Researchers in NLP have tackled modeling such expectations from a range of perspectives, including treating it as the inference of the contingent discourse relation, or as a type of common-sense causal reasoning. Our approach is to model likelihood between events by drawing on several of these lines of previous work. We implement and evaluate different unsupervised methods for learning event pairs that are likely to be contingent on one another. We refine event pairs that we learn from a corpus of film scene descriptions utilizing web search counts, and evaluate our results by collecting human judgments of contingency. Our results indicate that the use of web search counts increases the average accuracy of our best method to 85.64% over a baseline of 50%, as compared to an average accuracy of 75.15% without web search.

叙事的人类参与部分是由叙述事件之间的话语关系的推理所驱动的，而这种推论所产生的下一个可能发生的事情的预期。 NLP的研究人员从一系列的角度来处理这种期望的建模，包括将其视为对或然话语关系的推断，或者将其视为一种常识因果推理。我们的方法是通过利用以前工作的几条线来模拟事件之间的可能性。我们实施和评估不同的无监督方法，以学习可能相互依赖的事件对。我们利用网络搜索计数来优化从电影场景描述语料库中学习的事件对，并通过收集人为的意外事件判断来评估我们的结果。我们的研究结果表明，使用网络搜索计数将平均准确度提高到了50.6％的基线时的85.64％，而没有网络搜索的平均准确率为75.15％。
