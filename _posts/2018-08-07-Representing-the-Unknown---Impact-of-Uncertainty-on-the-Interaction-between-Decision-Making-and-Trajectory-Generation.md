##### Abstract
Even though motion planning for automated vehicles has been extensively discussed for more than two decades, it is still a highly active field of research with a variety of different approaches having been published in the recent years. When considering the market introduction of SAE Level 3+ vehicles, the topic of motion planning will most likely be subject to even more detailed discussions between safety and user acceptance. This paper shall discuss parameters of the motion planning problem and requirements to an environment model. The focus is put on the representation of different types of uncertainty at the example of sensor occlusion, arguing the importance of a well-defined interface between decision making and trajectory generation.

尽管自动车辆的运动规划已经被广泛讨论了二十多年，但它仍然是一个高度活跃的研究领域，近年来已经出版了各种不同的方法。在考虑SAE Level 3+车辆的市场介绍时，运动规划的主题很可能会在安全性和用户接受度之间进行更详细的讨论。本文将讨论运动规划问题的参数和对环境模型的要求。在传感器遮挡的例子中，重点放在不同类型的不确定性的表示上，论证了决策制定和轨迹生成之间明确定义的界面的重要性。
