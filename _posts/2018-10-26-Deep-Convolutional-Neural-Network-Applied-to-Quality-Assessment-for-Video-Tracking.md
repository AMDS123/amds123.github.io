##### Abstract
Surveillance videos often suffer from blur and exposure distortions that occur during acquisition and storage, which can adversely influence following automatic image analysis results on video-analytic tasks. The purpose of this paper is to deploy an algorithm that can automatically assess the presence of exposure distortion in videos. In this work we to design and build one architecture for deep learning applied to recognition of distortions in a video. The goal is to know if the video present exposure distortions. Such an algorithm could be used to enhance or restoration image or to create an object tracker distortion-aware.
