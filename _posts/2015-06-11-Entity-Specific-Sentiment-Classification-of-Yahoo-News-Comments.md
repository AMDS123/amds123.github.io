##### Abstract
Sentiment classification is widely used for product reviews and in online social media such as forums, Twitter, and blogs. However, the problem of classifying the sentiment of user comments on news sites has not been addressed yet. News sites cover a wide range of domains including politics, sports, technology, and entertainment, in contrast to other online social sites such as forums and review sites, which are specific to a particular domain. A user associated with a news site is likely to post comments on diverse topics (e.g., politics, smartphones, and sports) or diverse entities (e.g., Obama, iPhone, or Google). Classifying the sentiment of users tied to various entities may help obtain a holistic view of their personality, which could be useful in applications such as online advertising, content personalization, and political campaign planning. In this paper, we formulate the problem of entity-specific sentiment classification of comments posted on news articles in Yahoo News and propose novel features that are specific to news comments. Experimental results show that our models outperform state-of-the-art baselines.

情感分类广泛用于产品评论和在线社交媒体，如论坛，Twitter和博客。然而，新闻网站对用户评论的分类问题尚未得到解决。新闻网站涵盖广泛的领域，包括政治，体育，科技和娱乐，与其他在线社交网站（如论坛和评论网站）相比，具体到特定领域。与新闻站点相关联的用户可能在不同主题（例如，政治，智能手机和体育）或不同实体（例如奥巴马，iPhone或谷歌）上发表评论。根据与各种实体相关联的用户的情绪分类可能有助于获得他们个性的整体观点，这对于在线广告，内容个性化和政治活动计划等应用可能是有用的。在本文中，我们制定雅虎新闻新闻文章上发表评论的实体特定情感分类问题，并提出新闻评论特有的新颖特征。实验结果表明，我们的模型胜过了最先进的基线。
