##### Abstract
The superior temporal gyrus (STG) region of cortex critically contributes to speech recognition. In this work, we show that a proposed WaveNet, with limited available data, is able to reconstruct speech stimuli from STG intracranial recordings. We further investigate the impulse response of the fitted model for each recording electrode and observe phoneme level temporospectral tuning properties for the recorded area of cortex. This discovery is consistent with previous studies implicating the posterior STG (pSTG) in a phonetic representation of speech and provides detailed acoustic features that certain electrode sites possibly extract during speech recognition.
