##### Abstract
We describe a new approach and algorithm for the detection of artificial signals and their classification in the search for extraterrestrial intelligence (SETI). The characteristics of radio signals observed during SETI research are often most apparent when those signals are represented as spectrograms. Additionally, many observed signals tend to share the same characteristics, allowing for sorting of the signals into different classes. For this work, complex-valued time-series data were simulated to produce a corpus of 140,000 signals from seven different signal classes. A wide residual neural network was then trained to classify these signal types using the gray-scale 2D spectrogram representation of those signals. An average $F_1$ score of 95.11\% was attained when tested on previously unobserved simulated signals. We also report on the performance of the model across a range of signal amplitudes.

我们描述了一种新的方法和算法，用于检测人造信号及其在寻找地外智慧（SETI）中的分类。当SETI研究期间观察到的无线电信号的特征通常在将这些信号表示为频谱图时最明显。此外，许多观察到的信号倾向于共享相同的特征，允许将信号分类成不同的类别。对于这项工作，复杂值的时间序列数据被模拟以产生来自7个不同信号类别的140,000个信号的语料库。然后训练一个宽的残差神经网络，使用这些信号的灰度二维谱图表示对这些信号类型进行分类。在先前未观测到的模拟信号上进行测试时，平均$ F_1 $得分为95.11％。我们还报告了模型在一系列信号幅度上的表现。
