##### Abstract
We studied electric current and noise in planar GaN nanowires (NWs). The results obtained at low voltages provide us with estimates of the depletion effects in the NWs. For larger voltages, we observed the space-charge limited current (SCLC) effect. The onset of the effect clearly correlates with the NW width. For narrow NWs the mature SCLC regime was achieved. This effect has great impact on fluctuation characteristics of studied NWs. At low voltages, we found that the normalized noise level increases with decreasing NW width. In the SCLC regime, a further increase in the normalized noise intensity (up to 1E4 times) was observed, as well as a change in the shape of the spectra with a tendency towards slope -3/2. We suggest that the features of the electric current and noise found in the NWs are of a general character and will have an impact on the development of NW-based devices.

##### Abstract (translated by Google)
我们研究了平面GaN纳米线（NW）中的电流和噪声。在低电压下获得的结果为我们提供了对NW中耗尽效应的估计。对于较大的电压，我们观察到空间电荷限制电流（SCLC）效应。效应的开始与NW宽度明显相关。对于狭窄的NW，实现了成熟的SCLC方案。这种影响对研究NW的波动特性有很大的影响。在低电压下，我们发现归一化噪声水平随着NW宽度的减小而增加。在SCLC体系中，观察到归一化噪声强度（最多1E4次）的进一步增加，以及具有倾斜-3/2的趋势的谱的形状的变化。我们建议NW中发现的电流和噪声具有一般特性，将会影响NW装置的发展。
