##### Abstract
We prove the main rules of causal calculus (also called do-calculus) for interventional structural causal models (iSCMs), a generalization of a recently proposed general class of non-/linear structural causal models that allow for cycles, latent confounders and arbitrary probability distributions. We also generalize adjustment criteria and formulas from the acyclic setting to the general one (i.e. iSCMs). Such criteria then allow to estimate (conditional) causal effects from observational data that was (partially) gathered under selection bias and cycles. This generalizes the backdoor criterion, the selection-backdoor criterion and extensions of these to arbitrary iSCMs. Together, our results thus enable causal reasoning in the presence of cycles, latent confounders and selection bias.
