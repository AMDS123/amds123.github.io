##### Abstract
Whether it is computer vision, natural language processing or speech recognition, the essence of these applications is to obtain powerful feature representations that make downstream applications completion more efficient. Taking image recognition as an example, whether it is hand-crafted low-level feature representation or feature representation extracted by a convolutional neural networks(CNNs), the goal is to extract features that better represent image features, thereby improving classification accuracy. However, we observed that image feature representations share a large common vector and a few top dominating directions. To address this problems, we propose a simple but effective postprocessing method to render off-the-shelf feature representations even stronger by eliminating the common mean vector from off-the-shelf feature representations. The postprocessing is empirically validated on a variety of datasets and feature extraction methods.such as VGG, LBP, and HOG. Some experiments show that the features that have been post-processed by postprocessing algorithm can get better results than original ones.
