##### Abstract
It is well known that clothing fashion is a distinctive and often habitual trend in the style in which a person dresses. Clothing fashions are usually expressed with visual stimuli such as style, color, and texture. However, it is not clear which visual stimulus places higher/lower influence on the updating of clothing fashion. In this study, computer vision and machine learning techniques are employed to analyze the influence of different visual stimuli on clothing-fashion updates. Specifically, a classification-based model is proposed to quantify the influence of different visual stimuli, in which each visual stimulus's influence is quantified by its corresponding accuracy in fashion classification. Experimental results demonstrate that, on clothing-fashion updates, the style holds a higher influence than the color, and the color holds a higher influence than the texture.

众所周知，服装时尚是一个人穿衣风格中的一个独特的，往往是习惯性的趋势。服装时尚通常以视觉刺激来表现，如风格，颜色和质地。然而，目前尚不清楚哪一种视觉刺激对服装时尚的更新影响更大/更小。在这项研究中，计算机视觉和机器学习技术被用来分析不同的视觉刺激对服装时尚更新的影响。具体而言，提出了基于分类的模型来量化不同视觉刺激的影响，其中每个视觉刺激的影响通过时尚分类中的相应准确度来量化。实验结果表明，在服装时尚更新上，风格比颜色具有更高的影响力，颜色比纹理具有更高的影响力。
