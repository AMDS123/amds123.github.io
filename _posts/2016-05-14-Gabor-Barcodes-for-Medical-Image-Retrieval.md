##### Abstract
In recent years, advances in medical imaging have led to the emergence of massive databases, containing images from a diverse range of modalities. This has significantly heightened the need for automated annotation of the images on one side, and fast and memory-efficient content-based image retrieval systems on the other side. Binary descriptors have recently gained more attention as a potential vehicle to achieve these goals. One of the recently introduced binary descriptors for tagging of medical images are Radon barcodes (RBCs) that are driven from Radon transform via local thresholding. Gabor transform is also a powerful transform to extract texture-based information. Gabor features have exhibited robustness against rotation, scale, and also photometric disturbances, such as illumination changes and image noise in many applications. This paper introduces Gabor Barcodes (GBCs), as a novel framework for the image annotation. To find the most discriminative GBC for a given query image, the effects of employing Gabor filters with different parameters, i.e., different sets of scales and orientations, are investigated, resulting in different barcode lengths and retrieval performances. The proposed method has been evaluated on the IRMA dataset with 193 classes comprising of 12,677 x-ray images for indexing, and 1,733 x-rays images for testing. A total error score as low as $351$ ($\approx 80\%$ accuracy for the first hit) was achieved.

近年来，医学成像的进步导致了大量数据库的出现，其中包含来自各种模式的图像。这显着提高了一方对图像的自动注释的需要，另一方面提高了快速且高效的基于内容的图像检索系统。最近，二元描述符作为实现这些目标的潜在手段得到了更多关注。最近引入的用于医学图像标记的二进制描述符之一是通过局部阈值处理从Radon变换驱动的Radon条形码（RBC）。 Gabor变换也是提取基于纹理的信息的强大变换。 Gabor特征已经表现出对抗旋转，缩放以及光度干扰的稳健性，诸如在许多应用中的照明变化和图像噪声。本文介绍了Gabor条码（GBCs）作为一种新颖的图像标注框架。为了给给定的查询图像找到最具有区别性的GBC，研究了使用具有不同参数的Gabor滤波器，即不同的尺度和方向集合的效果，导致不同的条码长度和检索性能。所提出的方法已经在IRMA数据集上进行了评估，193个类别包括用于索引的12,677个X射线图像和用于测试的1,733个X射线图像。总误差分数低至$ 351 $（$ \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'）。
