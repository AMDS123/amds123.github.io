##### Abstract
In recent years, deep learning methods have been successfully applied to single-image super-resolution tasks. Despite their great performances, deep learning methods cannot be easily applied to real-world applications due to the requirement of heavy computation. In this paper, we address this issue by proposing an accurate and lightweight deep network for image super-resolution. In detail, we design an architecture that implements a cascading mechanism upon a residual network. We also present variant models of the proposed cascading residual network to further improve efficiency. Our extensive experiments show that even with much fewer parameters and operations, our models achieve performance comparable to that of state-of-the-art methods.

近年来，深度学习方法已成功应用于单图像超分辨率任务。尽管它们具有很好的性能，但由于需要大量计算，深度学习方法不能轻易应用于实际应用。在本文中，我们通过提出一个准确，轻量级的图像超分辨率深度网络来解决这个问题。详细地说，我们设计了一种在剩余网络上实现级联机制的架构。我们还提出了所提出的级联剩余网络的变体模型，以进一步提高效率。我们的广泛实验表明，即使参数和操作更少，我们的模型也能达到与最先进方法相媲美的性能。
