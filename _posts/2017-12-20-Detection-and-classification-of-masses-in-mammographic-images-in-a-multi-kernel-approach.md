##### Abstract
According to the World Health Organization, breast cancer is the main cause of cancer death among adult women in the world. Although breast cancer occurs indiscriminately in countries with several degrees of social and economic development, among developing and underdevelopment countries mortality rates are still high, due to low availability of early detection technologies. From the clinical point of view, mammography is still the most effective diagnostic technology, given the wide diffusion of the use and interpretation of these images. Herein this work we propose a method to detect and classify mammographic lesions using the regions of interest of images. Our proposal consists in decomposing each image using multi-resolution wavelets. Zernike moments are extracted from each wavelet component. Using this approach we can combine both texture and shape features, which can be applied both to the detection and classification of mammary lesions. We used 355 images of fatty breast tissue of IRMA database, with 233 normal instances (no lesion), 72 benign, and 83 malignant cases. Classification was performed by using SVM and ELM networks with modified kernels, in order to optimize accuracy rates, reaching 94.11%. Considering both accuracy rates and training times, we defined the ration between average percentage accuracy and average training time in a reverse order. Our proposal was 50 times higher than the ratio obtained using the best method of the state-of-the-art. As our proposed model can combine high accuracy rate with low learning time, whenever a new data is received, our work will be able to save a lot of time, hours, in learning process in relation to the best method of the state-of-the-art.

据世界卫生组织报道，乳腺癌是全球成年女性癌症死亡的主要原因。虽然乳腺癌在有着一定程度的社会和经济发展的国家不分青红皂白地发生，但发展中国家和发展不足国家由于早期检测技术的可用性低，死亡率仍然很高。从临床角度来看，考虑到这些图像的广泛使用和解释，乳房X线照相仍然是最有效的诊断技术。在这项工作中，我们提出了一种方法来检测和分类使用图像的感兴趣区域的乳房X线照相病变。我们的建议在于使用多分辨率小波分解每个图像。 Zernike矩是从每个小波分量中提取的。使用这种方法，我们可以结合纹理和形状特征，这可以应用于乳腺病变的检测和分类。我们使用了355个IRMA数据库的脂肪乳房组织图像，233个正常情况下（无病灶），72个良性病例和83个恶性病例。采用SVM和ELM网络进行分类，修正内核，以达到最优的准确率，达到94.11％。考虑到准确率和训练时间，我们以相反的顺序定义了平均百分比准确率和平均训练时间之间的比例。我们的建议比使用最先进的最佳方法获得的比率高出50倍。由于我们提出的模型可以将高准确率和低学习时间相结合，每当接收到新的数据时，我们的工作将能够在学习过程中节省大量的时间，相对于最先进的方法，艺术。
