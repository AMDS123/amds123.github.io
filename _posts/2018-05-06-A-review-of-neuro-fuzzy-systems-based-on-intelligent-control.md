##### Abstract
The system's ability to adapt and self-organize are two key factors when it comes to how well the system can survive the changes to the environment and the plant they work within. Intelligent control improves these two factors in controllers. Considering the increasing complexity of dynamic systems along with their need for feedback controls, using more complicated controls has become necessary and intelligent control can be a suitable response to this necessity. This paper briefly describes the structure of intelligent control and provides a review on fuzzy logic and neural networks which are some of the base methods for intelligent control. The different aspects of these two methods are then compared together and an example of a combined method is presented.

##### Abstract (translated by Google)
该系统的适应能力和自组织能力是两个关键因素，它涉及到系统如何在环境和工厂所在环境发生变化时幸免于难。智能控制改善了控制器中的这两个因素。考虑到动态系统的日益复杂以及对反馈控制的需求，使用更复杂的控制已经变得必要，并且智能控制可以是对这种必要性的适当响应。本文简要介绍了智能控制的结构，并对模糊逻辑和神经网络进行了综述，这些是智能控制的一些基本方法。然后将这两种方法的不同方面进行比较，并给出组合方法的一个例子。
