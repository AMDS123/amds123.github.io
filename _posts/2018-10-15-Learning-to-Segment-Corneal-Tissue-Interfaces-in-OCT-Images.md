##### Abstract
Accurate and repeatable delineation of corneal tissue interfaces is necessary for surgical planning during anterior segment interventions, such as Keratoplasty. Designing an approach to identify interfaces, which generalizes to datasets acquired from different Optical Coherence Tomographic (OCT) scanners, is paramount. In this paper, we present a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based framework called CorNet that can accurately segment three corneal interfaces across datasets obtained with different scan settings from different OCT scanners. Extensive validation of the approach was conducted across all imaged datasets. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first deep learning based approach to segment both anterior and posterior corneal tissue interfaces, and our errors are 2x lower than the non-proprietary state-of-the-art image analysis-based and deep learning approaches applied towards corneal tissue interface segmentation.
