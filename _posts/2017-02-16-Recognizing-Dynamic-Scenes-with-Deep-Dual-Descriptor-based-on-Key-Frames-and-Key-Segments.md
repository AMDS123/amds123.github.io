##### Abstract
Recognizing dynamic scenes is one of the fundamental problems in scene understanding, which categorizes moving scenes such as a forest fire, landslide, or avalanche. While existing methods focus on reliable capturing of static and dynamic information, few works have explored frame selection from a dynamic scene sequence. In this paper, we propose dynamic scene recognition using a deep dual descriptor based on `key frames' and `key segments.' Key frames that reflect the feature distribution of the sequence with a small number are used for capturing salient static appearances. Key segments, which are captured from the area around each key frame, provide an additional discriminative power by dynamic patterns within short time intervals. To this end, two types of transferred convolutional neural network features are used in our approach. A fully connected layer is used to select the key frames and key segments, while the convolutional layer is used to describe them. We conducted experiments using public datasets as well as a new dataset comprised of 23 dynamic scene classes with 10 videos per class. The evaluation results demonstrated the state-of-the-art performance of the proposed method.

认识动态场景是场景理解中的一个基本问题，它将森林火灾，山体滑坡，雪崩等移动场景进行分类。虽然现有的方法专注于静态和动态信息的可靠捕捉，但很少有作品从动态场景序列中探索帧选择。在本文中，我们提出了基于“关键帧”和“关键段”的深度双重描述符的动态场景识别。反映小序列序列特征分布的关键帧用于捕获显着的静态外观。从每个关键帧周围的区域捕获的关键段在短时间间隔内通过动态模式提供附加的判别力。为此，我们采用了两种类型的转移卷积神经网络特征。一个完全连接的层被用来选择关键帧和关键字段，而卷积层被用来描述它们。我们使用公共数据集进行了实验，以及由23个动态场景类组成的新数据集，每个类有10个视频。评估结果显示了该方法的最新性能。
