##### Abstract
Human eye gaze detection plays an important role in various fields, including human-computer interaction, virtual reality and cognitive science. Although different relatively accurate systems of eye tracking and gaze detection exist, they are usually either too expensive to be bought for low cost applications or too complex to be implemented easily. In this article, we propose a non-wearable system for eye tracking and gaze detection with low complexity and cost. The proposed system provides a medium accuracy which makes it suitable for general applications in which low cost and easy implementation is more important than achieving very precise gaze detection. The proposed method includes pupil and marker detection using infrared image processing, and gaze evaluation using an interpolation-based strategy. The interpolation-based strategy exploits the positions of the detected pupils and markers in a target captured image and also in some previously captured training images for estimating the position of a point that the user is gazing at. The proposed system has been evaluated by three users in two different lighting conditions. The experimental results show that the accuracy of this low cost system can be between 90% and 100% for finding major gazing directions.

人眼视线检测在人机交互，虚拟现实，认知科学等各个领域都发挥着重要的作用。尽管存在不同的相对精确的眼睛跟踪和注视检测系统，但是它们通常要么太昂贵而不能用于低成本应用，要么太复杂而不容易实现。在这篇文章中，我们提出了一个低复杂度和低成本的眼睛跟踪和注视检测非可穿戴系统。所提出的系统提供了中等精度，使其适用于低成本且易于实现比实现非常精确的凝视检测更重要的一般应用。所提出的方法包括使用红外图像处理的瞳孔和标记检测，以及使用基于插值的策略的注视评估。基于插值的策略利用检测到的瞳孔和标记在目标捕获的图像中的位置以及还在一些先前捕获的训练图像中用于估计用户正在注视的点的位置。所提出的系统已经由三个用户在两种不同的照明条件下进行评估。实验结果表明，这个低成本系统的精度可以在90％到100％之间，以找到主要的注视方向。
