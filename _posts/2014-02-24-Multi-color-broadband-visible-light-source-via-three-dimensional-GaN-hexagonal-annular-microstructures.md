##### Abstract
Broadband visible light emitting, three-dimensional hexagonal annular microstructures with InGaN/GaN multiple quantum wells (MQWs) are fabricated via selective-area epitaxial growth. The single hexagonal annular structure is composed of not only polar facet of (0001) on top surface but also semi-polar facets of {10-11} and {11-22} in inner and outer sidewalls, exhibiting multi-color visible light emission from InGaN/GaN MQWs formed on the different facets. The InGaN MQWs on (0001) facet emits the longer wavelength (green color) due to the larger well thickness and the higher In composition, while those on semi-polar facets of {10-11} and {11-22} had highly-efficient shorter wavelength (violet to blue color) emission caused by smaller well thickness and smaller In composition. By combining the multiple color emission depending on different facets, high efficiency broadband visible light emission could be achieved. The emission color can be changed with excitation power density owing to the built-in electric field on the (0001) facet, which is confirmed by time-resolved luminescence experiments. The hexagonal annular structures can be a critical building block for highly efficient broadband visible light emitting sources, providing a solution to previous problems related to the fabrication issues for phosphor-free white light emitting devices.
