##### Abstract
Literature involving preferences of artificial agents or human beings often assume their preferences can be represented using a complete transitive binary relation. Much has been written however on different models of preferences. We review some of the reasons that have been put forward to justify more complex modeling, and review some of the techniques that have been proposed to obtain models of such preferences.

##### Abstract (translated by Google)
涉及人工代理或人类偏好的文献通常假设他们的偏好可以用完整的传递二元关系来表示。很多已经写了不同的喜好模式。我们回顾一些已经提出的理由来证明更复杂的建模，并回顾一些已经提出的技术来获得这种偏好的模型。
