##### Abstract
Human understanding of narrative is mainly driven by reasoning about causal relations between events and thus recognizing them is a key capability for computational models of language understanding. Computational work in this area has approached this via two different routes: by focusing on acquiring a knowledge base of common causal relations between events, or by attempting to understand a particular story or macro-event, along with its storyline. In this position paper, we focus on knowledge acquisition approach and claim that newswire is a relatively poor source for learning fine-grained causal relations between everyday events. We describe experiments using an unsupervised method to learn causal relations between events in the narrative genres of first-person narratives and film scene descriptions. We show that our method learns fine-grained causal relations, judged by humans as likely to be causal over 80% of the time. We also demonstrate that the learned event pairs do not exist in publicly available event-pair datasets extracted from newswire.

##### Abstract (translated by Google)
人类对叙事的理解主要是由事件之间因果关系的推理驱动的，因此认识它们是语言理解计算模型的关键能力。这个领域的计算工作通过两条路线来解决：通过关注获取事件之间共同因果关系的知识库，或者试图理解一个特定的故事或宏观事件以及故事情节。在这篇立场文件中，我们专注于知识获取方法，并声称新闻专线是学习日常事件之间细微因果关系的相对较差的来源。我们用一种无监督的方法来描述实验，以了解第一人称叙述和电影场景描述的叙述体裁中的事件之间的因果关系。我们表明，我们的方法学习细粒度的因果关系，由人类判断可能是超过80％的因果关系。我们还证明，从newswire提取的公开可用事件对数据集中不存在学到的事件对。
