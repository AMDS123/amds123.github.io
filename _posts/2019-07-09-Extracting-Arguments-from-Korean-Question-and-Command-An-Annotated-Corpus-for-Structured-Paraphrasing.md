##### Abstract
Intention identification is a core issue in dialog management. However, due to the non-canonicality of the spoken language, it is difficult to extract the content automatically from the conversation-style utterances. This is much more challenging for languages like Korean and Japanese since the agglutination between morphemes make it difficult for the machines to parse the sentence and understand the intention. To suggest a guideline for this problem, and to merge the issue flexibly with the neural paraphrasing systems introduced recently, we propose a structured annotation scheme for Korean question/commands and the resulting corpus which are widely applicable to the field of argument mining. The scheme and dataset are expected to help machines understand the intention of natural language and grasp the core meaning of conversation-style instructions.
