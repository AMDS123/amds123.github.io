##### Abstract
The crowdsourcing consists in the externalisation of tasks to a crowd of people remunerated to execute this ones. The crowd, usually diversified, can include users without qualification and/or motivation for the tasks. In this paper we will introduce a new method of user expertise modelization in the crowdsourcing platforms based on the theory of belief functions in order to identify serious and qualificated users.
