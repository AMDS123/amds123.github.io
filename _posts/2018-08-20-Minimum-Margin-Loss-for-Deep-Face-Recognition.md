##### Abstract
Face recognition has achieved great progress owing to the fast development of the deep neural network in the past a few years. As an important part of deep neural networks, a number of the loss functions have been proposed which significantly improve the state-of-the-art methods. In this paper, we proposed a new loss function called Minimum Margin Loss (MML) which aims at enlarging the margin of those overclose class centre pairs so as to enhance the discriminative ability of the deep features. MML supervises the training process together with the Softmax Loss and the Centre Loss, and also makes up the defect of Softmax + Centre Loss. The experimental results on MegaFace, LFW and YTF datasets show that the proposed method achieves the state-of-the-art performance, which demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed MML.

由于近几年来深度神经网络的快速发展，人脸识别取得了很大的进步。作为深度神经网络的重要部分，已经提出了许多损失函数，其显着改进了最先进的方法。在本文中，我们提出了一种新的损失函数称为最小保证金损失（MML），旨在扩大那些过度密集的类中心对的边际，以增强深度特征的判别能力。 MML监控培训过程以及Softmax Loss和Center Loss，并弥补了Softmax + Center Loss的缺陷。 MegaFace，LFW和YTF数据集的实验结果表明，该方法实现了最先进的性能，证明了所提出的MML的有效性。
