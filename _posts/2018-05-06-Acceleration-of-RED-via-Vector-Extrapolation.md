##### Abstract
Models play an important role in inverse problems, serving as the prior for representing the original signal to be recovered. REgularization by Denoising (RED) is a recently introduced general framework for constructing such priors using state-of-the-art denoising algorithms. Using RED, solving inverse problems is shown to amount to an iterated denoising process. However, as the complexity of denoising algorithms is generally high, this might lead to an overall slow algorithm. In this paper, we suggest an accelerated technique based on vector extrapolation (VE) to speed-up existing RED solvers. Numerical experiments validate the obtained gain by VE, leading to nearly 70\% savings in computations compared with the original solvers.

模型在反演问题中起着重要作用，作为表示要恢复原始信号的先验信息。通过去噪（RED）进行重新调整是最近引入的使用最先进的去噪算法来构建这种前景的一般框架。使用RED，解决逆向问题被证明相当于一个迭代的去噪过程。然而，由于去噪算法的复杂性通常较高，这可能导致整体较慢的算法。在本文中，我们建议基于矢量外推（VE）的加速技术来加速现有的RED求解器。数值实验验证了通过VE获得的增益，与原始解算器相比，计算量节省了近70％。
