##### Abstract
This paper presents modification of the TwIST algorithm for Compressive Sensing MRI images reconstruction. Compressive Sensing is new approach in signal processing whose basic idea is recovering signal form small set of available samples. The application of the Compressive Sensing in biomedical imaging has found great importance. It allows significant lowering of the acquisition time, and therefore, save the patient from the negative impact of the MR apparatus. TwIST is commonly used algorithm for 2D signals reconstruction using Compressive Sensing principle. It is based on the Total Variation minimization. Standard version of the TwIST uses masked 2D Discrete Fourier Transform coefficients as Compressive Sensing measurements. In this paper, different masks and different transformation domains for coefficients selection are tested. Certain percent of the measurements is used from the mask, as well as small number of coefficients outside the mask. Comparative analysis using 2D DFT and 2D DCT coefficients, with different mask shapes is performed. The theory is proved with experimental results.

本文介绍了用于压缩感知MRI图像重建的TwIST算法的改进。压缩感知是信号处理中的新方法，其基本思想是从少量可用样本中恢复信号。压缩传感技术在生物医学成像中的应用非常重要。它可以显着缩短采集时间，从而使患者免受MR设备的负面影响。 TwIST是常用的压缩感知原理重建二维信号的算法。它基于全变差最小化。 TwIST的标准版本使用屏蔽2D离散傅立叶变换系数作为压缩感应测量。在本文中，测试了不同的掩模和用于系数选择的不同的变换域。某些百分比的测量值是从掩模中使用的，以及掩模外的少量系数。使用具有不同掩模形状的2D DFT和2D DCT系数进行比较分析。实验结果证明了该理论。
