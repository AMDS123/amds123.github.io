##### Abstract
In the last decades we have witnessed the success of applications of Artificial Intelligence to playing games. In this work we address the challenging field of games with hidden information and card games in particular. Jass is a very popular card game in Switzerland and is closely connected with Swiss culture. To the best of our knowledge, performances of Artificial Intelligence agents in the game of Jass do not outperform top players yet. Our contribution to the community is two-fold. First, we provide an overview of the current state-of-the-art of Artificial Intelligence methods for card games in general. Second, we discuss their application to the use-case of the Swiss card game Jass. This paper aims to be an entry point for both seasoned researchers and new practitioners who want to join in the Jass challenge.
