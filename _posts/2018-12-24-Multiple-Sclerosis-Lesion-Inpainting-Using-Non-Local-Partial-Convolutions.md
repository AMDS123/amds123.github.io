##### Abstract
Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an inflammatory demyelinating disease of the central nervous system (CNS) that results in focal injury to the grey and white matter. The presence of white matter lesions biases morphometric analyses such as registration, individual longitudinal measurements and tissue segmentation for brain volume measurements. Lesion-inpainting with intensities derived from surround healthy tissue represent one approach to alleviate such problems. However, existing methods inpaint lesions based on texture information derived from local surrounding tissue, often leading to inconsistent inpainting and the generation of artifacts such as intensity discrepancy and blurriness. Based on these observations, we propose non-local partial convolutions (NLPC) which integrates a Unet-like network with the non-local module. The non-local module is exploited to capture long range dependencies between the lesion area and remaining normal-appearing brain regions. Then, the lesion area is filled by referring to normal-appearing regions with more similar features. This method generates inpainted regions that appear more realistic and natural. Our quantitative experimental results also demonstrate superiority of this technique of existing state-of-the-art inpainting methods.
