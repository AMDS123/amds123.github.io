##### Abstract
This paper deals with motion planning for multiple agents by representing the problem as a simultaneous optimization of every agent's trajectory. Each trajectory is considered as a sample from a one-dimensional continuous-time Gaussian process (GP) generated by a linear time-varying stochastic differential equation driven by white noise. By formulating the planning problem as probabilistic inference on a factor graph, the structure of the pertaining GP can be exploited to find the solution efficiently using numerical optimization. In contrast to planning each agent's trajectory individually, where only the current poses of other agents are taken into account, we propose simultaneous planning of multiple trajectories that works in a predictive manner. It takes into account the information about each agent's whereabouts at every future time instant, since full trajectories of each agent are found jointly during a single optimization procedure. We compare the proposed method to an individual trajectory planning approach, demonstrating significant improvement in both success rate and computational efficiency.

本文通过将问题表示为同时优化每个代理的轨迹来处理多个代理的运动规划。每个轨迹被认为是由由白噪声驱动的线性时变随机微分方程生成的一维连续时间高斯过程（GP）的样本。通过将计划问题作为因子图上的概率推断，可以利用相关GP的结构利用数值优化有效地找到解决方案。与单独规划每个代理人的轨迹相反，只考虑当前其他代理人的姿态，我们建议同时计划多个预测性轨迹。考虑到每个代理在下一个时刻的行踪信息，因为每个代理的完整轨迹可以在单个优化程序中共同找到。我们将所提出的方法与单独的轨迹规划方法进行比较，证明了成功率和计算效率的显着提高。
