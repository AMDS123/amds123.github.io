##### Abstract
The relationship between reading and writing (RRW) is one of the major themes in learning science. One of its obstacles is that it is difficult to define or measure the latent background knowledge of the individual. However, in an academic research setting, scholars are required to explicitly list their background knowledge in the citation sections of their manuscripts. This unique opportunity was taken advantage of to observe RRW, especially in the published academic commentary scenario. RRW was visualized under a proposed topic process model by using a state of the art version of latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA). The empirical study showed that the academic commentary is modulated both by its target paper and the author's background knowledge. Although this conclusion was obtained in a unique environment, we suggest its implications can also shed light on other similar interesting areas, such as dialog and conversation, group discussion, and social media.

##### Abstract (translated by Google)
阅读与写作之间的关系是学习科学的主要课题之一。其中一个障碍是难以定义或测量个体的潜在背景知识。但是，在学术研究的背景下，学者需要在手稿的引文部分明确列出他们的背景知识。这个独特的机会被利用来观察RRW，尤其是在公布的学术评论场景中。通过使用最新的潜在狄里克莱分配（LDA）版本，RRW在提议的主题过程模型下被可视化。实证研究表明，学术评论是由目标论文和作者的背景知识来调整的。虽然这个结论是在一个独特的环境中获得的，但我们认为它的含义也可以揭示其他类似的有趣的领域，比如对话和对话，小组讨论和社交媒体。
