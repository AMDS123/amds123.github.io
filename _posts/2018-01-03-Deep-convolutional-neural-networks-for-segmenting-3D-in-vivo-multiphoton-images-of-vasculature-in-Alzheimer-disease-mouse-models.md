##### Abstract
The health and function of tissue rely on its vasculature network to provide reliable blood perfusion. Volumetric imaging approaches, such as multiphoton microscopy, are able to generate detailed 3D images of blood vessels that could contribute to our understanding of the role of vascular structure in normal physiology and in disease mechanisms. The segmentation of vessels, a core image analysis problem, is a bottleneck that has prevented the systematic comparison of 3D vascular architecture across experimental populations. We explored the use of convolutional neural networks to segment 3D vessels within volumetric in vivo images acquired by multiphoton microscopy. We evaluated different network architectures and machine learning techniques in the context of this segmentation problem. We show that our optimized convolutional neural network architecture, which we call DeepVess, yielded a segmentation accuracy that was better than both the current state-of-the-art and a trained human annotator, while also being orders of magnitude faster. To explore the effects of aging and Alzheimer's disease on capillaries, we applied DeepVess to 3D images of cortical blood vessels in young and old mouse models of Alzheimer's disease and wild type littermates. We found little difference in the distribution of capillary diameter or tortuosity between these groups, but did note a decrease in the number of longer capillary segments ($&gt;75\mu m$) in aged animals as compared to young, in both wild type and Alzheimer's disease mouse models.

组织的健康和功能依赖于其血管网络来提供可靠的血液灌注。体积成像方法，如多光子显微镜，能够生成详细的血管三维图像，可以有助于我们理解血管结构在正常生理和疾病机制中的作用。血管分割是一个核心图像分析问题，是阻碍实验人群3D血管结构系统性比较的一个瓶颈。我们探讨了使用卷积神经网络来分割多光子显微镜获取的体内体内图像内的三维血管。我们在这个分割问题的背景下评估了不同的网络架构和机器学习技术。我们展示了我们称之为DeepVess的优化卷积神经网络架构产生了比现有技术和训练有素的人类注释器更好的分割准确性，同时也是更快的数量级。为了探索衰老和阿尔茨海默病对毛细血管的影响，我们将DeepVess应用于阿尔茨海默氏病和野生型同窝小鼠的青年和老年小鼠模型中的三维皮层血管图像。我们发现这些组之间的毛细血管直径或弯曲度的分布几乎没有差异，但是注意到在老年动物中，与年轻的相比，在两种野生型中毛细血管片段的长度（$ 75＆mu; $）和阿尔茨海默病小鼠模型。
