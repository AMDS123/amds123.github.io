##### Abstract
The ability to precisely quantify similarity between various entities has been a fundamental complication in various problem spaces specifically in the classification of cellular images. Contemporary similarity measures applied in the domain of image processing proposed by the scientific community are mainly pursued in supervised settings. In this work, we will explore the innovative algorithmic normalized compression distance metric based on the information theoretic concept of Kolmogorov Complexity. Additionally we will observe its possible implementation in Convolutional Neural Networks to facilitate and automate the classification of Retinal Pigment Epithelial cell cultures for use in Age Related Macular Degeneration Stem Cell therapy in an unsupervised setting.
