##### Abstract
This paper gives an overview of our current Optical Music Recognition (OMR) research. We recently released the OMR dataset \emph{DeepScores} as well as the object detection method \emph{Deep Watershed Detector}. We are currently taking some additional steps to improve both of them. Here we summarize current and future efforts, aimed at improving usefulness on real-world task and tackling extreme class imbalance.
