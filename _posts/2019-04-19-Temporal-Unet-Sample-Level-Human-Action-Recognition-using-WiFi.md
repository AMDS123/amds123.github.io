##### Abstract
Human doing actions will result in WiFi distortion, which is widely explored for action recognition, such as the elderly fallen detection, hand sign language recognition, and keystroke estimation. As our best survey, past work recognizes human action by categorizing one complete distortion series into one action, which we term as series-level action recognition. In this paper, we introduce a much more fine-grained and challenging action recognition task into WiFi sensing domain, i.e., sample-level action recognition. In this task, every WiFi distortion sample in the whole series should be categorized into one action, which is a critical technique in precise action localization, continuous action segmentation, and real-time action recognition. To achieve WiFi-based sample-level action recognition, we fully analyze approaches in image-based semantic segmentation as well as in video-based frame-level action recognition, then propose a simple yet efficient deep convolutional neural network, i.e., Temporal Unet. Experimental results show that Temporal Unet achieves this novel task well. Codes have been made publicly available at https://github.com/geekfeiw/WiSLAR.
