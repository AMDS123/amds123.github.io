##### Abstract
This paper proposes a method for video smoke detection using synthetic smoke samples. The virtual data can automatically offer precise and rich annotated samples. However, the learning of smoke representations will be hurt by the appearance gap between real and synthetic smoke samples. The existed researches mainly work on the adaptation to samples extracted from original annotated samples. These methods take the object detection and domain adaptation as two independent parts. To train a strong detector with rich synthetic samples, we construct the adaptation to the detection layer of state-of-the-art single-model detectors (SSD and MS-CNN). The training procedure is an end-to-end stage. The classification, location and adaptation are combined in the learning. The performance of the proposed model surpasses the original baseline in our experiments. Meanwhile, our results show that the detectors based on the adversarial adaptation are superior to the detectors based on the discrepancy adaptation. Code will be made publicly available on this http URL

本文提出了一种利用合成烟雾样本进行视频烟雾探测的方法。虚拟数据可以自动提供精确和丰富的注释样本。然而，烟雾表征的学习将受到真实和合成烟雾样本之间的外观差距的伤害。已有的研究主要集中在对原始样本提取的样本进行自适应处理。这些方法将对象检测和域适配作为两个独立的部分。为了训练具有丰富合成样本的强检测器，我们构建了对最先进的单模式检测器（SSD和MS-CNN）的检测层的适应。培训程序是一个端到端的阶段。分类，位置和适应在学习中结合在一起。所提出的模型的性能超过了我们实验中的原始基线。同时，我们的结果表明，基于对抗适应的检测器优于基于差异适应的检测器。代码将在这个http URL上公开
