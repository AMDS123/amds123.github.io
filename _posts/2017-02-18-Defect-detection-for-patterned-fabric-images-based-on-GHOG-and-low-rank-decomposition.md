##### Abstract
In order to accurately detect defects in patterned fabric images, a novel detection algorithm based on Gabor-HOG (GHOG) and low-rank decomposition is proposed in this paper. Defect-free pattern fabric images have the specified direction, while defects damage their regularity of direction. Therefore, a direction-aware descriptor is designed, denoted as GHOG, a combination of Gabor and HOG, which is extremely valuable for localizing the defect region. Upon devising a powerful directional descriptor, an efficient low-rank decomposition model is constructed to divide the matrix generated by the directional feature extracted from image blocks into a low-rank matrix (background information) and a sparse matrix (defect information). A nonconvex log det(.) as a smooth surrogate function for the rank instead of the nuclear norm is also exploited to improve the efficiency of the low-rank model. Moreover, the computational efficiency is further improved by utilizing the alternative direction method of multipliers (ADMM). Thereafter, the saliency map generated by the sparse matrix is segmented via the optimal threshold algorithm to locate the defect regions. Experimental results show that the proposed method can effectively detect patterned fabric defects and outperform the state-of-the-art methods.

为了准确检测图案图像中的缺陷，本文提出了一种基于Gabor-HOG（GHOG）和低秩分解的检测算法。无缺陷图案织物图像具有指定的方向，而缺陷损坏其方向的规律性。因此设计了方向感知描述符，表示为GHOG，Gabor和HOG的组合，对于定位缺陷区域非常有价值。在设计一个强有力的方向描述符时，构造一个高效的低秩分解模型，将由图像块提取的方向性特征生成的矩阵划分为低秩矩阵（背景信息）和稀疏矩阵（缺陷信息）。一个非凸的对数det（。）作为一个平滑的替代核函数的等级替代函数也被用来提高低秩模型的效率。此外，利用乘法器的替代方向法（ADMM）进一步提高了计算效率。之后，通过最优阈值算法对稀疏矩阵生成的显着图进行分割，找出缺陷区域。实验结果表明，所提出的方法可以有效地检测图案织物的缺陷，并超越最先进的方法。
