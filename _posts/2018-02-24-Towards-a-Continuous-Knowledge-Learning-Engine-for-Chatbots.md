##### Abstract
Although chatbots have been very popular in recent years, they still have some serious weaknesses which limit the scope of their applications. One major weakness is that they cannot learn new knowledge during the conversation process, i.e., their knowledge is fixed beforehand and cannot be expanded or updated during conversation. In this paper, we propose to build a general knowledge learning engine for chatbots to enable them to continuously and interactively learn new knowledge during conversations. As time goes by, they become more and more knowledgeable and better and better at learning and conversation. We model the task as an open-world knowledge base completion problem and propose a novel technique called lifelong interactive learning and inference (LiLi) to solve it. LiLi works by imitating how humans acquire knowledge and perform inference during an interactive conversation. Our experimental results show LiLi is highly promising.

尽管近年来聊天机器人非常流行，但它们仍然存在一些严重的缺陷，限制了它们的应用范围。一个主要的弱点是他们不能在对话过程中学习新知识，即他们的知识事先是固定的，不能在对话过程中扩展或更新。在本文中，我们建议为chatbots构建一个通用知识学习引擎，以使他们能够在对话过程中持续交互式地学习新知识。随着时间的推移，他们越来越有知识，在学习和谈话方面越来越好。我们将任务建模为开放式世界知识库完成问题，并提出一种称为终身交互式学习和推理（LiLi）的新技术来解决它。 LiLi通过模仿人类在互动对话期间如何获取知识并进行推理来工作。我们的实验结果表明LiLi具有很高的潜力。
