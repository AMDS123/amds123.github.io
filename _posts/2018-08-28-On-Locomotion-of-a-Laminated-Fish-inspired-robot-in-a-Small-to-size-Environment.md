##### Abstract
Many different robots have been designed and built to work under water. In many cases, researchers have chosen to use bio-inspired platforms. In most cases, the main goal of the fish inspired robots has been set to autonomously swim and maneuver in an environment spacious compared to the fish's size. In this paper, the identification control of a low-cost fish-inspired robot is studied with the goal of building a mechanism to not only swim in water but able to interact with its narrow environment. The robotic fish under study uses tail propulsion as main locomotion. Moreover, proper propulsion regimes are identified and used to model and control thrust generated by propulsion.

已经设计和制造了许多不同的机器人以在水下工作。在许多情况下，研究人员选择使用生物启发平台。在大多数情况下，鱼类机器人的主要目标是在与鱼的大小相比宽敞的环境中自主游泳和操纵。在本文中，研究了低成本鱼类机器人的识别控制，目的是建立一种不仅在水中游泳而且能够与其狭窄环境相互作用的机制。研究中的机器人鱼使用尾部推进作为主要运动。此外，确定了适当的推进机制并用于模拟和控制推进产生的推力。
