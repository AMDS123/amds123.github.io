##### Abstract
We describe a novel extension of soft actor-critics for hierarchical Deep Q-Networks (HDQN) architectures using mutual information metric. The proposed extension provides a suitable framework for encouraging explorations in such hierarchical networks. A natural utilization of this framework is an adversarial setting, where meta-controller and controller play minimax over the mutual information objective but cooperate on maximizing expected rewards.
