##### Abstract
Video surveillance can be significantly enhanced by using both top-view data, e.g., those from drone-mounted cameras in the air, and horizontal-view data, e.g., those from wearable cameras on the ground. Collaborative analysis of different-view data can facilitate various kinds of applications, such as human tracking, person identification, and human activity recognition. However, for such collaborative analysis, the first step is to associate people, referred to as subjects in this paper, across these two views. This is a very challenging problem due to large human-appearance difference between top and horizontal views. In this paper, we present a new approach to address this problem by exploring and matching the subjects' spatial distributions between the two views. More specifically, on the top-view image, we model and match subjects' relative positions to the horizontal-view camera in both views and define a matching cost to decide the actual location of horizontal-view camera and its view angle in the top-view image. We collect a new dataset consisting of top-view and horizontal-view image pairs for performance evaluation and the experimental results show the effectiveness of the proposed method.
