##### Abstract
Traditionally, music was treated as an analogue signal and was generated manually. In recent years, music is conspicuous to technology which can generate a suite of music automatically without any human intervention. To accomplish this task, we need to overcome some technical challenges which are discussed descriptively in this paper. A brief introduction about music and its components is provided in the paper along with the citation and analysis of related work accomplished by different authors in this domain. Main objective of this paper is to propose an algorithm which can be used to generate musical notes using Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), principally Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks. A model is designed to execute this algorithm where data is represented with the help of musical instrument digital interface (MIDI) file format for easier access and better understanding. Preprocessing of data before feeding it into the model, revealing methods to read, process and prepare MIDI files for input are also discussed. The model used in this paper is used to learn the sequences of polyphonic musical notes over a single-layered LSTM network. The model must have the potential to recall past details of a musical sequence and its structure for better learning. Description of layered architecture used in LSTM model and its intertwining connections to develop a neural network is presented in this work. This paper imparts a peek view of distributions of weights and biases in every layer of the model along with a precise representation of losses and accuracy at each step and batches. When the model was thoroughly analyzed, it produced stellar results in composing new melodies.
