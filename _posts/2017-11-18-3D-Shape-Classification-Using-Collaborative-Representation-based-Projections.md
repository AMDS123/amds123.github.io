##### Abstract
A novel 3D shape classification scheme, based on collaborative representation learning, is investigated in this work. A data-driven feature-extraction procedure, taking the form of a simple projection operator, is in the core of our methodology. Provided a shape database, a graph encapsulating the structural relationships among all the available shapes, is first constructed and then employed in defining low-dimensional sparse projections. The recently introduced method of CRPs (collaborative representation based projections), which is based on L2-Graph, is the first variant that is included towards this end. A second algorithm, that particularizes the CRPs to shape descriptors that are inherently nonnegative, is also introduced as potential alternative. In both cases, the weights in the graph reflecting the database structure are calculated so as to approximate each shape as a sparse linear combination of the remaining dataset objects. By way of solving a generalized eigenanalysis problem, a linear matrix operator is designed that will act as the feature extractor. Two popular, inherently high dimensional descriptors, namely ShapeDNA and Global Point Signature (GPS), are employed in our experimentations with SHREC10, SHREC11 and SCHREC 15 datasets, where shape recognition is cast as a multi-class classification problem that is tackled by means of an SVM (support vector machine) acting within the reduced dimensional space of the crafted projections. The results are very promising and outperform state of the art methods, providing evidence about the highly discriminative nature of the introduced 3D shape representations.

本文研究了一种新的基于协作表示学习的三维形状分类方案。采用简单的投影算子形式的数据驱动特征提取程序是我们方法论的核心。提供了一个形状数据库，首先构造一个包含所有可用形状之间的结构关系的图形，然后用于定义低维稀疏投影。最近引入的基于L2-Graph的CRP（基于协作表示的投影）方法是为此目的而包含的第一个变体。第二种算法将CRP描述成本质上非负的描述符，也被引入作为潜在的替代方案。在这两种情况下，计算反映数据库结构的图中的权重，以便将每个形状近似为剩余数据集对象的稀疏线性组合。通过求解广义特征分析问题，设计了一个线性矩阵算子作为特征提取器。在我们的SHREC10，SHREC11和SCHREC15数据集的实验中，使用了两种流行的，固有的高维度描述符，即ShapeDNA和Global Point Signature（GPS），其中形状识别被归类为多类分类问题，通过SVM（支持向量机）在制作的投影的缩小尺寸空间内起作用。结果是非常有前途的并且胜过现有技术的方法，提供了关于所引入的3D形状表示的高度区分性质的证据。
