##### Abstract
This paper presents a novel approach for automatic recognition of human activities for video surveillance applications. We propose to represent an activity by a combination of category components, and demonstrate that this approach offers flexibility to add new activities to the system and an ability to deal with the problem of building models for activities lacking training data. For improving the recognition accuracy, a Confident-Frame- based Recognition algorithm is also proposed, where the video frames with high confidence for recognizing an activity are used as a specialized local model to help classify the remainder of the video frames. Experimental results show the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

本文提出了一种自动识别视频监控应用中的人类活动的新方法。我们建议通过组合类别组件来表示活动，并且证明这种方法提供了向系统添加新活动的灵活性，并且能够处理缺乏训练数据的活动的模型构建问题。为了提高识别的准确性，还提出了基于自适应帧的识别算法，其中具有高置信度的用于识别活动的视频帧被用作专门的本地模型来帮助分类视频帧的其余部分。实验结果表明了该方法的有效性。
