##### Abstract
Estimating 3D human pose from monocular images demands large amounts of 3D pose and in-the-wild 2D pose annotated datasets which are costly and require sophisticated systems to acquire. In this regard, we propose a metric learning based approach to jointly learn a rich embedding and 3D pose regression from the embedding using multi-view synchronised videos of human motions and very limited 3D pose annotations. The inclusion of metric learning to the baseline pose estimation framework improves the performance by 21\% when 3D supervision is limited. In addition, we make use of a person-identity based adversarial loss as additional weak supervision to outperform state-of-the-art whilst using a much smaller network. Lastly, but importantly, we demonstrate the advantages of the learned embedding and establish view-invariant pose retrieval benchmarks on two popular, publicly available multi-view human pose datasets, Human 3.6M and MPI-INF-3DHP, to facilitate future research.
