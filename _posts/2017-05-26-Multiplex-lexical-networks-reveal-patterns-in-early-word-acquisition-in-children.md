##### Abstract
Network models of language have provided a way of linking cognitive processes to the structure and connectivity of language. However, one shortcoming of current approaches is focusing on only one type of linguistic relationship at a time, missing the complex multi-relational nature of language. In this work, we overcome this limitation by modelling the mental lexicon of English-speaking toddlers as a multiplex lexical network, i.e. a multi-layered network where N=529 words/nodes are connected according to four types of relationships: (i) free associations, (ii) feature sharing, (iii) co-occurrence, and (iv) phonological similarity. We provide analysis of the topology of the resulting multiplex and then proceed to evaluate single layers as well as the full multiplex structure on their ability to predict empirically observed age of acquisition data of English speaking toddlers. We find that the emerging multiplex network topology is an important proxy of the cognitive processes of acquisition, capable of capturing emergent lexicon structure. In fact, we show that the multiplex topology is fundamentally more powerful than individual layers in predicting the ordering with which words are acquired. Furthermore, multiplex analysis allows for a quantification of distinct phases of lexical acquisition in early learners: while initially all the multiplex layers contribute to word learning, after about month 23 free associations take the lead in driving word acquisition.

语言的网络模型提供了一种将认知过程与语言的结构和连通性联系起来的方式。然而，目前的方法的一个缺点是一次只关注一种类型的语言关系，而忽略了语言复杂的多关系性质。在这项工作中，我们通过将英语幼儿的心理词典建模为多元词汇网络（即，N = 529个词/节点根据四种类型的关系连接的多层网络）来克服该限制：（i）免费（ii）特征共享，（iii）同现，和（iv）语音相似性。我们提供分析所得到的多路复用的拓扑结构，然后着手评估单层以及完整的多路复用结构的能力，以预测英语幼儿采集数据的经验观察年龄。我们发现，新兴的复用网络拓扑结构是获取认知过程的重要代表，能够捕捉到新兴的词汇结构。事实上，我们表明，多元拓扑结构在预测单词获取顺序方面比单独的层次更为强大。此外，多元分析可以对早期学习者的词汇习得的不同阶段进行量化：尽管最初所有的多元层次都有助于词汇学习，但在大约23个月后，自由联想率先驱动了词汇习得。
