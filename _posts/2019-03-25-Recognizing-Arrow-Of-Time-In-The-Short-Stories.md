##### Abstract
Recognizing arrow of time in short stories is a challenging task. i.e., given only two paragraphs, determining which comes first and which comes next is a difficult task even for humans. In this paper, we have collected and curated a novel dataset for tackling this challenging task. We have shown that a pre-trained BERT architecture achieves reasonable accuracy on the task, and outperforms RNN-based architectures.
