##### Abstract
Context categorization is a fundamental pre-requisite for multi-domain multimedia content analysis applications in order to manage contextual information in an efficient manner. In this paper, we introduce a new color image context categorization method (DITEC) based on the trace transform. The problem of dimensionality reduction of the obtained trace transform signal is addressed through statistical descriptors that keep the underlying information. These extracted features offer a highly discriminant behavior for content categorization. The theoretical properties of the method are analyzed and validated experimentally through two different datasets.
