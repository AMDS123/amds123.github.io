##### Abstract
Deep convolutional neural networks follow roughly the architecture of biological visual systems, and have shown a performance comparable to human observers in object recognition tasks. In this study, I test a pre-trained deep neural network in some classic visual search tasks. The results reveal a qualitative difference from human performance. It appears that there is no difference between searches for simple features that pop out in experiments with humans, and for feature configurations that exhibit strict capacity limitations in human vision. Both types of stimuli reveal moderate capacity limitations in the neural network tested here.
