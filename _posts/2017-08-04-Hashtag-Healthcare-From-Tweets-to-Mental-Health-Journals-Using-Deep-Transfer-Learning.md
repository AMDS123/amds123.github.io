##### Abstract
As the popularity of social media platforms continues to rise, an ever-increasing amount of human communication and self- expression takes place online. Most recent research has focused on mining social media for public user opinion about external entities such as product reviews or sentiment towards political news. However, less attention has been paid to analyzing users' internalized thoughts and emotions from a mental health perspective. In this paper, we quantify the semantic difference between public Tweets and private mental health journals used in online cognitive behavioral therapy. We will use deep transfer learning techniques for analyzing the semantic gap between the two domains. We show that for the task of emotional valence prediction, social media can be successfully harnessed to create more accurate, robust, and personalized mental health models. Our results suggest that the semantic gap between public and private self-expression is small, and that utilizing the abundance of available social media is one way to overcome the small sample sizes of mental health data, which are commonly limited by availability and privacy concerns.

随着社交媒体平台的普及程度不断提高，越来越多的人际交流和自我表达在网上进行。最近的研究主要集中在挖掘社交媒体，让公众用户对外部实体（如产品评论或对政治新闻的看法）进行评论。然而，从心理健康的角度来分析用户的内化的思想和情绪的关注度较低。在本文中，我们量化在线认知行为治疗中使用的公共推文和私人心理健康期刊之间的语义差异。我们将使用深度转移学习技术来分析两个领域之间的语义鸿沟。我们表明，对于情绪效价预测的任务，社交媒体可以成功地用来创建更准确，健壮，个性化的心理健康模型。我们的研究结果表明，公共和私人自我表达之间的语义差距很小，而利用大量现有社交媒体是克服心理健康数据的小样本量的一种方法，这通常受到可用性和隐私问题的限制。
