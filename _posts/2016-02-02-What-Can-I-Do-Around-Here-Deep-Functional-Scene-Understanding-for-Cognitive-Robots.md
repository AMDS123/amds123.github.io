##### Abstract
For robots that have the capability to interact with the physical environment through their end effectors, understanding the surrounding scenes is not merely a task of image classification or object recognition. To perform actual tasks, it is critical for the robot to have a functional understanding of the visual scene. Here, we address the problem of localizing and recognition of functional areas from an arbitrary indoor scene, formulated as a two-stage deep learning based detection pipeline. A new scene functionality testing-bed, which is complied from two publicly available indoor scene datasets, is used for evaluation. Our method is evaluated quantitatively on the new dataset, demonstrating the ability to perform efficient recognition of functional areas from arbitrary indoor scenes. We also demonstrate that our detection model can be generalized onto novel indoor scenes by cross validating it with the images from two different datasets.

对于能够通过末端执行器与物理环境进行交互的机器人，理解周围的场景不仅仅是图像分类或对象识别的任务。为了执行实际任务，机器人必须对视觉场景有一个功能性的理解。在这里，我们解决从任意室内场景定位和识别功能区域的问题，制定为基于两阶段深度学习的检测管道。使用由两个公开可用的室内场景数据集编制的新的场景功能测试台进行评估。我们的方法在新的数据集上进行了定量评估，展示了从任意室内场景高效识别功能区域的能力。我们还证明，我们的检测模型可以推广到新颖的室内场景交叉验证与两个不同的数据集的图像。
