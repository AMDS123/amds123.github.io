##### Abstract
In the present paper, we try to propose a self-similar network theory for the basic understanding. By extending the natural languages to a kind of so called idealy sufficient language, we can proceed a few steps to the investigation of the language searching and the language understanding of AI. 
 Image understanding, and the familiarity of the brain to the surrounding environment are also discussed. Group effects are discussed by addressing the essense of the power of influences, and constructing the influence network of a society. We also give a discussion of inspirations.

##### Abstract (translated by Google)
在本文中，我们试图提出一个自相似的网络理论来进行基本的理解。通过将自然语言扩展为一种所谓的理想充足的语言，我们可以进一步对AI的语言检索和语言理解进行研究。
 还讨论了图像理解以及大脑对周围环境的熟悉程度。通过解决影响力的本质，构建社会影响网络来论述群体效应。我们也对灵感进行讨论。
