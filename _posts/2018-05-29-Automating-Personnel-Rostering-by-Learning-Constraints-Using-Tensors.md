##### Abstract
Many problems in operations research require that constraints be specified in the model. Determining the right constraints is a hard and laborsome task. We propose an approach to automate this process using artificial intelligence and machine learning principles. So far there has been only little work on learning constraints within the operations research community. We focus on personnel rostering and scheduling problems in which there are often past schedules available and show that it is possible to automatically learn constraints from such examples. To realize this, we adapted some techniques from the constraint programming community and we have extended them in order to cope with multidimensional examples. The method uses a tensor representation of the example, which helps in capturing the dimensionality as well as the structure of the example, and applies tensor operations to find the constraints that are satisfied by the example. To evaluate the proposed algorithm, we used constraints from the Nurse Rostering Competition and generated solutions that satisfy these constraints; these solutions were then used as examples to learn constraints. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed algorithm is capable of producing human readable constraints that capture the underlying characteristics of the examples.

运营研究中的许多问题需要在模型中指定约束条件。确定正确的限制是一项艰巨而艰巨的任务。我们提出了一种使用人工智能和机器学习原理来自动化这一过程的方法。到目前为止，运营研究界对于学习障碍的研究一直很少。我们关注人员排班和排班问题，其中通常有过去的时间表可用，并显示可以自动学习这些示例中的约束条件。为了实现这一点，我们调整了约束规划社区的一些技术，并且我们扩展了它们以应对多维范例。该方法使用示例的张量表示，这有助于捕获示例的维度和结构，并应用张量操作来查找示例满足的约束。为了评估所提出的算法，我们使用了护士集会竞赛中的约束并生成满足这些约束的解决方案;然后将这些解决方案用作示例来学习约束条件。实验表明，所提出的算法能够产生人类可读的约束，以捕捉示例的基本特征。
