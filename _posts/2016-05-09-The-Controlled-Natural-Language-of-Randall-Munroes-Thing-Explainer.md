##### Abstract
It is rare that texts or entire books written in a Controlled Natural Language (CNL) become very popular, but exactly this has happened with a book that has been published last year. Randall Munroe's Thing Explainer uses only the 1'000 most often used words of the English language together with drawn pictures to explain complicated things such as nuclear reactors, jet engines, the solar system, and dishwashers. This restricted language is a very interesting new case for the CNL community. I describe here its place in the context of existing approaches on Controlled Natural Languages, and I provide a first analysis from a scientific perspective, covering the word production rules and word distributions.

##### Abstract (translated by Google)
用受控自然语言（CNL）编写的文本或整本书很少受到欢迎，但是去年出版的一本书就是如此。 Randall Munroe的“Thing Explainer”仅使用了英语中最常用的1000个单词和绘制的图片来解释诸如核反应堆，喷气发动机，太阳系和洗碗机等复杂的事物。这种限制性语言对于CNL社区来说是一个非常有趣的新例子。我在这里描述了它在现有控制自然语言方法中的地位，我从科学的角度提供了第一个分析，包括生产规则和词分布。
