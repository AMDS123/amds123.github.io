##### Abstract
This paper focus on recovering multi-dimensional data called tensor from randomly corrupted incomplete observation. Inspired by reweighted $l_1$ norm minimization for sparsity enhancement, this paper proposes a reweighted singular value enhancement scheme to improve tensor low tubular rank in the tensor completion process. An efficient iterative decomposition scheme based on t-SVD is proposed which improves low-rank signal recovery significantly. The effectiveness of the proposed method is established by applying to video completion problem, and experimental results reveal that the algorithm outperforms its counterparts.

本文着重于从随机损坏的不完全观测中恢复称为张量的多维数据。为了提高稀疏性，本文提出了一种重新加权的奇异值增强方案，以改善张量完成过程中张量低的管状排列。提出了一种基于t-SVD的高效迭代分解方法，大大改善了低秩信号的恢复。通过对视频完成问题的分析，建立了该方法的有效性，实验结果表明该算法优于其他方法。
