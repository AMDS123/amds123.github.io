##### Abstract
Prominences and boundaries are the essential constituents of prosodic structure in speech. They provide for means to chunk the speech stream into linguistically relevant units by providing them with relative saliences and demarcating them within coherent utterance structures. Prominences and boundaries have both been widely used in both basic research on prosody as well as in text-to-speech synthesis. However, there are no representation schemes that would provide for both estimating and modelling them in a unified fashion. Here we present an unsupervised unified account for estimating and representing prosodic prominences and boundaries using a scale-space analysis based on continuous wavelet transform. The methods are evaluated and compared to earlier work using the Boston University Radio News corpus. The results show that the proposed method is comparable with the best published supervised annotation methods.

##### Abstract (translated by Google)
突出和界限是言语中韵律结构的基本组成部分。它们提供了将语音流分成语言相关单元的手段，方法是给语言流提供相对的显着性，并在连贯的话语结构中划分它们。在韵律和文本到语音合成的基础研究中，突出和界限都被广泛使用。但是，没有任何代表方案可以统一估计和建模。在这里我们提出一个无监督统一帐户估计和表示韵律突出和边界使用基于连续小波变换的尺度空间分析。这些方法经过评估，并与使用波士顿大学电台新闻语料库的早期工作进行了比较。结果表明，该方法与已发表的最佳监督方法具有可比性。
