##### Abstract
This paper studies the problem of how to choose good viewpoints for taking photographs of architectures. We achieve this by learning from professional photographs of world famous landmarks that are available on the Internet. Unlike previous efforts devoted to photo quality assessment which mainly rely on 2D image features, we show in this paper combining 2D image features extracted from images with 3D geometric features computed on the 3D models can result in more reliable evaluation of viewpoint quality. Specifically, we collect a set of photographs for each of 15 world famous architectures as well as their 3D models from the Internet. Viewpoint recovery for images is carried out through an image-model registration process, after which a newly proposed viewpoint clustering strategy is exploited to validate users' viewpoint preferences when photographing landmarks. Finally, we extract a number of 2D and 3D features for each image based on multiple visual and geometric cues and perform viewpoint recommendation by learning from both 2D and 3D features using a specifically designed SVM-2K multi-view learner, achieving superior performance over using solely 2D or 3D features. We show the effectiveness of the proposed approach through extensive experiments. The experiments also demonstrate that our system can be used to recommend viewpoints for rendering textured 3D models of buildings for the use of architectural design, in addition to viewpoint evaluation of photographs and recommendation of viewpoints for photographing architectures in practice.

本文研究如何选择好的观点拍摄建筑。我们通过从互联网上可用的世界着名地标的专业照片学习，实现这一目标。与以前主要依靠二维图像特征进行图像质量评估的工作不同，本文将从图像中提取的二维图像特征与在三维模型上计算的三维几何特征相结合，可以得到更可靠的视点质量评估结果。具体而言，我们收集了15个世界着名建筑的每一幅照片以及来自互联网的3D模型。通过图像模型注册过程进行图像的视点恢复，然后利用新提出的视点聚类策略来验证用户在拍摄地标时的视点偏好。最后，我们基于多个视觉和几何线索为每个图像提取许多二维和三维特征，并通过使用专门设计的SVM-2K多视图学习器从二维和三维特征进行学习来执行视点推荐，实现优于使用只有2D或3D功能。我们通过大量的实验来展示所提出的方法的有效性。实验还证明，除了照片的视点评估和实践中的摄影架构的观点推荐之外，我们的系统还可以用于建议用于建筑物的纹理化3D模型的视点以用于建筑设计。
