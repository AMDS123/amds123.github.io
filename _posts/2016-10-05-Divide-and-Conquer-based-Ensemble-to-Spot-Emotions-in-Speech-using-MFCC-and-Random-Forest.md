##### Abstract
Besides spoken words, speech signals also carry information about speaker gender, age, and emotional state which can be used in a variety of speech analysis applications. In this paper, a divide and conquer strategy for ensemble classification has been proposed to recognize emotions in speech. Intrinsic hierarchy in emotions has been utilized to construct an emotions tree, which assisted in breaking down the emotion recognition task into smaller sub tasks. The proposed framework generates predictions in three phases. Firstly, emotions are detected in the input speech signal by classifying it as neutral or emotional. If the speech is classified as emotional, then in the second phase, it is further classified into positive and negative classes. Finally, individual positive or negative emotions are identified based on the outcomes of the previous stages. Several experiments have been performed on a widely used benchmark dataset. The proposed method was able to achieve improved recognition rates as compared to several other approaches.

##### Abstract (translated by Google)
语音信号除了口头语言之外，还带有关于说话者性别，年龄和情绪状态的信息，可用于各种语音分析应用。本文提出了集合分类的分治策略来识别言语中的情绪。已经利用情感的内在层次结构来构建情感树，帮助将情感识别任务分解为更小的子任务。拟议框架分三个阶段产生预测。首先，通过将输入语音信号分类为中性或情感来检测情绪。如果讲话被分类为情感，那么在第二阶段，则进一步分为正面和负面。最后，根据以前阶段的结果确定个人的积极或消极情绪。已经在广泛使用的基准数据集上进行了几个实验。与其他几种方法相比，所提出的方法能够提高识别率。
