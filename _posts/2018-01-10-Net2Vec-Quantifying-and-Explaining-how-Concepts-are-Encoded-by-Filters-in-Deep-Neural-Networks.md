##### Abstract
In an effort to understand the meaning of the intermediate representations captured by deep networks, recent papers have tried to associate specific semantic concepts to individual neural network filter responses, where interesting correlations are often found, largely by focusing on extremal filter responses. In this paper, we show that this approach can favor easy-to-interpret cases that are not necessarily representative of the average behavior of a representation. A more realistic but harder-to-study hypothesis is that semantic representations are distributed, and thus filters must be studied in conjunction. In order to investigate this idea while enabling systematic visualization and quantification of multiple filter responses, we introduce the Net2Vec framework, in which semantic concepts are mapped to vectorial embeddings based on corresponding filter responses. By studying such embeddings, we are able to show that 1., in most cases, multiple filters are required to code for a concept, that 2., often filters are not concept specific and help encode multiple concepts, and that 3., compared to single filter activations, filter embeddings are able to better characterize the meaning of a representation and its relationship to other concepts.

为了理解深度网络捕获的中间表示的含义，最近的论文试图将特定的语义概念与单个神经网络滤波器响应相关联，其中通常发现有趣的相关性，主要通过关注极值滤波器响应。在本文中，我们表明，这种方法可以倾向于易于解释的情况下，不一定代表一个表示的平均行为。一个更现实但更难研究的假设是语义表示是分布式的，因此过滤器必须联合研究。为了研究这个思想，同时实现多个滤波器响应的系统可视化和量化，我们引入了Net2Vec框架，其中基于相应的滤波器响应将语义概念映射到向量嵌入。通过研究这样的嵌入，我们能够证明1.在大多数情况下，需要多个过滤器来编码一个概念，2.通常过滤器不是概念特定的并且帮助对多个概念进行编码，3.比较到单个过滤器激活，过滤器嵌入能够更好地表征表示的意义及其与其他概念的关系。
