##### Abstract
This paper presents a novel method to recognize stem - calyx of an apple using shape descriptors. The main drawback of existing apple grading techniques is that stem - calyx part of an apple is treated as defects, this leads to poor grading of apples. In order to overcome this drawback, we proposed an approach to recognize stem-calyx and differentiated from true defects based on shape features. Our method comprises of steps such as segmentation of apple using grow-cut method, candidate objects such as stem-calyx and small defects are detected using multi-threshold segmentation. The shape features are extracted from detected objects using Multifractal, Fourier and Radon descriptor and finally stem-calyx regions are recognized and differentiated from true defects using SVM classifier. The proposed algorithm is evaluated using experiments conducted on apple image dataset and results exhibit considerable improvement in recognition of stem-calyx region compared to other techniques.

本文提出了一种利用形状描述符识别苹果茎萼的新方法。现有的苹果分级技术的主要缺点是苹果的茎萼部分被视为缺陷，导致苹果分级不佳。为了克服这个缺点，我们提出了一种基于形状特征识别茎萼并区分真正缺陷的方法。我们的方法包括使用生长切割方法分割苹果，使用多阈值分割来检测诸如茎萼和小缺陷的候选对象。利用多重分形，Fourier和Radon描述子从检测对象中提取形状特征，最后利用支持向量机分类器识别茎萼区域并区分真正的缺陷。所提出的算法通过在苹果图像数据集上进行的实验进行评估，并且与其他技术相比，结果显示在茎萼区域的识别方面有相当大的改进。
