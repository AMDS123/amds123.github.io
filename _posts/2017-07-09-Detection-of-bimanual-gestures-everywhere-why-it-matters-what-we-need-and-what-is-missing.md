##### Abstract
Bimanual gestures are of the utmost importance for the study of motor coordination in humans and in everyday activities. A reliable detection of bimanual gestures in unconstrained environments is fundamental for their clinical study and to assess common activities of daily living. This paper investigates techniques for a reliable, unconstrained detection and classification of bimanual gestures. It assumes the availability of inertial data originating from the two hands/arms, builds upon a previously developed technique for gesture modelling based on Gaussian Mixture Modelling (GMM) and Gaussian Mixture Regression (GMR), and compares different modelling and classification techniques, which are based on a number of assumptions inspired by literature about how bimanual gestures are represented and modelled in the brain. Experiments show results related to 5 everyday bimanual activities, which have been selected on the basis of three main parameters: (not) constraining the two hands by a physical tool, (not) requiring a specific sequence of single-hand gestures, being recursive (or not). In the best performing combination of modeling approach and classification technique, five out of five activities are recognized up to an accuracy of 97%, a precision of 82% and a level of recall of 100%.

双手手势对于研究人类和日常活动中的运动协调至关重要。在不受约束的环境中可靠地检测双手手势对于他们的临床研究和评估日常生活中的普通活动是基础的。本文研究了一种可靠的，无约束的双手势检测和分类技术。它假定来自双手/手臂的惯性数据的可用性，基于先前开发的基于高斯混合建模（GMM）和高斯混合回归（GMR）的手势建模技术，并且比较了不同的建模和分类技术基于大量的文学启发，假设如何在双脑中表现和仿效双手手势。实验显示了与5种双手双手活动有关的结果，这些活动是根据三个主要参数选择的：（不）通过物理工具约束双手，（不）要求单手手势的特定顺序，递归或不）。在建模方法和分类技术的最佳表现组合中，五分之五的活动被识别达到97％的准确度，82％的准确度和100％的召回水平。
