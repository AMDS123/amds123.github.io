##### Abstract
As one kind of skin cancer, melanoma is very dangerous. Dermoscopy based early detection and recarbonization strategy is critical for melanoma therapy. However, well-trained dermatologists dominant the diagnostic accuracy. In order to solve this problem, many effort focus on developing automatic image analysis systems. Here we report a novel strategy based on deep learning technique, and achieve very high skin lesion segmentation and melanoma diagnosis accuracy: 1) we build a segmentation neural network (skin_segnn), which achieved very high lesion boundary detection accuracy; 2) We build another very deep neural network based on Google inception v3 network (skin_recnn) and its well-trained weight. The novel designed transfer learning based deep neural network skin_inceptions_v3_nn helps to achieve a high prediction accuracy.

作为一种皮肤癌，黑色素瘤是非常危险的。基于皮肤镜的早期检测和再碳化策略对于黑素瘤治疗是至关重要的。但是，训练有素的皮肤科医生主导诊断的准确性。为了解决这个问题，许多努力集中在开发自动图像分析系统。在这里，我们报告了一种基于深度学习技术的新型策略，实现了非常高的皮肤病灶分割和黑色素瘤诊断的准确性：1）建立了一个分割神经网络（skin_segnn），实现了非常高的病灶边界检测精度; 2）我们基于Google初始v3网络（skin_recnn）以及训练有素的权重构建另一个非常深的神经网络。新设计的基于深度神经网络skin_inceptions_v3_nn的转移学习有助于实现较高的预测精度。
