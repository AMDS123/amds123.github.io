##### Abstract
Manifold amount of video data gets generated every minute as we read this document, ranging from surveillance to broadcasting purposes. There are two roadblocks that restrain us from using this data as such, first being the storage which restricts us from only storing the information based on the hardware constraints. Secondly, the computation required to process this data is highly expensive which makes it infeasible to work on them. Compressive sensing(CS)[2] is a signal process technique[11], through optimization, the sparsity of a signal can be exploited to recover it from far fewer samples than required by the Shannon-Nyquist sampling theorem. There are two conditions under which recovery is possible. The first one is sparsity which requires the signal to be sparse in some domain. The second one is incoherence which is applied through the isometric property which is sufficient for sparse signals[9][10]. To sustain these characteristics, preserving all attributes in the uncompressed domain would help any kind of in this field. However, existing dataset fallback in terms of continuous tracking of all the object present in the scene, very few video datasets have comprehensive continuous tracking of objects. To address these problems collectively, in this work we propose a new comprehensive video dataset, where the data is compressed using pixel-wise coded exposure [3] that resolves various other impediments.
