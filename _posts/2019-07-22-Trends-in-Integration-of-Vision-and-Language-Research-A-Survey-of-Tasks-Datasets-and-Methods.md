##### Abstract
Integration of vision and language tasks has seen a significant growth in the recent times due to surge of interest from multi-disciplinary communities such as deep learning, computer vision, and natural language processing. In this survey, we focus on ten different vision and language integration tasks in terms of their problem formulation, methods, existing datasets, evaluation measures, and comparison of results achieved with the corresponding state-of-the-art methods. This goes beyond earlier surveys which are either task-specific or concentrate only on one type of visual content i.e., image or video. We then conclude the survey by discussing some possible future directions for integration of vision and language research.
