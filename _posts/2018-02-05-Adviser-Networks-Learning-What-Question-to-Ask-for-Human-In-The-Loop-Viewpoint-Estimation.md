##### Abstract
Humans have an unparalleled visual intelligence and can overcome visual ambiguities that machines currently cannot. Recent works have shown that incorporating guidance from humans during inference for real-world, challenging tasks like viewpoint-estimation and fine-grained classification, can help overcome difficult cases in which the computer-alone would have otherwise failed. These hybrid intelligence approaches are hence gaining traction. However, deciding what question to ask the human in the loop at inference time remains an unknown for these problems. 
 We address this question by formulating it as what we call the Adviser Problem: can we learn a mapping from the input to a specific question to ask the human in the loop so as to maximize the expected positive impact to the overall task? We formulate a solution to the adviser problem using a deep network and apply it to the viewpoint estimation problem where the question asks for the location of a specific keypoint in the input image. We show that by using the keypoint guidance from the Adviser Network and the human, the model is able to outperform the previous hybrid-intelligence state-of-the-art by 3.27%, and outperform the computer-only state-of-the-art by 10.44% absolute.

人类具有无与伦比的视觉智能，可以克服机器目前无法实现的视觉模糊。最近的研究表明，在推断现实世界中具有挑战性的任务（如观点估计和细粒度分类）时，结合人类指导可以帮助克服计算机本来会失败的困难情况。这些混合智能方法正在获得牵引力。然而，决定什么问题在循环中要求推理时间仍然是未知的这些问题。
 我们把这个问题作为我们所说的顾问问题来解决：我们可以学习从输入到特定问题的一个映射，要求循环中的人，从而最大化对整个任务的预期的积极影响？我们使用深度网络制定顾问问题的解决方案，并将其应用于问题要求输入图像中特定关键点的位置的视点估计问题。我们表明，通过使用顾问网络和人的关键点指导，该模型能够比之前的3.27％的混合智能科技水平跑赢大众，艺术绝对是10.44％。
