##### Abstract
Grazing incidence anomalous x-ray scattering was used to monitor in situ the molecular beam epitaxy growth of GaN/AlN quantum dots (QDs). The strain state was studied by means of grazing incidence Multi-wavelength Anomalous Di raction (MAD) in both the QDs and the AlN during the progressive coverage of QDs by AlN monolayers. Vertical correlation in the position of the GaN QDs was also studied by both grazing incidence MAD and anomalous Grazing Incidence Small Angle Scattering (GISAXS) as a function of the number of GaN planes and of the AlN spacer thickness. In a regime where the GaN QDs and the AlN capping are mutually strain influenced, a vertical correlation in the position of QDs is found with as a side-e ect an average increase in the QDs width.
