##### Abstract
Saliency integration approaches have aroused general concern on unifying saliency maps from multiple saliency models. In fact, saliency integration is a weighted aggregation of multiple saliency maps, such that measuring the weights of saliency models is essential. In this paper, we propose an unsupervised model for saliency integration, namely the arbitrator model (AM), based on the Bayes' probability theory. The proposed AM incorporates saliency models of varying expertise and a prior map based on the consistency of the evidence from multiple saliency models and a reference saliency map from generally accepted knowledge. Also, we suggest two methods to learn the expertise of the saliency models without ground truth. The experimental results are from various combinations of twenty-two state-of-the-art saliency models on five datasets. The evaluation results show that the AM model improves the performance substantially compared to the existing state-of-the-art approaches, regardless of the chosen candidate saliency models.

显着性整合方法引起了人们普遍关注的从多个显着性模型中统一显着性图。事实上，显着性整合是多重显着性图的加权聚合，因此测量显着性模型的权重是至关重要的。在本文中，我们提出了一个基于贝叶斯概率理论的显式整合的无监督模型，即仲裁模型（AM）。所提出的AM基于来自多个显着性模型的证据和来自普遍接受的知识的参考显着性图的一致性，合并不同专业知识的显着性模型和先验图。此外，我们建议两种方法来学习没有基本事实的显着性模型的专业知识。实验结果来自五个数据集上二十二个最先进的显着性模型的各种组合。评估结果表明，与现有技术的方法相比，AM模型大大提高了性能，而不管所选择的候选显着性模型如何。
