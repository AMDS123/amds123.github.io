##### Abstract
Lexical sets contain the words filling the argument positions of a verb in one of its senses. They can be grounded empirically through their automatic extraction from corpora. The purpose of this paper is demonstrating that their vector representation based on word embedding provides insights onto many linguistic phenomena, and in particular about verbs undergoing the causative-inchoative alternation. A first experiment aims at investigating the internal structure of the sets, which are known to be radial and continuous categories cognitively. A second experiment shows that the distance between the subject set and object set is correlated with a semantic factor, namely the spontaneity of the verb.

词汇集包含填充一个动词的参数位置的单词。他们可以通过从语料库自动提取经验基础。本文的目的是证明他们的基于词语嵌入的向量表示提供了许多语言现象的见解，特别是关于经历使役行为的动词。第一个实验旨在调查集合的内部结构，这些集合被认为是认知上的径向和连续的类别。第二个实验表明，主语集合和宾语集合之间的距离与语义因素（即动词的自发性）相关。
