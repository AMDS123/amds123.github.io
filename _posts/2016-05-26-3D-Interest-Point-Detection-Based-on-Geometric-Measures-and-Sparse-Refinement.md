##### Abstract
Three dimensional (3D) interest point detection plays a fundamental role in computer vision. In this paper, we introduce a new method for detecting 3D interest points of 3D mesh models based on geometric measures and sparse refinement (GMSR). The key point of our approach is to calculate the 3D saliency measure using two novel geometric measures, which are defined in multi-scale space to effectively distinguish 3D interest points from edges and flat areas. Those points with local maxima of 3D saliency measure are selected as the candidates of 3D interest points. Finally, we utilize an $l_0$ norm based optimization method to refine the candidates of 3D interest points by constraining the number of 3D interest points. Numerical experiments show that the proposed GMSR based 3D interest point detector outperforms current six state-of-the-art methods for different kinds of 3D mesh models.

三维（3D）兴趣点检测在计算机视觉中扮演着重要的角色。本文介绍了一种基于几何量度和稀疏精细（GMSR）的三维网格三维兴趣点检测方法。我们的方法的关键在于使用两个在多尺度空间中定义的几何量度来计算三维显着性度量，以有效地区分来自边缘和平坦区域的三维兴趣点。选择三维显着性度量的局部极大点作为三维兴趣点的候选点。最后，我们利用基于$ l_0 $范数的优化方法通过约束3D兴趣点的数量来优化3D兴趣点的候选。数值实验表明，所提出的基于GMSR的三维兴趣点检测器优于目前六种最先进的方法，用于不同类型的3D网格模型。
