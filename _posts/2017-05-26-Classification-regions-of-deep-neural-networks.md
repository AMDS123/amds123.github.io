##### Abstract
The goal of this paper is to analyze the geometric properties of deep neural network classifiers in the input space. We specifically study the topology of classification regions created by deep networks, as well as their associated decision boundary. Through a systematic empirical investigation, we show that state-of-the-art deep nets learn connected classification regions, and that the decision boundary in the vicinity of datapoints is flat along most directions. We further draw an essential connection between two seemingly unrelated properties of deep networks: their sensitivity to additive perturbations in the inputs, and the curvature of their decision boundary. The directions where the decision boundary is curved in fact remarkably characterize the directions to which the classifier is the most vulnerable. We finally leverage a fundamental asymmetry in the curvature of the decision boundary of deep nets, and propose a method to discriminate between original images, and images perturbed with small adversarial examples. We show the effectiveness of this purely geometric approach for detecting small adversarial perturbations in images, and for recovering the labels of perturbed images.

本文的目的是分析输入空间中深度神经网络分类器的几何特性。我们具体研究由深度网络创建的分类区域的拓扑以及它们相关的决策边界。通过系统的实证研究，我们发现最先进的深网络学习连通分类区域，数据点附近的判定边界沿大多数方向是平坦的。我们进一步在深度网络的两个表面上不相关的属性之间绘制了一个重要的联系：它们对输入中的附加扰动的敏感性以及它们的决策边界的曲率。决定边界弯曲的方向实际上明显地表征了分类器最脆弱的方向。最后，利用深网决策边界曲率的基本不对称性，提出了一种区分原始图像和小扰动图像的方法。我们展示了这种纯粹的几何方法检测图像中的小对抗干扰和恢复干扰图像的标签的有效性。
