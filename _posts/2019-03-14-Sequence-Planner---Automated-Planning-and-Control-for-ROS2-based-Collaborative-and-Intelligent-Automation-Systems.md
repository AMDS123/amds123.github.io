##### Abstract
Systems based on the Robot Operating System (ROS) are easy to extend with new on-line algorithms and devices. However, there is relatively little support for coordinating a large number of heterogeneous sub-systems. In this paper we propose an architecture to model and control collaborative and intelligent automation systems in a hierarchical fashion.
