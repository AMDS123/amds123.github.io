##### Abstract
Systematic experimental data on resonant inelastic X-ray scattering (RIXS) in GaN near the N K-edge are presented for the first time. Excitation energy dependence of the spectral structures manifests the band structure effects originating from momentum selectivity of the RIXS process. This finding allows obtaining k-resolved band structure information for GaN crystals and nanostructures.
