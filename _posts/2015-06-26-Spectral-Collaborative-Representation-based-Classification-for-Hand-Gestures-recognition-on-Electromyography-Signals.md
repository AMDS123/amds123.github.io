##### Abstract
In this study, we introduce a novel variant and application of the Collaborative Representation based Classification in spectral domain for recognition of the hand gestures using the raw surface Electromyography signals. The intuitive use of spectral features are explained via circulant matrices. The proposed Spectral Collaborative Representation based Classification (SCRC) is able to recognize gestures with higher levels of accuracy for a fairly rich gesture set. The worst recognition result which is the best in the literature is obtained as 97.3\% among the four sets of the experiments for each hand gestures. The recognition results are reported with a substantial number of experiments and labeling computation.

在这项研究中，我们引入了基于协作表示的基于分类的谱域中的新型变体和应用，以使用原始表面肌电图信号来识别手势。光谱特征的直观使用通过循环矩阵来解释。所提出的基于频谱协作表示的分类（SCRC）能够以相当丰富的手势集来更高准确度地识别手势。对于每个手势，在四组实验中获得最好的文献中最差的识别结果为97.3％。识别结果报告了大量的实验和标签计算。
