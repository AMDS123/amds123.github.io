##### Abstract
We study the problem of searching for and tracking a collection of moving targets using a robot with a limited Field-Of-View (FOV) sensor. The actual number of targets present in the environment is not known a priori. We propose a search and tracking framework based on the concept of Bayesian Random Finite Sets (RFSs). Specifically, we generalize the Gaussian Mixture Probability Hypothesis Density (GM-PHD) filter which was previously applied for tracking problems to allow for simultaneous search and tracking with a limited FOV sensor. The proposed framework can extract individual target tracks as well as estimate the number and the spatial density of targets. We also show how to use the Gaussian Process (GP) regression to extract and predict non-linear target trajectories in this framework. We demonstrate the efficacy of our techniques through representative simulations and a real data collected from an aerial robot.
