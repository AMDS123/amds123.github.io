##### Abstract
In the last two years, there have been numerous papers that have looked into using Deep Neural Networks to replace the acoustic model in traditional statistical parametric speech synthesis. However, far less attention has been paid to approaches like DNN-based postfiltering where DNNs work in conjunction with traditional acoustic models. In this paper, we investigate the use of Recurrent Neural Networks as a potential postfilter for synthesis. We explore the possibility of replacing existing postfilters, as well as highlight the ease with which arbitrary new features can be added as input to the postfilter. We also tried a novel approach of jointly training the Classification And Regression Tree and the postfilter, rather than the traditional approach of training them independently.

在过去的两年中，已经有大量的文章研究了用深度神经网络代替传统统计参数语音合成中的声学模型。然而，对DNN与传统声学模型结合使用的基于DNN的后置滤波等方法的关注却少得多。在本文中，我们研究使用递归神经网络作为合成的潜在后置滤波器。我们探索替换现有后置过滤器的可能性，以及强调随意添加新功能作为输入到后置过滤器的简易性。我们也尝试了一种联合训练分类回归树和后置过滤器的新方法，而不是传统的独立训练方法。
