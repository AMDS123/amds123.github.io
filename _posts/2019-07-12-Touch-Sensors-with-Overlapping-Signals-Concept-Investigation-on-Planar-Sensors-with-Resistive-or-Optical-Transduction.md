##### Abstract
Traditional methods for achieving high localization accuracy on tactile sensors usually involve a matrix of miniaturized individual sensors distributed on the area of interest. This approach usually comes at a price of increased complexity in fabrication and circuitry, and can be hard to adapt to non-planar geometries. We propose a method where sensing terminals are embedded in a volume of soft material. Mechanical strain in this material results in a measurable signal between any two given terminals. By having multiple terminals and pairing them against each other in all possible combinations, we obtain a rich signal set using few wires. We mine this data to learn the mapping between the signals we extract and the contact parameters of interest. Our approach is general enough that it can be applied with different transduction methods, and achieves high accuracy in identifying indentation location and depth. Moreover, this method lends itself to simple fabrication techniques and makes no assumption about the underlying geometry, potentially simplifying future integration in robot hands.
