##### Abstract
Deep learning techniques are being used in skeleton based action recognition tasks and outstanding performance has been reported. Compared with RNN based methods which tend to overemphasize temporal information, CNN-based approaches can jointly capture spatio-temporal information from texture color images encoded from skeleton sequences. There are several skeleton-based features that have proven effective in RNN-based and handcrafted-feature-based methods. However, it remains unknown whether they are suitable for CNN-based approaches. This paper proposes to encode five spatial skeleton features into images with different encoding methods. In addition, the performance implication of different joints used for feature extraction is studied. The proposed method achieved state-of-the-art performance on NTU RGB+D dataset for 3D human action analysis. An accuracy of 75.32\% was achieved in Large Scale 3D Human Activity Analysis Challenge in Depth Videos.

深度学习技术正被用于基于骨架的动作识别任务，并且已经有了出色的性能报告。与基于RNN的方法相比，过分强调时间信息，基于CNN的方法可以从骨架序列编码的纹理彩色图像中共同捕获时空信息。有几种基于骨架的功能在基于RNN和基于手工特征的方法中被证明是有效的。但是，它们是否适合基于CNN的方法尚不得而知。本文提出用不同的编码方法将五种空间骨架特征编码成图像。另外，研究了用于特征提取的不同关节的性能影响。所提出的方法在用于3D人体动作分析的NTU RGB + D数据集上实现了最先进的性能。深度视频中的大规模3D人类活动分析挑战达到了75.32％的准确性。
