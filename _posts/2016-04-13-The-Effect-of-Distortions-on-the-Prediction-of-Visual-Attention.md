##### Abstract
Existing saliency models have been designed and evaluated for predicting the saliency in distortion-free images. However, in practice, the image quality is affected by a host of factors at several stages of the image processing pipeline such as acquisition, compression and transmission. Several studies have explored the effect of distortion on human visual attention; however, none of them have considered the performance of visual saliency models in the presence of distortion. Furthermore, given that one potential application of visual saliency prediction is to aid pooling of objective visual quality metrics, it is important to compare the performance of existing saliency models on distorted images. In this paper, we evaluate several state-of-the-art visual attention models over different databases consisting of distorted images with various types of distortions such as blur, noise and compression with varying levels of distortion severity. This paper also introduces new improved performance evaluation metrics that are shown to overcome shortcomings in existing performance metrics. We find that the performance of most models improves with moderate and high levels of distortions as compared to the near distortion-free case. In addition, model performance is also found to decrease with an increase in image complexity.

已经设计并评估了现有的显着性模型，以预测无失真图像中的显着性。但在实际应用中，图像质量受到图像处理流水线几个阶段的诸多因素的影响，如采集，压缩，传输等。有几项研究探讨了畸变对人类视觉注意力的影响;然而，他们都没有考虑失真时视觉显着性模型的表现。此外，由于视觉显着性预测的一个潜在应用是帮助汇集客观视觉质量度量，所以重要的是比较现有显着性模型在失真图像上的性能。在本文中，我们评估了几个最先进的视觉注意模型在不同的数据库组成的失真图像与各种类型的失真，如模糊，噪声和不同程度的失真严重程度的压缩。本文还介绍了新的改进的性能评估指标，可以克服现有性能指标中的缺陷。我们发现，大多数模型的表现与中等和高水平的失真相比，几乎无失真的情况下提高。另外，模型性能也随着图像复杂度的增加而降低。
