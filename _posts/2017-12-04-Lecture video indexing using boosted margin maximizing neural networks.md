##### Abstract
This paper presents a novel approach for lecture video indexing using a boosted deep convolutional neural network system. The indexing is performed by matching high quality slide images, for which text is either known or extracted, to lower resolution video frames with possible noise, perspective distortion, and occlusions. We propose a deep neural network integrated with a boosting framework composed of two sub-networks targeting feature extraction and similarity determination to perform the matching. The trained network is given as input a pair of slide image and a candidate video frame image and produces the similarity between them. A boosting framework is integrated into our proposed network during the training process. Experimental results show that the proposed approach is much more capable of handling occlusion, spatial transformations, and other types of noises when compared with known approaches.

本文提出了一种新颖的讲座视频索引方法，使用增强型深度卷积神经网络系统。索引是通过将高质量的幻灯片图像（其文本是已知的或提取的）匹配到具有可能的噪声，透视失真和遮挡的较低分辨率的视频帧来执行的。我们提出了一个深度神经网络与增强框架结合，由两个子网络组成，目标是进行特征提取和相似性确定以进行匹配。经训练的网络被输入一对幻灯片图像和候选视频帧图像，并产生它们之间的相似性。在培训过程中，我们提出的网络中融入了一个促进框架。实验结果表明，与已知方法相比，所提出的方法更能够处理遮挡，空间变换和其他类型的噪声。
