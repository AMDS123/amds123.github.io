##### Abstract
In this paper we show that if we want to obtain human evidence about conventionalization of some phrases, we should ask native speakers about associations they have to a given phrase and its component words. We have shown that if component words of a phrase have each other as frequent associations, then this phrase can be considered as conventionalized. Another type of conventionalized phrases can be revealed using two factors: low entropy of phrase associations and low intersection of component word and phrase associations. The association experiments were performed for the Russian language.

##### Abstract (translated by Google)
在本文中，我们表明，如果我们想要获得有关某些短语的传统化的人类证据，我们应该问母语人士关于它们与特定短语及其组成单词的关联。我们已经表明，如果一个短语的成分词互为频繁的关联，那么这个短语可以被认为是传统化的。另一类传统化的短语可以使用两个因素来揭示：短语关联的低熵和成分词和短语关联的低交集。关联实验是针对俄语进行的。
