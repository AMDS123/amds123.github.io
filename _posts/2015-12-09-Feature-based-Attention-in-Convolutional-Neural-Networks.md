##### Abstract
Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have proven effective for image processing tasks, such as object recognition and classification. Recently, CNNs have been enhanced with concepts of attention, similar to those found in biology. Much of this work on attention has focused on effective serial spatial processing. In this paper, I introduce a simple procedure for applying feature-based attention (FBA) to CNNs and compare multiple implementation options. FBA is a top-down signal applied globally to an input image which aides in detecting chosen objects in cluttered or noisy settings. The concept of FBA and the implementation details tested here were derived from what is known (and debated) about biological object- and feature-based attention. The implementations of FBA described here increase performance on challenging object detection tasks using a procedure that is simple, fast, and does not require additional iterative training. Furthermore, the comparisons performed here suggest that a proposed model of biological FBA (the "feature similarity gain model") is effective in increasing performance.

卷积神经网络（CNN）已被证明对图像处理任务有效，如对象识别和分类。最近，CNN的注意力的概念得到了增强，类似于生物学中的那些。大部分关注的工作集中在有效的串行空间处理上。在本文中，我将介绍一个将基于特征的注意力（FBA）应用于CNN的简单过程，并比较多个实施选项。 FBA是一种全局应用于输入图像的自顶向下信号，它有助于在混乱或嘈杂的环境中检测所选对象。 FBA的概念和这里测试的实现细节是从已知的（和辩论的）关于基于生物目标和基于特征的注意力中推导出来的。这里描述的FBA的实现使用简单，快速并且不需要额外的迭代训练的过程来提高具有挑战性的对象检测任务的性能。此外，这里进行的比较表明，提出的生物FBA模型（“特征相似性增益模型”）在提高性能方面是有效的。
