##### Abstract
As semantically-enabled applications require high-quality ontologies, developing and maintaining as correct and complete as possible ontologies is an important, although difficult task in ontology engineering. A key step is ontology debugging and completion. In general, there are two steps: detecting defects and repairing defects. In this paper we formalize the repairing step as an abduction problem and situate the state of the art with respect to this framework. We show that there still are many open research problems and show opportunities for further work and advancing the field.
