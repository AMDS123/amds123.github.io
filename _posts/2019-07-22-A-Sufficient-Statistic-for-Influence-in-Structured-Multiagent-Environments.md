##### Abstract
Making decisions in complex environments is a key challenge in artificial intelligence (AI). Situations involving multiple decision makers are particularly complex, leading to computation intractability of principled solution methods. A body of work in AI [4, 3, 41, 45, 47, 2] has tried to mitigate this problem by trying to bring down interaction to its core: how does the policy of one agent influence another agent? If we can find more compact representations of such influence, this can help us deal with the complexity, for instance by searching the space of influences rather than that of policies [45]. However, so far these notions of influence have been restricted in their applicability to special cases of interaction. In this paper we formalize influence-based abstraction (IBA), which facilitates the elimination of latent state factors without any loss in value, for a very general class of problems described as factored partially observable stochastic games (fPOSGs) [33]. This generalizes existing descriptions of influence, and thus can serve as the foundation for improvements in scalability and other insights in decision making in complex settings.
