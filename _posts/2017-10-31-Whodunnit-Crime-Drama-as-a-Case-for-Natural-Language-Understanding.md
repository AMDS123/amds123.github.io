##### Abstract
In this paper we argue that crime drama exemplified in television programs such as CSI:Crime Scene Investigation is an ideal testbed for approximating real-world natural language understanding and the complex inferences associated with it. We propose to treat crime drama as a new inference task, capitalizing on the fact that each episode poses the same basic question (i.e., who committed the crime) and naturally provides the answer when the perpetrator is revealed. We develop a new dataset based on CSI episodes, formalize perpetrator identification as a sequence labeling problem, and develop an LSTM-based model which learns from multi-modal data. Experimental results show that an incremental inference strategy is key to making accurate guesses as well as learning from representations fusing textual, visual, and acoustic input.

在本文中，我们认为犯罪戏剧在CSI的电视节目中得到了体现：“犯罪现场调查”是近似真实世界的自然语言理解和与之相关的复杂推论的理想试验台。我们建议把犯罪戏剧作为一个新的推理任务，利用每个事件提出相同的基本问题（即犯罪者）这一事实，并在犯罪人被揭露时自然提供答案。我们开发了一个基于CSI事件的新数据集，将犯罪者身份确定为序列标签问题，并开发了一个从多模态数据中学习的基于LSTM的模型。实验结果表明，增量推理策略是准确猜测的关键，也是融合文本，视觉和声音输入的表征学习的关键。
