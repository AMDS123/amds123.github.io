##### Abstract
State-of-the-art models for semantic segmentation are based on adaptations of convolutional networks that had originally been designed for image classification. However, dense prediction and image classification are structurally different. In this work, we develop a new convolutional network module that is specifically designed for dense prediction. The presented module uses dilated convolutions to systematically aggregate multi-scale contextual information without losing resolution. The architecture is based on the fact that dilated convolutions support exponential expansion of the receptive field without loss of resolution or coverage. We show that the presented context module increases the accuracy of state-of-the-art semantic segmentation systems. In addition, we examine the adaptation of image classification networks to dense prediction and show that simplifying the adapted network can increase accuracy.

最先进的语义分割模型基于最初为图像分类而设计的卷积网络的改编。然而，密集预测和图像分类在结构上是不同的。在这项工作中，我们开发了一个专门为密集预测而设计的新的卷积网络模块。所呈现的模块使用扩张卷积来系统地聚合多尺度上下文信息而不会失去分辨率。该体系结构基于这样一个事实，即扩张的卷积支持感受域的指数扩展，而不会损失分辨率或覆盖范围。我们表明，提出的上下文模块提高了最先进的语义分割系统的准确性。此外，我们研究图像分类网络适应密集预测，并表明简化适应网络可以提高准确性。
