##### Abstract
3D image reconstruction from a set of X-ray projections is an important image reconstruction problem, with applications in medical imaging, industrial inspection and airport security. The innovation of X-ray emitter arrays allows for a novel type of X-ray scanners with multiple simultaneously emitting sources. However, two or more sources emitting at the same time can yield measurements from overlapping rays, imposing a new type of image reconstruction problem based on nonlinear constraints. Using traditional linear reconstruction methods, respective scanner geometries have to be implemented such that no rays overlap, which severely restricts the scanner design. We derive a new type of 3D image reconstruction model with nonlinear constraints, based on measurements with overlapping X-rays. Further, we show that the arising optimization problem is partially convex, and present an algorithm to solve it. Experiments show highly improved image reconstruction results from both simulated and real-world measurements.

从一组X射线投影三维图像重建是一个重要的图像重建问题，在医学成像，工业检测和机场安全的应用。 X射线发射器阵列的创新使得可以使用具有多个同时发射源的新型X射线扫描器。然而，同时发射的两个或更多个源可以产生来自重叠射线的测量，施加基于非线性约束的新型图像重建问题。使用传统的线性重建方法，必须实现相应的扫描仪几何形状，使得没有光线重叠，严重限制了扫描仪的设计。基于重叠X射线的测量结果，我们推出了一种新型的带有非线性约束的三维图像重建模型。进一步，我们证明了所产生的优化问题是部分凸的，并提出了一个算法来解决它。实验显示，来自模拟和现实世界测量的图像重建结果高度改进。
