##### Abstract
This paper was motivated by the problem of how to make robots fuse and transfer their experience so that they can effectively use prior knowledge and quickly adapt to new environments. To address the problem, we present a learning architecture for navigation in cloud robotic systems: Lifelong Federated Reinforcement Learning (LFRLA). In the work, We propose a knowledge fusion algorithm for upgrading a shared model deployed on the cloud. Then, effective transfer learning methods in LFRLA are introduced. LFRLA is consistent with human cognitive science and fits well in cloud robotic systems. Experiments show that LFRLA greatly improves the efficiency of reinforcement learning for robot navigation. The cloud robotic system deployment also shows that LFRLA is capable of fusing prior knowledge. In addition, we release a cloud robotic navigation-learning website based on LFRLA.
