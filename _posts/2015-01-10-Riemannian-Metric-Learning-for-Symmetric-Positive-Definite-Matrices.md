##### Abstract
Over the past few years, symmetric positive definite (SPD) matrices have been receiving considerable attention from computer vision community. Though various distance measures have been proposed in the past for comparing SPD matrices, the two most widely-used measures are affine-invariant distance and log-Euclidean distance. This is because these two measures are true geodesic distances induced by Riemannian geometry. In this work, we focus on the log-Euclidean Riemannian geometry and propose a data-driven approach for learning Riemannian metrics/geodesic distances for SPD matrices. We show that the geodesic distance learned using the proposed approach performs better than various existing distance measures when evaluated on face matching and clustering tasks.

近几年来，对称正定矩阵一直受到计算机视觉界的广泛关注。虽然过去提出了各种距离测量方法来比较SPD矩阵，但两种最广泛使用的测量方法是仿射不变距离和对数欧几里德距离。这是因为这两个测量是由黎曼几何引起的真正的测地距离。在这项工作中，我们关注对数欧几里德黎曼几何，并提出一个数据驱动的方法来学习黎曼度量/​​测地距离的SPD矩阵。我们表明，使用所提出的方法学习的测地距离在对面部匹配和聚类任务进行评估时比各种现有的距离测量执行得更好。
