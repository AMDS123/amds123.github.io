##### Abstract
Automatic image annotation is among the fundamental problems in computer vision and pattern recognition, and it is becoming increasingly important in order to develop algorithms that are able to search and browse large-scale image collections. In this paper, we propose a label propagation framework based on Kernel Canonical Correlation Analysis (KCCA), which builds a latent semantic space where correlation of visual and textual features are well preserved into a semantic embedding. The proposed approach is robust and can work either when the training set is well annotated by experts, as well as when it is noisy such as in the case of user-generated tags in social media. We report extensive results on four popular datasets. Our results show that our KCCA-based framework can be applied to several state-of-the-art label transfer methods to obtain significant improvements. Our approach works even with the noisy tags of social users, provided that appropriate denoising is performed. Experiments on a large scale setting show that our method can provide some benefits even when the semantic space is estimated on a subset of training images.

自动图像标注是计算机视觉和模式识别的基本问题之一，为了开发能够搜索和浏览大规模图像集的算法变得越来越重要。在本文中，我们提出了一个基于核正则相关分析（KCCA）的标签传播框架，构建了一个潜在的语义空间，将视觉和文本特征的相关性保存到一个语义嵌入中。所提出的方法是稳健的，并且可以在训练集由专家很好地注释以及在诸如在社交媒体中用户生成的标签的情况下有噪声的情况下工作。我们报告了四个流行数据集的广泛结果。我们的研究结果表明，我们基于KCCA的框架可以应用于多种最先进的标签转移方法，以获得显着的改进。如果进行适当的去噪，我们的方法即使在社交用户的嘈杂标签下也能正常工作。大规模设置的实验表明，即使在训练图像的子集上估计语义空间，我们的方法也可以提供一些好处。
