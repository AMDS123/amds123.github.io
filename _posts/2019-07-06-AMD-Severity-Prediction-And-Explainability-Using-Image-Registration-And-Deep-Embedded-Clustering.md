##### Abstract
We propose a method to predict severity of age related macular degeneration (AMD) from input optical coherence tomography (OCT) images. Although there is no standard clinical severity scale for AMD, we leverage deep learning (DL) based image registration and clustering methods to identify diseased cases and predict their severity. Experiments demonstrate our approach's disease classification performance matches state of the art methods. The predicted disease severity performs well on previously unseen data. Registration output provides better explainability than class activation maps regarding label and severity decisions
