##### Abstract
In this paper, a biologically-inspired adaptive intelligent secondary controller is developed for microgrids to tackle system dynamics uncertainties, faults, and/or disturbances. The developed adaptive biologically-inspired controller adopts a novel computational model of emotional learning in mammalian limbic system. The learning capability of the proposed biologically-inspired intelligent controller makes it a promising approach to deal with the power system non-linear and volatile dynamics without increasing the controller complexity, and maintain the voltage and frequency stabilities by using an efficient reference tracking mechanism. The performance of the proposed intelligent secondary controller is validated in terms of the voltage and frequency absolute errors in the simulated microgrid. Simulation results highlight the efficiency and robustness of the proposed intelligent controller under the fault conditions and different system uncertainties compared to other benchmark controllers.
