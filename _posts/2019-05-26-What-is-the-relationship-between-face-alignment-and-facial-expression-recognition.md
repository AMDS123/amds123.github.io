##### Abstract
Face expression recognition is still a complex task, particularly due to the presence of head pose variations. Although face alignment approaches are becoming increasingly accurate for characterizing facial regions, it is important to consider the impact of these approaches when they are used for other related tasks such as head pose registration or facial expression recognition. In this paper, we compare the performance of recent face alignment approaches to highlight the most appropriate techniques for preserving facial geometry when correcting the head pose variation. Also, we highlight the most suitable techniques that locate facial landmarks in the presence of head pose variations and facial expressions.
