##### Abstract
Taking an image of an object is at its core a lossy process. The rich information about the three-dimensional structure of the world is flattened to an image plane and decisions such as viewpoint and camera parameters are final and not easily revertible. As a consequence, possibilities of changing viewpoint are limited. Given a single image depicting an object, novel-view synthesis is the task of generating new images that render the object from a different viewpoint than the one given. The main difficulty is to synthesize the parts that are disoccluded; disocclusion occurs when parts of an object are hidden by the object itself under a specific viewpoint. In this work, we show how to improve novel-view synthesis by making use of the correlations observed in 3D models and applying them to new image instances. We propose a technique to use the structural information extracted from a 3D model that matches the image object in terms of viewpoint and shape. For the latter part, we propose an efficient 2D-to-3D alignment method that associates precisely the image appearance with the 3D model geometry with minimal user interaction. Our technique is able to simulate plausible viewpoint changes for a variety of object classes within seconds. Additionally, we show that our synthesized images can be used as additional training data that improves the performance of standard object detectors.

拍摄物体的图像的核心是一个有损耗的过程。关于世界三维结构的丰富信息被平化为一个图像平面，而诸如视点和摄像机参数的决定是最终的并且不容易恢复的。结果，改变观点的可能性是有限的。给定描绘对象的单个图像，新视点合成是产生新的图像的任务，该图像从与给定的视点不同的视点呈现对象。主要困难是综合分离的部分;当某个对象的某些部分被某个特定视点下的对象所隐藏时，就会发生不连贯现象。在这项工作中，我们展示了如何通过利用在三维模型中观察到的相关性并将其应用于新的图像实例来改善新视角合成。我们提出了一种技术，使用从视点和形状方面匹配图像对象的3D模型中提取的结构信息。对于后一部分，我们提出了一种高效的二维到三维对齐方法，该方法将图像外观与三维模型几何图形进行精确关联，而用户交互量最小。我们的技术能够在几秒内模拟各种对象类别的合理视点变化。此外，我们显示我们的合成图像可以作为额外的训练数据，提高标准物体检测器的性能。
