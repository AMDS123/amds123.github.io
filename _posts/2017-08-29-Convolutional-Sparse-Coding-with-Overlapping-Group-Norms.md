##### Abstract
The most widely used form of convolutional sparse coding uses an $\ell_1$ regularization term. While this approach has been successful in a variety of applications, a limitation of the $\ell_1$ penalty is that it is homogeneous across the spatial and filter index dimensions of the sparse representation array, so that sparsity cannot be separately controlled across these dimensions. The present paper considers the consequences of replacing the $\ell_1$ penalty with a mixed group norm, motivated by recent theoretical results for convolutional sparse representations. Algorithms are developed for solving the resulting problems, which are quite challenging, and the impact on the performance of the denoising problem is evaluated. The mixed group norms are found to perform very poorly in this application. While their performance is greatly improved by introducing a weighting strategy, such a strategy also improves the performance obtained from the much simpler and computationally cheaper $\ell_1$ norm.

卷积稀疏编码中使用最广泛的形式是使用$ \ ell_1 $正则化项。虽然这种方法在各种应用中都取得了成功，但是$ \ ell_1 $惩罚的局限性在于它在稀疏表示阵列的空间和过滤器索引维度上是均匀的，所以在这些维度上不能单独控制稀疏度。本文考虑了用最近的卷积稀疏表示的理论结果激发的混合组规范替换$ \ ell_1 $惩罚的后果。开发了算法来解决这个相当具有挑战性的问题，并且评估了对去噪问题的性能的影响。混合组规范在这个应用程序中表现很差。通过引入权重策略，他们的性能得到了很大的改善，但是这种策略也提高了从更简单和计算上更便宜的$ \ n \ n范数所获得的性能。
