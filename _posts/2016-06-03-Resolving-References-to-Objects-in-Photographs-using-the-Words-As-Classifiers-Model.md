##### Abstract
A common use of language is to refer to visually present objects. Modelling it in computers requires modelling the link between language and perception. The "words as classifiers" model of grounded semantics views words as classifiers of perceptual contexts, and composes the meaning of a phrase through composition of the denotations of its component words. It was recently shown to perform well in a game-playing scenario with a small number of object types. We apply it to two large sets of real-world photographs that contain a much larger variety of types and for which referring expressions are available. Using a pre-trained convolutional neural network to extract image features, and augmenting these with in-picture positional information, we show that the model achieves performance competitive with the state of the art in a reference resolution task (given expression, find bounding box of its referent), while, as we argue, being conceptually simpler and more flexible.

##### Abstract (translated by Google)
语言的一种常见用法是指视觉上呈现的物体。在计算机中建模需要对语言和感知之间的联系进行建模。基于语义的“词作为分类器”模型将词作为感知上下文的分类器，通过组合词的指称组成词组的意义。最近表现出在少数对象类型的游戏场景中表现良好。我们将其应用于包含更多类型的两个大型实际照片，并且可以使用引用表达式。使用预先训练的卷积神经网络来提取图像特征，并用图像内位置信息来增强这些特征，我们证明该模型在参考分辨率任务中实现了与现有技术水平相竞争的性能（给定表达式，找到边界框它的指称），而我们认为，在概念上更简单，更灵活。
