##### Abstract
In astronomy multiple images are frequently obtained at the same position of the sky for follow-up co-addition as it helps one go deeper and look for fainter objects. With large scale panchromatic synoptic surveys becoming more common, image co-addition has become even more necessary as new observations start to get compared with co-added fiducial sky in real time. The standard co-addition techniques have included straight averages, variance weighted averages, medians etc. A more sophisticated nonlinear response chi-square method is also used when it is known that the data are background noise limited and the point spread function is homogenized in all channels. A more robust object detection technique capable of detecting faint sources, even those not seen at all epochs which will normally be smoothed out in traditional methods, is described. The analysis at each pixel level is based on a formula similar to Mahalanobis distance. The method does not depend on the point spread function.

在天文学中，多个图像经常在天空的相同位置获得，用于后续的共同添加，因为它帮助人们更深入地寻找暗淡的物体。随着大规模的全色天气测量变得越来越普遍，随着新的观测开始与实时共同添加的基准天空相比，图像共添加变得更加必要。标准共添加技术包括直线平均值，方差加权平均值，中位数等。当已知数据是背景噪声限制且点扩散函数均匀化时，还使用更复杂的非线性响应卡方法通道。描述了一个更强大的对象检测技术，能够检测微弱的信号源，即使是在传统方法中通常会被平滑掉的所有时期看不到的信号源。每个像素级的分析基于与马氏距离相似的公式。该方法不依赖于点扩散函数。
