##### Abstract
The key in agglomerative clustering is to define the affinity measure between two sets. A novel agglomerative clustering method is proposed by utilizing the path integral to define the affinity measure. Firstly, the path integral descriptor of an edge, a node and a set is computed by path integral and exponent generating function. Then, the affinity measure between two sets is obtained by path integral descriptor of sets. Several good properties of the path integral descriptor is proposed in this paper. In addition, we give the physical interpretation of the proposed path integral descriptor of a set. The proposed path integral descriptor of a set can be regard as the collectiveness measure of a set, which can be a moving system such as human crowd, sheep herd and so on. Self-driven particle (SDP) model is used to test the ability of the proposed method in measuring collectiveness.

聚集聚类的关键是定义两个集合之间的亲和性度量。提出了一种新的凝聚聚类方法，利用路径积分来定义亲和性度量。首先，通过路径积分和指数生成函数计算边，节点和集合的路径积分描述符。然后，通过集合的路径积分描述符获得两个集合之间的亲和性度量。本文提出了路径积分描述子的几个很好的性质。此外，我们给出了一组集合的路径积分描述符的物理解释。所提出的路径积分描述符可以看成是一个集合的集合度量，它可以是人群，羊群等移动系统。自驱动粒子（SDP）模型被用来测试所提出的方法在测量集体性方面的能力。
