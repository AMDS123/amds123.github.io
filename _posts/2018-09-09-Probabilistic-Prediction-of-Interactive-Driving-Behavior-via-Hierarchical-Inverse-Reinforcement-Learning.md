##### Abstract
Autonomous vehicles (AVs) are on the road. To safely and efficiently interact with other road participants, AVs have to accurately predict the behavior of surrounding vehicles and plan accordingly. Such prediction should be probabilistic, to address the uncertainties in human behavior. Such prediction should also be interactive, since the distribution over all possible trajectories of the predicted vehicle depends not only on historical information, but also on future plans of other vehicles that interact with it. To achieve such interaction-aware predictions, we propose a probabilistic prediction approach based on hierarchical inverse reinforcement learning (IRL). First, we explicitly consider the hierarchical trajectory-generation process of human drivers involving both discrete and continuous driving decisions. Based on this, the distribution over all future trajectories of the predicted vehicle is formulated as a mixture of distributions partitioned by the discrete decisions. Then we apply IRL hierarchically to learn the distributions from real human demonstrations. A case study for the ramp-merging driving scenario is provided. The quantitative results show that the proposed approach can accurately predict both the discrete driving decisions such as yield or pass as well as the continuous trajectories.

自动驾驶汽车（AVs）正在路上。为了安全有效地与其他道路参与者进行交互，AV必须准确地预测周围车辆的行为并相应地进行规划。这种预测应该是概率性的，以解决人类行为的不确定性。这种预测也应该是交互式的，因为预测车辆的所有可能轨迹的分布不仅取决于历史信息，而且还取决于与其交互的其他车辆的未来计划。为了实现这种交互感知预测，我们提出了一种基于分层逆强化学习（IRL）的概率预测方法。首先，我们明确地考虑了涉及离散和连续驾驶决策的人类驾驶员的分层轨迹生成过程。基于此，预测车辆的所有未来轨迹的分布被公式化为由离散决策划分的分布的混合。然后我们按层次应用IRL来学习真实人类演示的分布。提供了斜坡合并驾驶场景的案例研究。定量结果表明，该方法可以准确预测离散驾驶决策，如屈服或通过，以及连续轨迹。
