##### Abstract
Generative models that learn to associate variations in the output along isolated attributes with coordinate directions in latent space are said to possess disentangled representations. This has been a recent topic of great interest, but remains poorly understood. We show that even for GANs that do not possess disentangled representations, one can find paths in latent space over which local disentanglement occurs. These paths are determined by the leading right-singular vectors of the Jacobian of the generator with respect to its input. We describe an efficient regularizer that aligns these vectors with the coordinate axes, and show that it can be used to induce high-quality, disentangled representations in GANs, in a completely unsupervised manner.
