##### Abstract
The technological advancement and sophistication in cameras and gadgets prompt researchers to have focus on image analysis and text understanding. The deep learning techniques demonstrated well to assess the potential for classifying text from natural scene images as reported in recent years. There are variety of deep learning approaches that prospects the detection and recognition of text, effectively from images. In this work, we presented Arabic scene text recognition using Convolutional Neural Networks (ConvNets) as a deep learning classifier. As the scene text data is slanted and skewed, thus to deal with maximum variations, we employ five orientations with respect to single occurrence of a character. The training is formulated by keeping filter size 3 x 3 and 5 x 5 with stride value as 1 and 2. During text classification phase, we trained network with distinct learning rates. Our approach reported encouraging results on recognition of Arabic characters from segmented Arabic scene images.

相机和小工具的技术进步和复杂性促使研究人员将重点放在图像分析和文本理解上。深度学习技术很好地展现了近年来报道的自然景象图像分类潜力。有各种深度学习方法，从图像有效地展示文本的检测和识别。在这项工作中，我们提出了使用卷积神经网络（ConvNets）作为深度学习分类器的阿拉伯文场景文本识别。由于场景文本数据是倾斜的，因此为了处理最大的变化，我们针对单个字符的出现采用五个方向。训练是通过保持滤波器大小为3 x 3和5 x 5，步长值为1和2来进行的。在文本分类阶段，我们训练了具有不同学习速率的网络。我们的方法报告了阿拉伯文字符分段图像识别的令人鼓舞的结果。
