##### Abstract
Many real-world domains can be expressed as graphs and, more generally, as multi-relational knowledge graphs. Though reasoning and learning with knowledge graphs has traditionally been addressed by symbolic approaches, recent methods in (deep) representation learning has shown promising results for specialized tasks such as knowledge base completion. These approaches abandon the traditional symbolic paradigm by replacing symbols with vectors in Euclidean space. With few exceptions, symbolic and distributional approaches are explored in different communities and little is known about their respective strengths and weaknesses. In this work, we compare representation learning and relational learning on various relational classification and clustering tasks and analyse the complexity of the rules used implicitly by these approaches. Preliminary results reveal possible indicators that could help in choosing one approach over the other for particular knowledge graphs.

##### Abstract (translated by Google)
许多现实世界的领域可以表示为图表，更一般地，可以表示为多关系知识图。虽然用知识图推理和学习传统上是用符号方法来解决的，但最近的（深层）表示学习方法已经显示出对专门任务（如知识库完成）的有希望的结果。这些方法通过用欧几里德空间中的矢量替换符号来放弃传统的符号范式。除少数例外，不同社区对符号和分配方法进行了探索，对其各自的优缺点知之甚少。在这项工作中，我们比较了关于各种关系分类和聚类任务的表示学习和关系学习，并分析了这些方法隐含使用的规则的复杂性。初步结果揭示了可能的指标，可能有助于为特定的知识图选择另一种方法。
