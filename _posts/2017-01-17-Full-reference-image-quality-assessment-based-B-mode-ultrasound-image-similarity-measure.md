##### Abstract
During the last decades, the number of new full-reference image quality assessment algorithms has been increasing drastically. Yet, despite of the remarkable progress that has been made, the medical ultrasound image similarity measurement remains largely unsolved due to a high level of speckle noise contamination. Potential applications of the ultrasound image similarity measurement seem evident in several aspects. To name a few, ultrasound imaging quality assessment, abnormal function region detection, etc. In this paper, a comparative study was made on full-reference image quality assessment methods for ultrasound image visual structural similarity measure. Moreover, based on the image similarity index, a generic ultrasound motion tracking re-initialization framework is given in this work. The experiments are conducted on synthetic data and real-ultrasound liver data and the results demonstrate that, with proposed similarity-based tracking re-initialization, the mean error of landmarks tracking can be decreased from 2 mm to about 1.5 mm in the ultrasound liver sequence.

在过去的几十年中，新的全参考图像质量评估算法的数量急剧增加。然而，尽管已经取得了显着的进步，但是由于高水平的散斑噪声污染，医学超声图像相似性测量仍然大部分未解决。超声图像相似性测量的潜在应用在几个方面看起来明显。仅举几例，超声成像质量评估，功能区域异常检测等。本文对超声图像视觉结构相似性测量的全参考图像质量评估方法进行了比较研究。此外，基于图像相似性指标，本文给出了一种通用的超声运动跟踪重新初始化框架。实验是在合成数据和实时超声肝脏数据上进行的，结果表明，在提出的基于相似性的跟踪重新初始化的情况下，在超声波肝脏序列中，地标跟踪的平均误差可以从2mm降低到约1.5mm 。
