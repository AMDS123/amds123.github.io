##### Abstract
Subjective and objective experiments are conducted to understand the extent to which a speaker's gender influences the acoustics of unvoiced (U) sounds. U segments of utterances are replaced by the corresponding segments of a speaker of opposite gender to prepare modified utterances. Humans are asked to judge if the modified utterance is spoken by one or two speakers. The experiments show that human subjects are unable to distinguish the modified from the original. Thus, listeners are able to identify the U segments irrespective of the gender, which may be based on some speaker-independent invariant acoustic cues. To test if this finding is purely a perceptual phenomenon, objective experiments are also conducted. Gender specific HMM based phoneme recognition systems are trained using the TIMIT training set and tested on (a) utterances spoken by the same gender (b) utterances spoken by the opposite gender and (c) the modified utterances of the test set. As expected, the performance is the highest for case (a) and the lowest for case (b). The performance degrades only slightly for case (c). This result shows that the speaker's gender does not as strongly influence the acoustics of U sounds as they do the voiced sounds.

##### Abstract (translated by Google)
进行主观和客观实验以了解说话者的性别影响清音（U）声音的声学的程度。 U段话语被相反性别的说话者的相应片段替换以准备修改的话语。要求人们判断一个或两个发言者是否说过修改过的话语。实验表明，人类受试者无法区分修改与原始。因此，听众能够识别U片段而不考虑性别，这可以基于一些与说话者无关的不变声学提示。为了测试这一发现是否纯粹是一种感知现象，还进行了客观实验。使用TIMIT训练集训练基于性别特定HMM的音素识别系统，并在（a）由相同性别说出的话语（b）由异性说出的话语和（c）测试集的修改的话语上进行测试。正如预期的那样，案例（a）的表现最高，案例（b）的表现最低。对于情况（c），性能仅略微降低。这个结果表明，扬声器的性别并没有像发出浊音那样强烈地影响U声的声学效果。
