##### Abstract
Event generation for the LHC can be supplemented by generative adversarial networks, which simply clone events and avoid highly inefficient event unweighting. For top pair production we show how such a network describes intermediate on-shell particles, phase space boundaries, and tails of distributions. It can be extended in a straightforward manner to include for instance off-shell contributions, higher orders, or approximate detector effects.
