##### Abstract
We propose a novel tree classification system called Treelogy, that fuses deep representations with hand-crafted features obtained from leaf images to perform leaf-based plant classification. Key to this system are segmentation of the leaf from an untextured background, using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for learning deep representations, extracting hand-crafted features with a number of image processing techniques, training a linear SVM with feature vectors, merging SVM and CNN results, and identifying the species from a dataset of 57 trees. Our classification results show that fusion of deep representations with hand-crafted features leads to the highest accuracy. The proposed algorithm is embedded in a smart-phone application, which is publicly available. Furthermore, our novel dataset comprised of 5408 leaf images is also made public for use of other researchers.

我们提出了一种称为Treelogy的新型树分类系统，该系统将从叶图像获得的手工特征融合深度表示以执行基于叶的植物分类。这个系统的关键是从无纹理背景分割叶子，使用卷积神经网络（CNNs）学习深度表示，用一些图像处理技术提取手工特征，用特征向量训练线性SVM，合并SVM和CNN结果，并从57棵树的数据集中识别物种。我们的分类结果表明，深度表示与手工制作的特征的融合导致了最高的准确性。所提出的算法被嵌入到公众可用的智能电话应用中。此外，我们的新颖数据集由5408个叶子图像组成，也被公开供其他研究人员使用。
