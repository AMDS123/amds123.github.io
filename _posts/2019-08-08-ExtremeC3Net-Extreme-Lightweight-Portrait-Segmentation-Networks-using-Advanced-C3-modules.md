##### Abstract
Designing a lightweight and robust portrait segmentation algorithm is an important task for a wide range of face applications. However, the problem has been considered as a subset of the object segmentation problem. Obviously, portrait segmentation has its unique requirements. First, because the portrait segmentation is performed in the middle of a whole process of many real-world applications, it requires extremely lightweight models. Second, there has not been any public datasets in this domain that contain a sufficient number of images with unbiased statistics. To solve the problems, we introduce a new extremely lightweight portrait segmentation model consisting of a two-branched architecture based on the concentrated-comprehensive convolutions block. Our method reduces the number of parameters from 2.08M to 37.9K (around 98.2% reduction), while maintaining the accuracy within a 1% margin from the state-of-the-art portrait segmentation method. In our qualitative and quantitative analysis on the EG1800 dataset, we show that our method outperforms various existing lightweight segmentation models. Second, we propose a simple method to create additional portrait segmentation data which can improve accuracy on the EG1800 dataset. Also, we analyze the bias in public datasets by additionally annotating race, gender, and age on our own. The augmented dataset and the additional annotations will be released after the publication.
