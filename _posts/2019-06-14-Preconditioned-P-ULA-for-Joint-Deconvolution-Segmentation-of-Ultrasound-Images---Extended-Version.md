##### Abstract
Joint deconvolution and segmentation of ultrasound images is a challenging problem in medical imaging. By adopting a hierarchical Bayesian model, we propose an accelerated Markov chain Monte Carlo scheme where the tissue reflectivity function is sampled thanks to a recently introduced proximal unadjusted Langevin algorithm. This new approach is combined with a forward-backward step and a preconditioning strategy to accelerate the convergence, and with a method based on the majorization-minimization principle to solve the inner nonconvex minimization problems. As demonstrated in numerical experiments conducted on both simulated and in vivo ultrasound images, the proposed method provides high-quality restoration and segmentation results and is up to six times faster than an existing Hamiltonian Monte Carlo method.
