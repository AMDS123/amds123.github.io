##### Abstract
Generating informative responses in end-to-end neural dialogue systems attracts a lot of attention in recent years. Various previous work leverages external knowledge and the dialogue contexts to generate such responses. Nevertheless, few has demonstrated their capability on incorporating the appropriate knowledge in response generation. Motivated by this, we propose a novel open-domain conversation generation model in this paper, which employs the posterior knowledge distribution to guide knowledge selection, therefore generating more appropriate and informative responses in conversations. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first one who utilize the posterior knowledge distribution to facilitate conversation generation. Our experiments on both automatic and human evaluation clearly verify the superior performance of our model over the state-of-the-art baselines.
