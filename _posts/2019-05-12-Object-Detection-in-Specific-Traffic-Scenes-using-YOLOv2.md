##### Abstract
object detection framework plays crucial role in autonomous driving. In this paper, we introduce the real-time object detection framework called You Only Look Once (YOLOv1) and the related improvements of YOLOv2. We further explore the capability of YOLOv2 by implementing its pre-trained model to do the object detecting tasks in some specific traffic scenes. The four artificially designed traffic scenes include single-car, single-person, frontperson-rearcar and frontcar-rearperson.
