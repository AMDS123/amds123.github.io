##### Abstract
This document describes the machine translation system used in the submissions of IIIT-Hyderabad CVIT-MT for the WAT-2018 English-Hindi translation task. Performance is evaluated on the associated corpus provided by the organizers. We experimented with convolutional sequence to sequence architectures. We also train with additional data obtained through backtranslation.
