##### Abstract
We classify .NET files as either benign or malicious by examining certain directed graphs extracted from the files via decompilation. Each graph is viewed probabilistically as a Markov chain where each node heuristically represents the possible state of the running file, and by computing the PageRank vector (Perron vector with transport) we can assign a probability measure over the nodes of the given graph. We train a random forest with features derived from computing Lebesgue antiderivatives of functions defined over the vertex sets of the graphs listed above against the PageRank measure. The model was trained on 2.5 million samples of .NET and has an accuracy of 98.3\% on test data. The median time needed for decompilation and scoring was 24ms.
