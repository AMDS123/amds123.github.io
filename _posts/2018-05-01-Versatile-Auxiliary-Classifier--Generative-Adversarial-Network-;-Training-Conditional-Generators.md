##### Abstract
One of the most interesting challenges in Artificial Intelligence is to train conditional generators which are able to provide labeled fake samples drawn from a specific distribution. In this work, a new framework is presented to train a deep conditional generator by placing a classifier in parallel with the discriminator and back propagate the classification error through the generator network. The method is versatile and is applicable to any variations of Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) implementation, and also is giving superior results compare to similar methods.

人工智能中最有趣的挑战之一是训练能够提供从特定分布中抽取的标记假样本的条件发生器。在这项工作中，提出了一种新的框架，通过将分类器与鉴别器并行放置，并通过生成器网络传播分类错误来训练深层条件生成器。该方法是多功能的，适用于生成敌对网络（GAN）实现的任何变体，并且与类似方法相比，也提供了优异的结果。
