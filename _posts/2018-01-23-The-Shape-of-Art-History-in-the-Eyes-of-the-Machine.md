##### Abstract
How does the machine classify styles in art? And how does it relate to art historians's methods for analyzing style? Several studies have shown the ability of the machine to learn and predict style categories, such as Renaissance, Baroque, Impressionism, etc., from images of paintings. This implies that the machine can learn an internal representation encoding discriminative features through its visual analysis. However, such a representation is not necessarily interpretable. We conducted a comprehensive study of several of the state-of-the-art convolutional neural networks applied to the task of style classification on 77K images of paintings, and analyzed the learned representation through correlation analysis with concepts derived from art history. Surprisingly, the networks could place the works of art in a smooth temporal arrangement mainly based on learning style labels, without any a priori knowledge of time of creation, the historical time and context of styles, or relations between styles. The learned representations showed that there are few underlying factors that explain the visual variations of style in art. Some of these factors were found to correlate with style patterns suggested by Heinrich W\"olfflin (1846-1945). The learned representations also consistently highlighted certain artists as the extreme distinctive representative of their styles, which quantitatively confirms art historian observations.

机器如何分类艺术风格？它与艺术史学家的风格分析方法有何关系？有几项研究表明，机器能够从绘画的图像中学习和预测文艺复兴时期，巴洛克风格，印象主义等风格类别。这意味着机器可以通过视觉分析学习内部表示编码的区分特征。但是，这样的表示不一定是可解释的。我们对几种最先进的卷积神经网络进行了综合研究，应用于77K图像风格分类的任务，并通过相关分析和艺术史的概念进行相关性分析。令人惊讶的是，网络可以把艺术作品放在一个主要基于学习风格标签的平滑时间安排中，而不需要对创作时间的先验知识，风格的历史时间和环境，或者风格之间的关系。学习的表现表明，很少有潜在的因素可以解释艺术风格的视觉变化。这些因素中的一些被发现与海因里希·W·奥尔夫林（1846-1945）提出的风格模式有关，学者的表现也一直强调某些艺术家是他们风格的极端独特的代表，这从数量上证实了艺术史学家的观察。
