##### Abstract
As the expressive depth of an emotional face differs with individuals or expressions, recognizing an expression using a single facial image at a moment is difficult. A relative expression of a query face compared to a reference face might alleviate this difficulty. In this paper, we propose to utilize contrastive representation that embeds a distinctive expressive factor for a discriminative purpose. The contrastive representation is calculated at the embedding layer of deep networks by comparing a given (query) image with the reference image. We attempt to utilize a generative reference image that is estimated based on the given image. Consequently, we deploy deep neural networks that embed a combination of a generative model, a contrastive model, and a discriminative model with an end-to-end training manner. In our proposed networks, we attempt to disentangle a facial expressive factor in two steps including learning of a generator network and a contrastive encoder network. We conducted extensive experiments on publicly available face expression databases (CK+, MMI, Oulu-CASIA, and in-the-wild databases) that have been widely adopted in the recent literatures. The proposed method outperforms the known state-of-the art methods in terms of the recognition accuracy.
