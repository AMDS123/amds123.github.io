##### Abstract
Authentication of individuals via palmprint based biometric system is becoming very popular due to its reliability as it contains unique and stable features. In this paper, we present a novel approach for palmprint recognition and its representation. To extract the palm lines, local thresholding technique Niblack binarization algorithm is adopted. The endpoints of these lines are determined and a connection is created among them using the Delaunay triangulation thereby generating a distinct topological structure of each palmprint. Next, we extract different geometric as well as quantitative features from the triangles of the Delaunay triangulation that assist in identifying different individuals. To ensure that the proposed approach is invariant to rotation and scaling, features were made relative to topological and geometrical structure of the palmprint. The similarity of the two palmprints is computed using the weighted sum approach and compared with the k-nearest neighbor. The experimental results obtained reflect the effectiveness of the proposed approach to discriminate between different palmprint images and thus achieved a recognition rate of 90% over large databases.

通过基于掌纹的生物识别系统对个人进行身份验证由于其可靠性而变得非常流行，因为它包含独特和稳定的特征。在本文中，我们提出了一种新颖的掌纹识别方法及其表示方法。为了提取掌纹，采用局部阈值技术Niblack二值化算法。这些线的端点被确定，并且使用Delaunay三角测量在它们之间建立连接，由此产生每个掌纹的独特的拓扑结构。接下来，我们从Delaunay三角剖分的三角形中提取不同的几何以及定量特征，以帮助识别不同的个体。为了确保所提出的方法对于旋转和缩放是不变的，相对于掌纹的拓扑和几何结构做出了特征。使用加权求和方法计算两个掌纹的相似度，并与k近邻进行比较。所获得的实验结果反映了所提出的方法在区分不同的掌纹图像方面的有效性，并因此在大型数据库上实现了90％的识别率。
