##### Abstract
In this paper, we propose a nonlinear dimensionality reduction algorithm for the manifold of Symmetric Positive Definite (SPD) matrices that considers the geometry of SPD matrices and provides a low dimensional representation of the manifold with high class discrimination. The proposed algorithm, tries to preserve the local structure of the data by preserving distance to local mean (DPLM) and also provides an implicit projection matrix. DPLM is linear in terms of the number of training samples and may use the label information when they are available in order to performance improvement in classification tasks. We performed several experiments on the multi-class dataset IIa from BCI competition IV. The results show that our approach as dimensionality reduction technique - leads to superior results in comparison with other competitor in the related literature because of its robustness against outliers. The experiments confirm that the combination of DPLM with FGMDM as the classifier leads to the state of the art performance on this dataset.

在本文中，我们提出了一种考虑SPD矩阵的几何结构的对称正定（SPD）矩阵的流形的非线性降维算法，并提供了具有高级辨别的流形的低维表示。该算法通过保留到局部均值的距离（DPLM）来保持数据的局部结构，并提供隐式投影矩阵。 DPLM在训练样本的数量方面是线性的，并且在可用时可以使用标签信息以改善分类任务的性能。我们对来自BCI竞赛IV的多级数据集IIa进行了几个实验。结果表明，我们的方法作为降维技术 - 由于其对于异常值的鲁棒性，与相关文献中的其他竞争者相比导致优越的结果。实验证实，DPLM与FGMDM的组合作为分类器导致了该数据集的最新性能状态。
