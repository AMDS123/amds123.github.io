##### Abstract
In this paper, we provide an improved version of UnDEMoN model for depth and ego motion estimation from monocular images. The improvement is achieved by combining the standard bi-linear sampler with a deep network based image sampling model (DIS-NET) to provide better image reconstruction capabilities on which the depth estimation accuracy depends in un-supervised learning models. While DIS-NET provides higher order regression and larger input search space, the bi-linear sampler provides geometric constraints necessary for reducing the size of the solution space for an ill-posed problem of this kind. This combination is shown to provide significant improvement in depth and pose estimation accuracy outperforming all existing state-of-the-art methods in this category. In addition, the modified network uses far less number of tunable parameters making it one of the lightest deep network model for depth estimation. The proposed model is labeled as "UnDEMoN 2.0" indicating an improvement over the existing UnDEMoN model. The efficacy of the proposed model is demonstrated through rigorous experimental analysis on the standard KITTI dataset.
