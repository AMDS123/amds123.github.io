##### Abstract
Learning options that allow agents to exhibit temporally higher order behavior has proven to be useful in increasing exploration, reducing sample complexity and for various transfer scenarios. Deep Discovery of Options (DDO) is a generative algorithm that learns a hierarchical policy along with options directly from expert trajectories. We perform a qualitative and quantitative analysis of options inferred from DDO in different domains. To this end, we suggest different value metrics like option termination condition, hinge value function error and KL-Divergence based distance metric to compare different methods. Analyzing the termination condition of the options and number of time steps the options were run revealed that the options were terminating prematurely. We suggest modifications which can be incorporated easily and alleviates the problem of shorter options and a collapse of options to the same mode.
