##### Abstract
Deep neural networks have lately shown tremendous performance in various applications including vision and speech processing tasks. However, alongside their ability to perform these tasks with such high accuracy, it has been shown that they are highly susceptible to adversarial attacks: a small change of the input would cause the network to err with high confidence. This phenomenon exposes an inherent fault in these networks and their ability to generalize well. For this reason, providing robustness to adversarial attacks is an important challenge in networks training, which has led to an extensive research. In this work, we suggest a theoretically inspired novel approach to improve the networks' robustness. Our method applies regularization using the Frobenius norm of the Jacobian of the network, which is applied as post-processing, after regular training has finished. We demonstrate empirically that it leads to enhanced robustness results with a minimal change in the original network's accuracy.

深度神经网络最近在包括视觉和语音处理任务的各种应用中显示出巨大的性能。然而，除了能够以如此高的精度执行这些任务之外，已经表明它们非常容易受到对抗性攻击：输入的小改变会导致网络以高信度犯错。这种现象暴露了这些网络的固有缺陷以及它们普遍化的能力。出于这个原因，为对抗攻击提供稳健性是网络训练中的一个重要挑战，这导致了广泛的研究。在这项工作中，我们建议从理论上启发新颖的方法来改善网络的稳健性。我们的方法使用网络雅可比行列式的Frobenius范数进行正则化，在定期训练结束后，将其用作后处理。我们凭经验证明，它会导致增强鲁棒性结果，并使原始网络的精度发生微小变化。
