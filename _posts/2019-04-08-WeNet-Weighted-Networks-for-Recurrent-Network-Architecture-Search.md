##### Abstract
In recent years, there has been increasing demand for automatic architecture search in deep learning. Numerous approaches have been proposed and led to state-of-the-art results in various applications, including image classification and language modeling. In this paper, we propose a novel way of architecture search by means of weighted networks (WeNet), which consist of a number of networks, with each assigned a weight. These weights are updated with back-propagation to reflect the importance of different networks. Such weighted networks bear similarity to mixture of experts. We conduct experiments on Penn Treebank and WikiText-2. We show that the proposed WeNet can find recurrent architectures which result in state-of-the-art performance.
