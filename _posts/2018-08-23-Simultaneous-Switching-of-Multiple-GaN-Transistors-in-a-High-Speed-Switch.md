##### Abstract
A broadband travelling wave kicker operating with 80 MHz repetition rates is required for the new PIP-II accelerator at Fermilab. We present a technique to drive simultaneously four series-connected enhancement mode GaN-on-silicon power transistors by means of microwave photonics techniques. These four transistors are arranged into a high voltage and high repetition rate switch. Using multiple transistors in series is required to share switching losses. Using a photonic signal distribution system is required to achieve precise synchronization between transistors. We demonstrate 600 V arbitrary pulse generation into a 200 Ohm load with 2 ns rise/fall time. The arbitrary pulse widths can be adjusted from 4 ns to essentially DC.
