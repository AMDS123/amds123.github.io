##### Abstract
Word similarity computation is a widely recognized task in the field of lexical semantics. Most proposed tasks test on similarity of word pairs of single morpheme, while few works focus on words of two morphemes or more morphemes. In this work, we propose COS960, a benchmark dataset with 960 pairs of Chinese wOrd Similarity, where all the words have two morphemes in three Part of Speech (POS) tags with their human annotated similarity rather than relatedness. We give a detailed description of dataset construction and annotation process, and test on a range of word embedding models. The dataset of this paper can be obtained from https://github.com/thunlp/COS960.
