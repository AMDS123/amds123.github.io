##### Abstract
Shape analyses of tephra grains result in understanding eruption mechanism of volcanoes. However, we have to define and select parameter set such as convexity for the precise discrimination of tephra grains. Selection of the best parameter set for the recognition of tephra shapes is complicated. Actually, many shape parameters have been suggested. Recently, neural network has made a great success in the field of machine learning. Convolutional neural network can recognize the shape of images without human bias and shape parameters. We applied the simple convolutional neural network developed for the handwritten digits to the recognition of tephra shapes. The network was trained by Morphologi tephra images, and it can recognize the tephra shapes with approximately 90% of accuracy.

火山灰颗粒的形态分析可以了解火山的爆发机理。然而，我们必须定义和选择参数集，例如用于精确区分五角星的凸度。选择用于识别鹿角形状的最佳参数集是复杂的。实际上，已经提出了许多形状参数。最近，神经网络在机器学习领域取得了巨大的成功。卷积神经网络能够识别图像的形状，而无需人为偏差和形状参数。我们将用于手写数字开发的简单卷积神经网络应用于对形状的识别。网络由Morphologi tephra图像训练，可以识别大约90％的准确性。
