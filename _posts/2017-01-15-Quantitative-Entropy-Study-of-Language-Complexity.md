##### Abstract
We study the entropy of Chinese and English texts, based on characters in case of Chinese texts and based on words for both languages. Significant differences are found between the languages and between different personal styles of debating partners. The entropy analysis points in the direction of lower entropy, that is of higher complexity. Such a text analysis would be applied for individuals of different styles, a single individual at different age, as well as different groups of the population.

##### Abstract (translated by Google)
我们研究中文和英文文本的熵，基于中文文本的字符和基于两种语言的文字。语言之间和辩论伙伴的不同个人风格之间存在显着差异。熵分析指向熵越低的方向，越复杂。这样的文本分析将适用于不同风格的个体，不同年龄段的单个人以及不同群体的人群。
