##### Abstract
While Points Of Interest (POIs), such as restaurants, hotels, and barber shops, are part of urban areas irrespective of their specific locations, the names of these POIs often reveal valuable information related to local culture, landmarks, influential families, figures, events, and so on. Place names have long been studied by geographers, e.g., to understand their origins and relations to family names. However, there is a lack of large-scale empirical studies that examine the localness of place names and their changes with geographic distance. In addition to enhancing our understanding of the coherence of geographic regions, such empirical studies are also significant for geographic information retrieval where they can inform computational models and improve the accuracy of place name disambiguation. In this work, we conduct an empirical study based on 112,071 POIs in seven US metropolitan areas extracted from an open Yelp dataset. We propose to adopt term frequency and inverse document frequency in geographic contexts to identify local terms used in POI names and to analyze their usages across different POI types. Our results show an uneven usage of local terms across POI types, which is highly consistent among different geographic regions. We also examine the decaying effect of POI name similarity with the increase of distance among POIs. While our analysis focuses on urban POI names, the presented methods can be generalized to other place types as well, such as mountain peaks and streets.

虽然兴趣点（POI）（例如餐馆，酒店和理发店）是城市地区的一部分，不论其具体位置如何，但这些POI的名称通常会显示与本地文化，地标，有影响力的家庭，数字，事件等等。地名学家一直在研究地名，例如了解它们的起源和与姓氏的关系。然而，缺乏大规模的实证研究来检验地名的地方性及其与地理距离的变化。除了提高我们对地理区域一致性的理解之外，此类实证研究对于地理信息检索也很重要，因为它们可以通知计算模型并提高地名消歧的准确性。在这项工作中，我们根据从开放的Yelp数据集中提取的7个美国大都市地区的112,071个POI进行实证研究。我们建议在地理环境中采用词频和逆文档频率来识别POI名称中使用的本地词语并分析它们在不同POI类型中的使用情况。我们的研究结果显示，不同地理区域之间高度一致的所有POI类型的本地条款使用率不均衡。我们还研究了POI名称相似性的衰减效应与POI之间距离的增加。虽然我们的分析侧重于城市POI名称，但所提出的方法也可以推广到其他地方类型，例如山峰和街道。
