##### Abstract
Darwiche and Pearl's seminal 1997 article outlined a number of baseline principles for a logic of iterated belief revision. These principles, the DP postulates, have been supplemented in a number of alternative ways. Most of the suggestions made have resulted in a form of `reductionism' that identifies belief states with orderings of worlds. However, this position has recently been criticised as being unacceptably strong. Other proposals, such as the popular principle (P), aka `Independence', characteristic of `admissible' revision operators, remain commendably more modest. In this paper, we supplement both the DP postulates and (P) with a number of novel conditions. While the DP postulates constrain the relation between a prior and a posterior conditional belief set, our new principles notably govern the relation between two posterior conditional belief sets obtained from a common prior by different revisions. We show that operators from the resulting family, which subsumes both lexicographic and restrained revision, can be represented as relating belief states that are associated with a `proper ordinal interval' (POI) assignment, a structure more fine-grained than a simple ordering of worlds. We close the paper by noting that these operators satisfy iterated versions of a large number of AGM era postulates, including Superexpansion, that are not sound for admissible operators in general.

Darwiche和Pearl的1997年开创性文章概述了迭代信念修正逻辑的一些基本原则。 DP假设这些原则已经通过多种替代方式得到补充。所提出的大多数建议都产生了一种“还原论”形式，它通过世界秩序来识别信仰状态。然而，这一立场最近被批评为不可接受的强烈。其他提议，例如流行原则（P），又称“独立”，“可接受的”修订运营商的特征，仍然值得称赞。在本文中，我们补充了DP假设和（P）以及许多新的条件。虽然DP假设约束先前和后验条件信念集之间的关系，但我们的新原则显着地控制了从不同修订版本的共同先验获得的两个后验条件信念集之间的关系。我们证明了包含词典和限制修订的结果族的运算符可以表示为与“适当序数区间”（POI）赋值相关的相关信念状态，这种结构比简单排序更精细。世界。我们通过注意到这些运算符满足大量AGM时代假设的迭代版本（包括Superexpansion）来结束本文，这些假设对于一般的可接受运算符来说是不合理的。
