##### Abstract
The scattering of light observed through the turbid underwater channel is often regarded as the leading challenge when designing underwater electro-optical imaging systems. There have been many approaches to address the effects of scattering such as using pulsed laser sources to reject scattered light temporally, or using intensity modulated waveforms and matched filters to remove the scattered light spectrally. In this paper, a new method is proposed which primarily uses the backscattering asymmetry property for object detection and geometric profiling. In our approach, two parallel and identical continuous wave (CW) laser beams with narrow beam widths (~2mm) are used as active illumination sources. The two beams also have controllable spacing and aiming angle, as well as initial phase difference for convenience of scanning and profiling a target. Through theory and experimental results, it will be shown that when an object leans or tilts towards one of the beam's central trajectory, the asymmetry in the backscattered signals can be used to indicate the location or slope of the target's surface, respectively. By varying the spacing or aiming angle of the two beams, a number of surface samples can be collected to reconstruct the object's shape geometrically. The resolution and range limit of our approach are also measured and reported in this work. In application, our proposed method provides an economic solution to perform imaging through turbid underwater environments. Additionally, the idea can be combined with the pulsed or modulated laser signals for enhanced imaging results.

在设计水下电光成像系统时，通过浑浊水下通道观察到的光散射通常被认为是主要挑战。已经有许多方法来解决散射的影响，例如使用脉冲激光源暂时抑制散射光，或使用强度调制波形和匹配滤波器来在光谱上去除散射光。在本文中，提出了一种新的方法，主要利用后向散射不对称性来进行物体检测和几何轮廓分析。在我们的方法中，使用两束平行且相同的连续波（CW）激光束作为主动照明光源，光束宽度较窄（〜2mm）。这两个光束还具有可控的间距和瞄准角度，以及初始相位差以便于扫描和分析目标。通过理论和实验结果，可以看出，当一个物体倾斜或倾斜到一个光束的中心轨迹时，背散射信号的不对称性可以分别用来指示目标表面的位置或斜率。通过改变两个光束的间隔或瞄准角度，可以收集多个表面样本以几何重建物体的形状。我们的方法的分辨率和范围限制也在这项工作中进行测量和报告。在应用中，我们提出的方法提供了一种经济的解决方案，可通过混浊的水下环境进行成像。另外，该想法可以与脉冲或调制激光信号相结合，以增强成像结果。
