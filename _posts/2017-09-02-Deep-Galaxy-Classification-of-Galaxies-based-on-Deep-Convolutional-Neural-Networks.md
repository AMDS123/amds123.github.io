##### Abstract
In this paper, a deep convolutional neural network architecture for galaxies classification is presented. The galaxy can be classified based on its features into main three categories Elliptical, Spiral, and Irregular. The proposed deep galaxies architecture consists of 8 layers, one main convolutional layer for features extraction with 96 filters, followed by two principles fully connected layers for classification. It is trained over 1356 images and achieved 97.272% in testing accuracy. A comparative result is made and the testing accuracy was compared with other related works. The proposed architecture outperformed other related works in terms of testing accuracy.

本文提出了一个深度卷积神经网络的星系分类结构。星系可以根据其特征分为椭圆型，螺旋型和不规则型三大类。提议的深星系结构由8层组成，一个主要卷积层用于96个过滤器的特征提取，然后是两个原理完全连接的层用于分类。经过1356个图像训练，测试精度达到97.272％。比较结果和测试的准确性与其他相关工作进行了比较。提出的架构在测试精度方面胜过其他相关工作。
