##### Abstract
A low-power Content-Addressable-Memory (CAM) is introduced employing a new mechanism for associativity between the input tags and the corresponding address of the output data. The proposed architecture is based on a recently developed clustered-sparse-network using binary-weighted connections that on-average will eliminate most of the parallel comparisons performed during a search. Therefore, the dynamic energy consumption of the proposed design is significantly lower compared to that of a conventional low-power CAM design. Given an input tag, the proposed architecture computes a few possibilities for the location of the matched tag and performs the comparisons on them to locate a single valid match. A 0.13 um CMOS technology was used for simulation purposes. The energy consumption and the search delay of the proposed design are 9.5%, and 30.4% of that of the conventional NAND architecture respectively with a 3.4% higher number of transistors.

引入低功率内容寻址存储器（CAM），其采用新的输入标签与输出数据的相应地址之间的关联机制。所提出的架构基于最近开发的使用二进制加权连接的集群稀疏网络，平均将消除在搜索期间执行的大部分并行比较。因此，与传统的低功率CAM设计相比，所提出的设计的动态能量消耗显着较低。给定一个输入标签，所提出的体系结构计算匹配标签的位置的一些可能性，并对它们进行比较来定位单个有效匹配。一个0.13微米的CMOS技术被用于模拟目的。所提出的设计的能耗和搜索延迟分别是常规NAND架构的9.5％和30.4％，晶体管数量增加了3.4％。
