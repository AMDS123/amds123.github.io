##### Abstract
Compute and memory demands of state-of-the-art deep learning methods are still a shortcoming that must be addressed to make them useful at IoT end-nodes. In particular, recent results depict a hopeful prospect for image processing using Convolutional Neural Netwoks, CNNs, but the gap between software and hardware implementations is already considerable for IoT and mobile edge computing applications due to their high power consumption. This proposal performs low-power and real time deep learning-based multiple object visual tracking implemented on an NVIDIA Jetson TX2 development kit. It includes a camera and wireless connection capability and it is battery powered for mobile and outdoor applications. A collection of representative sequences captured with the on-board camera, dETRUSC video dataset, is used to exemplify the performance of the proposed algorithm and to facilitate benchmarking. The results in terms of power consumption and frame rate demonstrate the feasibility of deep learning algorithms on embedded platforms although more effort to joint algorithm and hardware design of CNNs is needed.

最先进的深度学习方法的计算和存储器需求仍然是必须解决的缺点，以使它们在物联网终端节点上有用。特别是，最近的结果描绘了使用卷积神经网络（CNN）进行图像处理的有希望的前景，但由于其高功耗，软件和硬件实现之间的差距对于物联网和移动边缘计算应用已经相当大。该提议在NVIDIA Jetson TX2开发套件上执行基于低功耗和实时深度学习的多目标视觉跟踪。它包括摄像头和无线连接功能，并为移动和户外应用提供电池供电。使用机载相机dETRUSC视频数据集捕获的代表性序列的集合用于举例说明所提出的算法的性能并且便于基准测试。在功耗和帧速率方面的结果证明了深度学习算法在嵌入式平台上的可行性，尽管需要更多努力来联合CNN的算法和硬件设计。
