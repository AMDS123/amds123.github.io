##### Abstract
We took part in the YouTube-8M Video Understanding Challenge hosted on Kaggle, and achieved the 10th place within less than one month's time. In this paper, we present an extensive analysis and solution to the underlying machine-learning problem based on frame-level data, where major challenges are identified and corresponding preliminary methods are proposed. It's noteworthy that, with merely the proposed strategies and uniformly-averaging multi-crop ensemble was it sufficient for us to reach our ranking. We also report the methods we believe to be promising but didn't have enough time to train to convergence. We hope this paper could serve, to some extent, as a review and guideline of the YouTube-8M multi-label video classification benchmark, inspiring future attempts and research.

我们参加了在Kaggle举办的YouTube-8M视频理解挑战赛，并在不到一个月的时间内取得了第十名。在本文中，我们提出了基于框架级数据的底层机器学习问题的广泛分析和解决方案，其中主要挑战被确定并且提出了相应的初步方法。值得注意的是，只有提出的策略和统一平均多作物集合，我们才能达到我们的排名。我们也报告了我们认为有前途的方法，但没有足够的时间来进行融合。我们希望本文在某种程度上可以作为YouTube-8M多标签视频分类基准的回顾和指导，激励未来的尝试和研究。
