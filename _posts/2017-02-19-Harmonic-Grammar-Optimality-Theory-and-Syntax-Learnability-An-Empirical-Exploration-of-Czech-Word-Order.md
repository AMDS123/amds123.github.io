##### Abstract
This work presents a systematic theoretical and empirical comparison of the major algorithms that have been proposed for learning Harmonic and Optimality Theory grammars (HG and OT, respectively). By comparing learning algorithms, we are also able to compare the closely related OT and HG frameworks themselves. Experimental results show that the additional expressivity of the HG framework over OT affords performance gains in the task of predicting the surface word order of Czech sentences. We compare the perceptron with the classic Gradual Learning Algorithm (GLA), which learns OT grammars, as well as the popular Maximum Entropy model. In addition to showing that the perceptron is theoretically appealing, our work shows that the performance of the HG model it learns approaches that of the upper bound in prediction accuracy on a held out test set and that it is capable of accurately modeling observed variation.

这项工作提出了一个系统的理论和经验比较的主要算法已经提出了学习谐波和最优性理论语法（HG和OT分别）。通过比较学习算法，我们也可以比较紧密相关的OT和HG框架本身。实验结果表明，HG框架超越OT的附加表现性在预测捷克语句子的表面词序方面提供了性能上的提升。我们将感知器与经典的逐步学习算法（GLA）进行比较，该算法学习OT语法以及流行的最大熵模型。除了表明感知器在理论上是有吸引力的，我们的工作表明，它所学习的HG模型的性能方法是在一个支持的测试集上预测精度的上限，并且它能够精确地模拟观察到的变化。
