##### Abstract
We present a semi-automated system for sizing nasal Positive Airway Pressure (PAP) masks based upon a neural network model that was trained with facial photographs of both PAP mask users and non-users. It demonstrated an accuracy of 72% in correctly sizing a mask and 96% accuracy sizing to within 1 mask size group. The semi-automated system performed comparably to sizing from manual measurements taken from the same images which produced 89% and 100% accuracy respectively.

我们提出了一个基于神经网络模型，用PAP面具用户和非用户面部照片进行训练，确定鼻腔正压通气（PAP）面罩的半自动系统。它证明了正确定型掩模的精确度为72％，在1个掩模尺寸组内的精确度为96％。半自动化系统与从分别产生89％和100％准确度的相同图像中手动测量的尺寸相当。
