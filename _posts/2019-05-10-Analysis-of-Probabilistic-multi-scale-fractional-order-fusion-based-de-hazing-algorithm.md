##### Abstract
In this report, a de-hazing algorithm based on probability and multi-scale fractional order-based fusion is proposed. The proposed scheme improves on a previously implemented multiscale fraction order-based fusion by augmenting its local contrast and edge sharpening features. It also brightens de-hazed images, while avoiding sky region over-enhancement. The results of the proposed algorithm are analyzed and compared with existing methods from the literature and indicate better performance in most cases.
