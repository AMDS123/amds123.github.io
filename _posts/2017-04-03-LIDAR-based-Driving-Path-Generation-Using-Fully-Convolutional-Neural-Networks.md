##### Abstract
In this work, a novel learning-based approach has been developed to generate driving paths by integrating LIDAR point clouds, GPS-IMU information, and Google driving directions. The system is based on a fully convolutional neural network that jointly learns to carry out perception and path generation from real-world driving sequences and that is trained using automatically generated training examples. Several combinations of input data were tested in order to assess the performance gain provided by specific information modalities. The fully convolutional neural network trained using all the available sensors together with driving directions achieved the best MaxF score of 88.13% when considering a region of interest of 60x60 meters. By considering a smaller region of interest, the agreement between predicted paths and ground-truth increased to 92.60%. The positive results obtained in this work indicate that the proposed system may help fill the gap between low-level scene parsing and behavior-reflex approaches by generating outputs that are close to vehicle control and at the same time human-interpretable.

在这项工作中，开发了一种新颖的基于学习的方法，通过集成LIDAR点云，GPS-IMU信息和Google驾驶路线来产生驾驶路径。该系统基于全卷积神经网络，共同学习从现实世界的驾驶序列中进行感知和路径生成，并且使用自动生成的训练示例进行训练。输入数据的几种组合进行了测试，以评估由特定信息模式提供的性能增益。当考虑60x60米的感兴趣区域时，使用所有可用传感器训练的完全卷积神经网络与行驶方向一起达到最佳MaxF得分88.13％。通过考虑一个较小的兴趣区域，预测路径和地面事实之间的协议增加到92.60％。在这项工作中取得的积极成果表明，拟议的系统可能有助于填补低级别场景解析和行为反射方法之间的差距，通过产生接近车辆控制的输出，同时人类可解释。
