##### Abstract
The current standard of intra-operative navigation during Fenestrated Endovascular Aortic Repair (FEVAR) calls for need of 3D alignments between inserted devices and aortic branches. The navigation commonly via 2D fluoroscopic images, lacks anatomical information, resulting in longer operation hours and radiation exposure. In this paper, a framework for real-time 3D robotic path planning from a single 2D fluoroscopic image of Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm (AAA) is introduced. A graph matching method is proposed to establish the correspondence between the 3D preoperative and 2D intra-operative AAA skeletons, and then the two skeletons are registered by skeleton deformation and regularization in respect to skeleton length and smoothness. Furthermore, deep learning was used to segment 3D pre-operative AAA from Computed Tomography (CT) scans to facilitate the framework automation. Simulation, phantom and patient AAA data sets have been used to validate the proposed framework. 3D distance error of 2mm was achieved in the phantom setup. Performance advantages were also achieved in terms of accuracy, robustness and time-efficiency. All the code will be open source.

目前在有孔血管内主动脉修复（FEVAR）期间的术中导航标准要求插入装置和主动脉分支之间需要3D对准。通常通过2D荧光透视图像导航，缺乏解剖信息，导致更长的手术时间和辐射暴露。在本文中，介绍了从腹主动脉瘤（AAA）的单个2D透视图像进行实时3D机器人路径规划的框架。提出了一种图形匹配方法，用于建立3D术前与2D术中AAA骨骼之间的对应关系，然后通过骨架变形和正则化对骨架长度和平滑度进行记录。此外，深度学习被用于从计算机断层扫描（CT）扫描中分割3D术前AAA，以促进框架自动化。模拟，幻像和患者AAA数据集已用于验证所提出的框架。在体模设置中实现了2mm的3D距离误差。在准确性，稳健性和时间效率方面也实现了性能优势。所有代码都是开源的。
