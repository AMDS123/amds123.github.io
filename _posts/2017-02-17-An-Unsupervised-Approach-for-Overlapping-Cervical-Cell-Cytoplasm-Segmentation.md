##### Abstract
The poor contrast and the overlapping of cervical cell cytoplasm are the major issues in the accurate segmentation of cervical cell cytoplasm. This paper presents an automated unsupervised cytoplasm segmentation approach which can effectively find the cytoplasm boundaries in overlapping cells. The proposed approach first segments the cell clumps from the cervical smear image and detects the nuclei in each cell clump. A modified Otsu method with prior class probability is proposed for accurate segmentation of nuclei from the cell clumps. Using distance regularized level set evolution, the contour around each nucleus is evolved until it reaches the cytoplasm boundaries. Promising results were obtained by experimenting on ISBI 2015 challenge dataset.

宫颈细胞浆细胞质对比度差和重叠是宫颈细胞浆细胞分类准确的主要问题。本文提出了一种自动化的无监督细胞质分割方法，可以有效地找到重叠细胞中的细胞质边界。所提出的方法首先从宫颈涂片图像分割细胞团并检测每个细胞团中的细胞核。提出了一种改进的具有先验概率的Otsu方法对细胞核细胞核的准确分割。使用距离正则化水平集演化，围绕每个核的轮廓演变直到它到达细胞质边界。通过在ISBI 2015挑战数据集上进行实验获得了有希望的结果。
