##### Abstract
We study Label-Smoothing as a means for improving adversarial robustness of supervised deep-learning models. After establishing a thorough and unified framework, we propose several novel Label-Smoothing methods: adversarial, Boltzmann and second-best Label-Smoothing methods. On various datasets (MNIST, CIFAR10, SVHN) and models (linear models, MLPs, LeNet, ResNet), we show that these methods improve adversarial robustness against a variety of attacks (FGSM, BIM, DeepFool, Carlini-Wagner) by better taking account of the dataset geometry. These proposed Label-Smoothing methods have two main advantages: they can be implemented as a modified cross-entropy loss, thus do not require any modifications of the network architecture nor do they lead to increased training times, and they improve both standard and adversarial accuracy.
