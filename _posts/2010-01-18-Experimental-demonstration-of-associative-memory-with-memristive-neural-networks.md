##### Abstract
When someone mentions the name of a known person we immediately recall her face and possibly many other traits. This is because we possess the so-called associative memory, that is the ability to correlate different memories to the same fact or event. Associative memory is such a fundamental and encompassing human ability (and not just human) that the network of neurons in our brain must perform it quite easily. The question is then whether electronic neural networks (electronic schemes that act somewhat similarly to human brains) can be built to perform this type of function. Although the field of neural networks has developed for many years, a key element, namely the synapses between adjacent neurons, has been lacking a satisfactory electronic representation. The reason for this is that a passive circuit element able to reproduce the synapse behaviour needs to remember its past dynamical history, store a continuous set of states, and be "plastic" according to the pre-synaptic and post-synaptic neuronal activity. Here we show that all this can be accomplished by a memory-resistor (memristor for short). In particular, by using simple and inexpensive off-the-shelf components we have built a memristor emulator which realizes all required synaptic properties. Most importantly, we have demonstrated experimentally the formation of associative memory in a simple neural network consisting of three electronic neurons connected by two memristor-emulator synapses. This experimental demonstration opens up new possibilities in the understanding of neural processes using memory devices, an important step forward to reproduce complex learning, adaptive and spontaneous behaviour with electronic neural networks.

当有人提到一个已知的人的名字时，我们立即回想起她的脸和其他许多特征。这是因为我们拥有所谓的联想记忆，就是将不同的记忆联系到同一事实或事件的能力。联想记忆是这样一个基本和包容的人类能力（而不仅仅是人类），我们大脑中的神经元网络必须很容易地执行它。那么问题是，是否可以建立电子神经网络（类似于人类大脑的电子方案）来执行这种类型的功能。虽然神经网络领域已经发展了很多年，但是一个关键因素，即相邻神经元之间的突触，缺乏令人满意的电子表示。其原因是能够重现突触行为的无源电路元件需要记住其过去的动态历史，存储一组连续的状态，并且根据突触前和突触后神经元活动是“塑性的”。在这里我们表明，所有这些都可以通过一个记忆电阻（忆阻器）来实现。特别是，通过使用简单且便宜的现成组件，我们构建了一个忆阻器模拟器，可以实现所有所需的突触特性。最重要的是，我们已经通过实验证明了一个简单的神经网络中由三个由两个忆阻器 - 仿真器突触连接的电子神经元组成的联想记忆。这个实验演示为理解使用记忆装置的神经过程开辟了新的可能性，这是利用电子神经网络重现复杂学习，自适应和自发行为的重要步骤。
