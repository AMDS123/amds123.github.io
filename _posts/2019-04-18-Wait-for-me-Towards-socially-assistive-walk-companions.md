##### Abstract
The aim of the present study involves designing a humanoid robot guide as a walking trainer for elderly and rehabilitation patients. The system is based on the humanoid robot Pepper with a compliance approach that allows to match the motion intention of the user to the robot's pace. This feasibility study is backed up by an experimental evaluation conducted in a rehabilitation centre. We hypothesize that Pepper robot used as an assistive partner, can also benefit elderly users by motivating them to perform physical activity.
