##### Abstract
We present an algorithm to search for the faint spectrum of a second star mixed with the spectrum of a brighter star in high resolution spectra. We model optical stellar spectra as the sum of two input spectra drawn from a vast library of stars throughout the H-R diagram. From typical spectra having resolution of R=60,000, we are able to detect companions as faint as 1% relative to the primary star in approximately the V and R bandpasses of photometry. We are also able to find evidence for triple and quadruple systems, given that any additional companions are sufficiently bright. The precise threshold percentage depends on the SNR of the spectrum and the properties of the two stars. For cases of non-detection, we place a limit on the brightness of any potential companions. This algorithm is useful for detecting both faint orbiting companions and background stars that are angularly close to a foreground target star. The size of the entrance slit to the spectrometer, 0.87 x 3 arcsec (typically), sets the angular domain within which the second star can be detected. We analyzed Keck-HIRES spectra of 1160 California Kepler Survey objects of interest (KOI) searching for the secondary spectra, with the two goals of alerting the community to two possible host stars of the transiting planet and to dilution of the light curve. We report 63 California Kepler Survey objects of interest showing spectroscopic evidence of a secondary star.

我们提出了一种算法来搜索高分辨率光谱中与明亮星的光谱混合的第二颗恒星的微弱光谱。我们将光学恒星光谱模型化为两个输入光谱的总和，从整个H-R图中的大量恒星库中得出。从具有R = 60,000分辨率的典型光谱中，我们能够在大约在测光的V和R带通中检测伴星，相对于主恒星为1％。我们还能够找到三重和四重系统的证据，因为任何额外的同伴都足够明亮。精确的阈值百分比取决于频谱的SNR和两颗恒星的性质。对于未检测到的情况，我们对任何潜在的同伴的亮度进行限制。这个算法对探测角度上接近前景目标恒星的微弱轨道同伴和背景恒星是有用的。通向光谱仪的入口狭缝的大小为0.87 x 3（典型值），设置了第二颗恒星可以被检测到的角度范围。我们分析了1160个加利福尼亚州开普勒勘测兴趣物体（KOI）的Keck-HIRES光谱搜索次级光谱，其中两个目标是提醒社区两个可能的过境行星的主星和稀释光线曲线。我们报告了63个加利福尼亚开普勒调查对象，显示次星的光谱证据。
