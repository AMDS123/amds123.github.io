##### Abstract
With the development of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) in recent years, the network structure has become more and more complex and varied, and has achieved very good results in pattern recognition, image classification, object detection and tracking. For CNNs used for image classification, in addition to the network structure, more and more research is now focusing on the improvement of the loss function, so as to enlarge the inter-class feature differences, and reduce the intra-class feature variations as soon as possible. Besides the traditional Softmax, typical loss functions include L-Softmax, AM-Softmax, ArcFace, and Center loss, etc. Based on the concept of predefined evenly-distributed class centroids (PEDCC) in CSAE network, this paper proposes a PEDCC-based loss function called PEDCC-Loss, which can make the inter-class distance maximal and intra-class distance small enough in hidden feature space. Multiple experiments on image classification and face recognition have proved that our method achieve the best recognition accuracy, and network training is stable and easy to converge.
