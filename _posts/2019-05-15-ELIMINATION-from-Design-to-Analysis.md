##### Abstract
Elimination is a word puzzle game for browsers and mobile devices, where all levels are generated by a constrained evolutionary algorithm with no human intervention. This paper describes the design of the game and its level generation methods, and analysis of playtraces from almost a thousand users who played the game since its release. The analysis corroborates that the level generator creates a sawtooth-shaped difficulty curve, as intended. The analysis also offers insights into player behavior in this game.
