##### Abstract
Predicting facial attributes from faces in the wild is very challenging due to pose and lighting variations in the real world. The key to this problem is to build proper feature representations to cope with these unfavourable conditions. Given the success of Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) in image classification, the high-level CNN feature, as an intuitive and reasonable choice, has been widely utilized for this problem. In this paper, however, we consider the mid-level CNN features as an alternative to the high-level ones for attribute prediction. This is based on the observation that face attributes are different: some of them are locally oriented while others are globally defined. Our investigations reveal that the mid-level deep representations outperform the prediction accuracy achieved by the (fine-tuned) high-level abstractions. We empirically demonstrate that the midlevel representations achieve state-of-the-art prediction performance on CelebA and LFWA datasets. Our investigations also show that by utilizing the mid-level representations one can employ a single deep network to achieve both face recognition and attribute prediction.

由于现实世界中的姿态和光照变化，从野外的面部预测面部属性是非常具有挑战性的。这个问题的关键是建立适当的特征表示来应对这些不利的条件。鉴于卷积神经网络（CNN）在图像分类中的成功，高级CNN特征作为一种直观而合理的选择，已被广泛应用于这个问题。然而，在本文中，我们将中级CNN特征看作是用于属性预测的高级别特征的替代。这是基于观察脸部属性是不同的：其中一些是本地导向的，而另一些是全局定义的。我们的调查显示，中等深度的表示要比（精细调整的）高层抽象的预测精度要好。我们凭经验证明，中层代表在CelebA和LFWA数据集上实现了最先进的预测性能。我们的调查还表明，通过利用中级表示，可以使用单个深度网络来实现人脸识别和属性预测。
