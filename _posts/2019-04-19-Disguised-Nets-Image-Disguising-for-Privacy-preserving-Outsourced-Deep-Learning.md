##### Abstract
Deep learning model developers often use cloud GPU resources to experiment with large data and models that need expensive setups. However, this practice raises privacy concerns. Adversaries may be interested in: 1) personally identifiable information or objects encoded in the training images, and 2) the models trained with sensitive data to launch model-based attacks. Learning deep neural networks (DNN) from encrypted data is still impractical due to the large training data and the expensive learning process. A few recent studies have tried to provide efficient, practical solutions to protect data privacy in outsourced deep-learning. However, we find out that they are vulnerable under certain attacks. In this paper, we specifically identify two types of unique attacks on outsourced deep-learning: 1) the visual re-identification attack on the training data, and 2) the class membership attack on the learned models, which can break existing privacy-preserving solutions. We develop an image disguising approach to address these attacks and design a suite of methods to evaluate the levels of attack resilience for a privacy-preserving solution for outsourced deep learning. The experimental results show that our image-disguising mechanisms can provide a high level of protection against the two attacks while still generating high-quality DNN models for image classification.
