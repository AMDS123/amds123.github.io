##### Abstract
With the aim of investigating the possible integration of opto-electronic devices, epitaxial GaN layers have been grown on Si(111) SOI and on Si/CoSi2/Si(111) using metalorganic chemical vapor deposition. The samples are found to possess a highly oriented wurtzite structure, a uniform thickness and abrupt interfaces. The epitaxial orientation is determined as GaN(0001)//Si(111), GaN[1120]//Si[110] and GaN[1010]//Si[112], and the GaN layer is tensily strained in the direction parallel to the interface. According to Rutherford backscattering/channeling spectrometry and (0002) rocking curves, the crystalline quality of GaN on Si(111) SOI is better than that of GaN on silicide. Room-temperature photoluminescence of GaN/SOI reveals a strong near-bandedge emission at 368 nm (3.37 eV) with an FWHM of 59 meV.
