##### Abstract
The field of cryo-electron microscopy has made astounding advancements in the past few years, mainly due to improvements in the hardware of the microscopes. Yet, one of the key open challenges of the field remains the processing of heterogeneous data sets, produced from samples containing particles at several different conformational states. For such data sets, one must first classify their images into homogeneous groups, where each group corresponds to the same underlying structure, followed by reconstruction of a three-dimensional model from each of the homogeneous groups. This task has been proven to be extremely difficult. In this paper we present an iterative algorithm for processing heterogeneous data sets that combines the classification and reconstruction steps. We prove accuracy and stability bounds on the algorithm, and demonstrate it on simulated as well as experimental data sets.

低温电子显微镜领域在过去几年取得了惊人的进步，主要是由于显微镜硬件的改进。然而，该领域的一个关键的开放挑战仍然是处理由包含处于几种不同构象状态的粒子的样品产生的异质数据集。对于这样的数据集，首先必须将它们的图像分类为均质组，其中每个组对应于相同的基础结构，随后从每个同质组重建三维模型。这项任务已被证明是非常困难的。在本文中，我们提出了一种处理异构数据集的迭代算法，结合了分类和重建步骤。我们证明了算法的准确性和稳定性的界限，并在模拟和实验数据集上进行了验证。
