##### Abstract
We designed a gangue sorting system,and built a convolutional neural network model based on AlexNet. Data enhancement and transfer learning are used to solve the problem which the convolution neural network has insufficient training data in the training stage. An object detection and region clipping algorithm is proposed to adjust the training image data to the optimum size. Compared with traditional neural network and SVM algorithm, this algorithm has higher recognition rate for coal and coal gangue, and provides important reference for identification and separation of coal and gangue.

我们设计了一个煤矸石分拣系统，并建立了一个基于AlexNet的卷积神经网络模型。利用数据增强和传递学习来解决训练阶段卷积神经网络训练数据不足的问题。提出一种物体检测和区域裁剪算法，将训练图像数据调整到最佳尺寸。该算法与传统的神经网络和支持向量机算法相比，对煤和煤矸石的识别率较高，为煤矸石识别分离提供了重要参考。
