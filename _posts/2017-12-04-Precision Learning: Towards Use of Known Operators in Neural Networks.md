##### Abstract
In this paper, we consider the use of prior knowledge within neural networks. In particular, we investigate the effect of a known transform within the mapping from input data space to the output domain. We demonstrate that use of known transforms is able to change maximal error bounds. </p> <p>In order to explore the effect further, we consider the problem of X-ray material decomposition as an example to incorporate additional prior knowledge. We demonstrate that inclusion of a non-linear function known from the physical properties of the system is able to reduce prediction errors therewith improving prediction quality from SSIM values of 0.54 to 0.88. </p> <p>This approach is applicable to a wide set of applications in physics and signal processing that provide prior knowledge on such transforms. Also maximal error estimation and network understanding could be facilitated within the context of precision learning.

在本文中，我们考虑在神经网络中使用先验知识。特别是，我们研究了从输入数据空间到输出域的映射中已知变换的效果。我们证明使用已知的变换能够改变最大的误差范围。为了进一步探索这个效应，我们把X射线材料分解的问题作为一个例子来结合额外的先验知识。我们证明，从系统的物理特性中已知的非线性函数的包含能够减少预测误差，从而改善SSIM值为0.54到0.88的预测质量。这种方法适用于广泛的物理和信号处理应用，提供有关这种变换的先验知识。在精确学习的背景下，也可以促进最大误差估计和网络理解。
