##### Abstract
The use of 3D and stereo imaging is rapidly increasing. Compression, transmission, and processing could degrade the quality of stereo images. Quality assessment of such images is different than their 2D counterparts. Metrics that represent 3D perception by human visual system (HVS) are expected to assess stereoscopic quality more accurately. In this paper, inspired by brain sensory/motor fusion process, two stereo images are fused together. Then from every fused image two synthesized images are extracted. Effects of different distortions on statistical distributions of the synthesized images are shown. Based on the observed statistical changes, features are extracted from these synthesized images. These features can reveal type and severity of distortions. Then, a stacked neural network model is proposed, which learns the extracted features and accurately evaluates the quality of stereo images. This model is tested on 3D images of popular databases. Experimental results show the superiority of this method over state of the art stereo image quality assessment approaches

3D和立体成像的使用正在迅速增加。压缩，传输和处理可能会降低立体图像的质量。这些图像的质量评估不同于2D图像。代表人类视觉系统（HVS）的3D感知的指标预期更准确地评估立体质量。在本文中，受大脑感觉/运动融合过程的启发，两个立体图像融合在一起。然后从每个融合图像提取两个合成图像。显示了不同失真对合成图像统计分布的影响。基于观察到的统计变化，从这些合成图像中提取特征。这些功能可以显示扭曲的类型和严重程度。然后，提出了一种叠加神经网络模型，该模型可以学习提取的特征，准确评估立体图像的质量。该模型在流行数据库的3D图像上进行测试。实验结果表明，这种方法优于最先进的立体图像质量评估方法
