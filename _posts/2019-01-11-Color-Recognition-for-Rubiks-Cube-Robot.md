##### Abstract
In this paper, we proposed three methods to solve color recognition of Rubik's cube, which includes one offline method and two online methods. Scatter balance \&amp; extreme learning machine (SB-ELM), a offline method, is proposed to illustrate the efficiency of training based method. We also point out the conception of color drifting which indicates offline methods are always ineffectiveness and can not work well in continuous change circumstance. By contrast, dynamic weight label propagation is proposed for labeling blocks color by known center blocks color of Rubik's cube. Furthermore, weak label hierarchic propagation, another online method, is also proposed for unknown all color information but only utilizes weak label of center block in color recognition. We finally design a Rubik's cube robot and construct a dataset to illustrate the efficiency and effectiveness of our online methods and to indicate the ineffectiveness of offline method by color drifting in our dataset.
