##### Abstract
The infeasible parts of the objective space in difficult many-objective optimization problems cause trouble for evolutionary algorithms. This paper proposes a reference vector based algorithm which uses two interacting engines to adapt the reference vectors and to evolve the population towards the true Pareto Front (PF) s.t. the reference vectors are always evenly distributed within the current PF to provide appropriate guidance for selection. The current PF is tracked by maintaining an archive of undominated individuals, and adaptation of reference vectors is conducted with the help of another archive that contains layers of reference vectors corresponding to different density. Experimental results show the expected characteristics and competitive performance of the proposed algorithm TEEA.
