##### Abstract
Vehicle Make and Model Recognition (MMR) systems provide a fully automatic framework to recognize and classify different vehicle models. Several approaches have been proposed to address this challenge, however they can perform in restricted conditions. Here, we formulate the vehicle make and model recognition as a fine-grained classification problem and propose a new configurable on-road vehicle make and model recognition framework. We benefit from the unsupervised feature learning methods and in more details we employ Locality constraint Linear Coding (LLC) method as a fast feature encoder for encoding the input SIFT features. The proposed method can perform in real environments of different conditions. This framework can recognize fifty models of vehicles and has an advantage to classify every other vehicle not belonging to one of the specified fifty classes as an unknown vehicle. The proposed MMR framework can be configured to become faster or more accurate based on the application domain. The proposed approach is examined on two datasets including Iranian on-road vehicle dataset and CompuCar dataset. The Iranian on-road vehicle dataset contains images of 50 models of vehicles captured in real situations by traffic cameras in different weather and lighting conditions. Experimental results show superiority of the proposed framework over the state-of-the-art methods on Iranian on-road vehicle datatset and comparable results on CompuCar dataset with 97.5% and 98.4% accuracies, respectively.

车辆制造和模型识别（MMR）系统提供了一个全自动框架来识别和分类不同的车辆模型。已经提出了几种方法来解决这个挑战，但是它们可以在有限的条件下执行。在这里，我们将车辆制造和模型识别制定为细粒度分类问题，并提出了一种新的可配置的车辆制造和模型识别框架。我们受益于无监督特征学习方法，更详细地说，我们采用局部约束线性编码（LLC）方法作为用于对输入SIFT特征进行编码的快速特征编码器。所提出的方法可以在不同条件的实际环境中执行。该框架可以识别五十种车辆模型，并有利于将不属于指定五十个类别之一的其他车辆分类为未知车辆。建议的MMR框架可以配置为基于应用程序域变得更快或更准确。所提出的方法在包括伊朗道路车辆数据集和CompuCar数据集在内的两个数据集上进行检查。伊朗的道路车辆数据集包含在不同天气和照明条件下由交通摄像头在实际情况下拍摄的50种车型的图像。实验结果表明，所提出的框架优于伊朗道路车辆数据集的现有技术方法，CompuCar数据集的可比结果分别为97.5％和98.4％。
