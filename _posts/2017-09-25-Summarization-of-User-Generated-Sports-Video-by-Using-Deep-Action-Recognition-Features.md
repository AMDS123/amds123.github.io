##### Abstract
Automatically generating a summary of sports video poses the challenge of detecting interesting moments, or highlights, of a game. Traditional sports video summarization methods leverage editing conventions of broadcast sports video that facilitate the extraction of high-level semantics. However, user-generated videos are not edited, and thus traditional methods are not suitable to generate a summary. In order to solve this problem, this work proposes a novel video summarization method that uses players' actions as a cue to determine the highlights of the original video. A deep neural network-based approach is used to extract two types of action-related features and to classify video segments into interesting or uninteresting parts. The proposed method can be applied to any sports in which games consist of a succession of actions. Especially, this work considers the case of Kendo (Japanese fencing) as an example of a sport to evaluate the proposed method. The method is trained using Kendo videos with ground truth labels that indicate the video highlights. The labels are provided by annotators possessing different experience with respect to Kendo to demonstrate how the proposed method adapts to different needs. The performance of the proposed method is compared with several combinations of different features, and the results show that it outperforms previous summarization methods.

自动生成运动视频的摘要构成了检测游戏的有趣时刻或亮点的挑战。传统体育视频摘要方法利用广播体育视频的编辑惯例来促进高层语义的提取。但是，用户生成的视频不会被编辑，因此传统方法不适合生成摘要。为了解决这个问题，本文提出了一种新的视频摘要方法，以玩家的动作为线索，确定原始视频的亮点。基于深度神经网络的方法被用来提取两种类型的动作相关特征，并将视频片段分类为有趣或无趣的部分。所提出的方法可以应用于游戏由一系列动作组成的任何运动。尤其是，本文将剑道（日本击剑）作为一项运动的例子来评估所提出的方法。该方法训练使用Kendo视频与地面真相标签，指示视频的亮点。标签由具有不同经验的注释者提供，以证明所提出的方法如何适应不同的需求。将所提方法的性能与不同特征的几种组合进行比较，结果表明，该方法优于以往的总结方法。
