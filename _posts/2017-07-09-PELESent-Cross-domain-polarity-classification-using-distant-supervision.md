##### Abstract
The enormous amount of texts published daily by Internet users has fostered the development of methods to analyze this content in several natural language processing areas, such as sentiment analysis. The main goal of this task is to classify the polarity of a message. Even though many approaches have been proposed for sentiment analysis, some of the most successful ones rely on the availability of large annotated corpus, which is an expensive and time-consuming process. In recent years, distant supervision has been used to obtain larger datasets. So, inspired by these techniques, in this paper we extend such approaches to incorporate popular graphic symbols used in electronic messages, the emojis, in order to create a large sentiment corpus for Portuguese. Trained on almost one million tweets, several models were tested in both same domain and cross-domain corpora. Our methods obtained very competitive results in five annotated corpora from mixed domains (Twitter and product reviews), which proves the domain-independent property of such approach. In addition, our results suggest that the combination of emoticons and emojis is able to properly capture the sentiment of a message.

互联网用户每天发布的大量文本促进了在情感分析等自然语言处理领域内分析这些内容的方法的发展。这个任务的主要目标是分类消息的极性。尽管已经提出了许多用于情感分析的方法，但是一些最成功的方法依赖于大量带注释的语料库的可用性，这是昂贵和耗时的过程。近年来，遥远的监督已经被用来获取更大的数据集。因此，在这些技巧的启发下，本文中我们扩展了这些方法，以结合电子信息中使用的流行图形符号 - 表情符号，为葡萄牙人创造一个大型的情感语料库。在几乎一百万条推文上进行训练，几个模型在相同领域和跨领域语料库进行了测试。我们的方法在来自混合域（Twitter和产品评论）的五个带注释的语料库中获得了非常有竞争力的结果，这证明了这种方法的领域独立属性。此外，我们的结果表明，表情符号和表情符号的组合能够恰当地捕捉到消息的情绪。
