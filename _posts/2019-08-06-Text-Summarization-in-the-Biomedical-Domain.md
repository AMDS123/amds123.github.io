##### Abstract
This chapter gives an overview of recent advances in the field of biomedical text summarization. Different types of challenges are introduced, and methods are discussed concerning the type of challenge that they address. Biomedical literature summarization is explored as a leading trend in the field, and some future lines of work are pointed out. Underlying methods of recent summarization systems are briefly explained and the most significant evaluation results are mentioned. The primary purpose of this chapter is to review the most significant research efforts made in the current decade toward new methods of biomedical text summarization. As the main parts of this chapter, current trends are discussed and new challenges are introduced.
