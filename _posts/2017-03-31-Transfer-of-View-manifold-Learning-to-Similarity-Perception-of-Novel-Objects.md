##### Abstract
We develop a model of perceptual similarity judgment based on re-training a deep convolution neural network (DCNN) that learns to associate different views of each 3D object to capture the notion of object persistence and continuity in our visual experience. The re-training process effectively performs distance metric learning under the object persistency constraints, to modify the view-manifold of object representations. It reduces the effective distance between the representations of different views of the same object without compromising the distance between those of the views of different objects, resulting in the untangling of the view-manifolds between individual objects within the same category and across categories. This untangling enables the model to discriminate and recognize objects within the same category, independent of viewpoints. We found that this ability is not limited to the trained objects, but transfers to novel objects in both trained and untrained categories, as well as to a variety of completely novel artificial synthetic objects. This transfer in learning suggests the modification of distance metrics in view- manifolds is more general and abstract, likely at the levels of parts, and independent of the specific objects or categories experienced during training. Interestingly, the resulting transformation of feature representation in the deep networks is found to significantly better match human perceptual similarity judgment than AlexNet, suggesting that object persistence could be an important constraint in the development of perceptual similarity judgment in biological neural networks.

##### Abstract (translated by Google)
我们开发了一个基于重新训练深度卷积神经网络（DCNN）的知觉相似性判断模型，学习将每个3D对象的不同视图关联起来，以捕捉对象持久性和连续性的概念。重新训练过程在对象持久性约束下有效地执行距离度量学习，以修改对象表示的视图流形。它减少了同一对象不同视图表示之间的有效距离，同时又不影响不同对象视图之间的距离，从而导致同一类别内和不同类别内的各个对象之间的视图 - 流形之间的分离。这种分离使得模型能够区分和识别同一类别内的对象，而与观点无关。我们发现，这种能力不仅限于训练的对象，而是在训练和未训练的类别中转移到新的对象，以及各种全新的人造合成对象。学习中的这种转移表明，视图中的距离度量标准的修改更为一般和抽象，可能在各个部分的级别上，并且与训练期间所经历的特定对象或类别无关。有趣的是，深层网络中特征表示的转换发现比AlexNet更能匹配人类知觉相似性判断，表明对象持久性可能是生物神经网络知觉相似性判断发展的重要制约因素。
