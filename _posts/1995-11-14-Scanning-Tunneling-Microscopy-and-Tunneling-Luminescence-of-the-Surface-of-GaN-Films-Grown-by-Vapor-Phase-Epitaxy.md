##### Abstract
We report scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) images of surfaces of GaN films and the observation of luminescence from those films induced by highly spatially localized injection of electrons or holes using STM. This combination of scanning tunneling luminescence (STL) with STM for GaN surfaces and the ability to observe both morphology and luminescence in GaN is the first step to investigate possible correlations between surface morphology and optical properties.
