##### Abstract
The trend towards increasingly deep neural networks has been driven by a general observation that increasing depth increases the performance of a network. Recently, however, evidence has been amassing that simply increasing depth may not be the best way to increase performance, particularly given other limitations. Investigations into deep residual networks have also suggested that they may not in fact be operating as a single deep network, but rather as an ensemble of many relatively shallow networks. We examine these issues, and in doing so arrive at a new interpretation of the unravelled view of deep residual networks which explains some of the behaviours that have been observed experimentally. As a result, we are able to derive a new, shallower, architecture of residual networks which significantly outperforms much deeper models such as ResNet-200 on the ImageNet classification dataset. We also show that this performance is transferable to other problem domains by developing a semantic segmentation approach which outperforms the state-of-the-art by a remarkable margin on datasets including PASCAL VOC, PASCAL Context, and Cityscapes. The architecture that we propose thus outperforms its comparators, including very deep ResNets, and yet is more efficient in memory use and sometimes also in training time. The code and models are available at this https URL

越来越深的神经网络的趋势一直是由一个普遍的观察所驱动的，即深度的增加会提高网络的性能。然而最近有证据表明，单纯增加深度可能不是提高性能的最佳方式，特别是考虑到其他限制。对深度残差网络的调查也表明，它们实际上可能不是作为一个单一的深层网络运行，而是作为许多相对较浅的网络的集合。我们研究这些问题，并在此基础上对深层残余网络的解构观点进行了新的解释，这解释了实验观察到的一些行为。因此，我们能够推导出一种新的更浅的残余网络结构，这种网络在ImageNet分类数据集上的性能远远优于更深的模型，如ResNet-200。我们还表明，通过开发语义分割方法，这种性能可以转移到其他问题领域，这种方法在包括PASCAL VOC，PASCAL Context和Cityscapes在内的数据集上显着优于现有技术。我们提出的体系结构胜过比较器，包括非常深的ResNets，而且在内存使用方面更有效率，有时也在培训时间。代码和模型可在此https URL中找到
