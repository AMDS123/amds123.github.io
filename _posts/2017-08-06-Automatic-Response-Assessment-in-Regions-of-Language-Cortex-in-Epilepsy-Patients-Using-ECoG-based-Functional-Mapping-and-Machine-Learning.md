##### Abstract
Accurate localization of brain regions responsible for language and cognitive functions in Epilepsy patients should be carefully determined prior to surgery. Electrocorticography (ECoG)-based Real Time Functional Mapping (RTFM) has been shown to be a safer alternative to the electrical cortical stimulation mapping (ESM), which is currently the clinical/gold standard. Conventional methods for analyzing RTFM signals are based on statistical comparison of signal power at certain frequency bands. Compared to gold standard (ESM), they have limited accuracies when assessing channel responses. In this study, we address the accuracy limitation of the current RTFM signal estimation methods by analyzing the full frequency spectrum of the signal and replacing signal power estimation methods with machine learning algorithms, specifically random forest (RF), as a proof of concept. We train RF with power spectral density of the time-series RTFM signal in supervised learning framework where ground truth labels are obtained from the ESM. Results obtained from RTFM of six adult patients in a strictly controlled experimental setup reveal the state of the art detection accuracy of $\approx 78\%$ for the language comprehension task, an improvement of $23\%$ over the conventional RTFM estimation method. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study exploring the use of machine learning approaches for determining RTFM signal characteristics, and using the whole-frequency band for better region localization. Our results demonstrate the feasibility of machine learning based RTFM signal analysis method over the full spectrum to be a clinical routine in the near future.

精确定位癫痫患者语言和认知功能的大脑区域应在手术前仔细确定。已经显示基于脑电图（ECoG）的实时功能映射（RTFM）是目前临床/金标准的电皮层刺激映射（ESM）的更安全的替代方案。用于分析RTFM信号的传统方法基于某些频带处的信号功率的统计比较。与金标准（ESM）相比，在评估渠道响应时，它们的准确度有限。在本研究中，我们通过分析信号的全频谱，并用机器学习算法，特别是随机森林（RF）来代替信号功率估计方法作为概念的证明，来解决当前RTFM信号估计方法的精度限制。我们利用监督学习框架对时间序列RTFM信号的功率谱密度进行RF训练，从ESM获得地面实况标签。在严格控制的实验设置中，六名成人患者的RTFM结果显示，语言理解任务的现有技术检测精度为$ 78％，比传统的RTFM估计方法提高了$ 23％。据我们所知，这是第一个探索使用机器学习方法来确定RTFM信号特性，并使用全频带来更好的区域定位的研究。我们的研究结果表明基于机器学习的RTFM信号分析方法在整个频谱上的可行性是近期的临床常规。
