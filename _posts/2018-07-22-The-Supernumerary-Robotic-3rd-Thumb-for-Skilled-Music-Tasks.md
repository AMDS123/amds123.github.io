##### Abstract
Wearable robotics bring the opportunity to augment human capability and performance, be it through prosthetics, exoskeletons, or supernumerary robotic limbs. The latter concept allows enhancing human performance and assisting them in daily tasks. An important research question is, however, whether the use of such devices can lead to their eventual cognitive embodiment, allowing the user to adapt to them and use them seamlessly as any other limb of their own. This paper describes the creation of a platform to investigate this. Our supernumerary robotic 3rd thumb was created to augment piano playing, allowing a pianist to press piano keys beyond their natural hand-span; thus leading to functional augmentation of their skills and the technical feasibility to play with 11 fingers. The robotic finger employs sensors, motors, and a human interfacing algorithm to control its movement in real-time. A proof of concept validation experiment has been conducted to show the effectiveness of the robotic finger in playing musical pieces on a grand piano, showing that naive users were able to use it for 11 finger play within a few hours.

可穿戴式机器人技术带来了增强人类能力和性能的机会，无论是通过假肢，外骨骼还是编外的机器人肢体。后一概念允许提高人的表现并协助他们完成日常任务。然而，一个重要的研究问题是，这些设备的使用是否可以导致它们最终的认知实施例，允许用户适应它们并将它们无缝地用作它们自己的任何其他肢体。本文描述了创建一个平台来研究这个问题。我们的编外机器人第三拇指是为了增强钢琴演奏而创作的，它允许钢琴家按钢琴键超出其自然的手掌范围。从而导致他们的技能的功能增强和用11个手指玩的技术可行性。机器人手指采用传感器，电机和人机接口算法来实时控制其运动。已经进行了概念验证验证实验以显示机器人手指在三角钢琴上演奏音乐作品的有效性，表明天真的用户能够在几小时内将其用于11个手指演奏。
