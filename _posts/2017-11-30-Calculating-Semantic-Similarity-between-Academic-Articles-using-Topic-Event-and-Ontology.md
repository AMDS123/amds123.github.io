##### Abstract
Determining semantic similarity between academic documents is crucial to many tasks such as plagiarism detection, automatic technical survey and semantic search. Current studies mostly focus on semantic similarity between concepts, sentences and short text fragments. However, document-level semantic matching is still based on statistical information in surface level, neglecting article structures and global semantic meanings, which may cause the deviation in document understanding. In this paper, we focus on the document-level semantic similarity issue for academic literatures with a novel method. We represent academic articles with topic events that utilize multiple information profiles, such as research purposes, methodologies and domains to integrally describe the research work, and calculate the similarity between topic events based on the domain ontology to acquire the semantic similarity between articles. Experiments show that our approach achieves significant performance compared to state-of-the-art methods.

确定学术文献之间的语义相似性对于抄袭检测，自动技术调查和语义检索等许多任务至关重要。目前的研究主要集中在概念，句子和短文本片段之间的语义相似性。然而，文档级的语义匹配仍然是基于表层级的统计信息，忽略了文章结构和全局语义的含义，这可能造成文档理解的偏差。在本文中，我们用一种新的方法来关注学术文献的文档级语义相似性问题。我们用主题事件表示学术论文，利用多个信息概况，如研究目的，方法论和领域，整体描述研究工作，基于领域本体计算主题事件之间的相似度，获得论文之间的语义相似度。实验表明，与最先进的方法相比，我们的方法实现了显着的性能。
