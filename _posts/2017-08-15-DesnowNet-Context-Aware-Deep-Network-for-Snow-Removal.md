##### Abstract
Existing learning-based atmospheric particle-removal approaches such as those used for rainy and hazy images are designed with strong assumptions regarding spatial frequency, trajectory, and translucency. However, the removal of snow particles is more complicated because it possess the additional attributes of particle size and shape, and these attributes may vary within a single image. Currently, hand-crafted features are still the mainstream for snow removal, making significant generalization difficult to achieve. In response, we have designed a multistage network codenamed DesnowNet to in turn deal with the removal of translucent and opaque snow particles. We also differentiate snow into attributes of translucency and chromatic aberration for accurate estimation. Moreover, our approach individually estimates residual complements of the snow-free images to recover details obscured by opaque snow. Additionally, a multi-scale design is utilized throughout the entire network to model the diversity of snow. As demonstrated in experimental results, our approach outperforms state-of-the-art learning-based atmospheric phenomena removal methods and one semantic segmentation baseline on the proposed Snow100K dataset in both qualitative and quantitative comparisons. The results indicate our network would benefit applications involving computer vision and graphics.

现有的基于学习的大气颗粒去除方法，例如用于多雨和模糊图像的方法，在空间频率，轨迹和半透明度方面都有很强的假设。然而，雪粒的去除更复杂，因为它具有粒子尺寸和形状的附加属性，并且这些属性可以在单个图像内变化。目前，手工制作的功能仍然是除雪的主流，难以实现显着的泛化。作为回应，我们设计了一个代号为DesnowNet的多级网络来处理半透明和不透明的积雪颗粒。我们还将雪分为半透明和色差的属性，以进行准确估计。此外，我们的方法单独估计无雪图像的残余补充，以恢复被不透明雪覆盖的细节。另外，在整个网络中使用多尺度设计来模拟雪的多样性。正如实验结果所证明的那样，我们的方法在定性和定量比较中优于最新的基于学习的大气现象去除方法和提议的Snow100K数据集上的语义分割基线。结果表明我们的网络将有利于涉及计算机视觉和图形的应用。
