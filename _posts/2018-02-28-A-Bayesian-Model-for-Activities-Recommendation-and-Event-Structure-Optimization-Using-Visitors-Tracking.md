##### Abstract
In events that are composed by many activities, there is a problem that involves retrieve and management the information of visitors that are visiting the activities. This management is crucial to find some activities that are drawing attention of visitors; identify an ideal positioning for activities; which path is more frequented by visitors. In this work, these features are studied using Complex Network theory. For the beginning, an artificial database was generated to study the mentioned features. Secondly, this work shows a method to optimize the event structure that is better than a random method and a recommendation system that achieves ~95% of accuracy.

在由许多活动组成的活动中，存在涉及检索和管理正在访问活动的访问者的信息的问题。这种管理对于发现吸引访客注意的活动至关重要;确定活动的理想定位;哪条路线更受游客的喜爱。在这项工作中，使用复杂网络理论研究这些特征。首先，生成人造数据库来研究上述功能。其次，这项工作展示了一种优化事件结构的方法，该方法优于随机方法和推荐系统，该系统可以达到95％的准确度。
