##### Abstract
Nonlocal self-similarity and group sparsity have been widely utilized in image compressive sensing (CS). However, when the sampling rate is low, the internal prior information of degraded images may be not enough for accurate restoration, resulting in loss of image edges and details. In this paper, we propose a joint group and residual sparse coding method for CS image recovery (JGRSC-CS). In the proposed JGRSC-CS, patch group is treated as the basic unit of sparse coding and two dictionaries (namely internal and external dictionaries) are applied to exploit the sparse representation of each group simultaneously. The internal self-adaptive dictionary is used to remove artifacts, and an external Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) dictionary, learned from clean training images, is used to enhance details and texture. To make the proposed method effective and robust, the split Bregman method is adopted to reconstruct the whole image. Experimental results manifest the proposed JGRSC-CS algorithm outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in both peak signal to noise ratio (PSNR) and visual quality.
