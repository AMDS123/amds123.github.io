##### Abstract
Despite being very successful within the pattern recognition and machine learning community, graph-based methods are often unusable with many machine learning tools. This is because of the incompatibility of most of the mathematical operations in graph domain. Graph embedding has been proposed as a way to tackle these difficulties, which maps graphs to a vector space and makes the standard machine learning techniques applicable for them. However, it is well known that graph embedding techniques usually suffer from the loss of structural information. In this paper, given a graph, we consider its hierarchical structure for mapping it into a vector space. The hierarchical structure is constructed by topologically clustering the graph nodes, and considering each cluster as a node in the upper hierarchical level. Once this hierarchical structure of graph is constructed, we consider its various configurations of its parts, and use stochastic graphlet embedding (SGE) for mapping them into vector space. Broadly speaking, SGE produces a distribution of uniformly sampled low to high order graphlets as a way to embed graphs into the vector space. In what follows, the coarse-to-fine structure of a graph hierarchy and the statistics fetched through the distribution of low to high order stochastic graphlets complements each other and include important structural information with varied contexts. Altogether, these two techniques substantially cope with the usual information loss involved in graph embedding techniques, and it is not a surprise that we obtain more robust vector space embedding of graphs. This fact has been corroborated through a detailed experimental evaluation on various benchmark graph datasets, where we outperform the state-of-the-art methods.

尽管在模式识别和机器学习社区中非常成功，但基于图形的方法通常无法用于许多机器学习工具。这是因为图域中大多数数学运算的不兼容性。已经提出图形嵌入作为解决这些困难的方法，其将图形映射到向量空间并使得标准机器学习技术适用于它们。然而，众所周知，图嵌入技术通常会遭受结构信息的损失。在本文中，给出一个图，我们考虑它的层次结构，将其映射到向量空间。通过拓扑聚类图节点并将每个聚类视为上层级中的节点来构造层级结构。一旦构建了图的这种层次结构，我们就会考虑其各部分的各种配置，并使用随机图基础嵌入（SGE）将它们映射到向量空间。从广义上讲，SGE生成均匀采样的低阶到高阶图的分布，作为将图嵌入向量空间的一种方法。在下文中，图层次结构的粗到细结构和通过低到高阶随机图的分布获得的统计数据相互补充，并包括具有不同上下文的重要结构信息。总而言之，这两种技术基本上处理了图嵌入技术中常见的信息丢失，并且我们获得更稳健的图矢量空间嵌入并不奇怪。通过对各种基准图数据集的详细实验评估证实了这一事实，其中我们优于最先进的方法。
