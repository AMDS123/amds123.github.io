##### Abstract
Jenny 5 is a fully open-source robot intended to be used mainly for research but can also act as a human assistant. It has a mobile platform with rubber tracks, a flexible leg, two arms with 7 degrees of freedom each and head with 2 degrees of freedom. The robot is actuated by 20 motors (DC, steppers and servos) and its state is read with the help of many sensors. The robot also has 3 webcams for computer vision tasks. In this paper the current state of the robot is described.
