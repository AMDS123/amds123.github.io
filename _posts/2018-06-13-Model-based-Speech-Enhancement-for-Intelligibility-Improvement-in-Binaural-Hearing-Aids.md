##### Abstract
Speech intelligibility is often severely degraded among hearing impaired individuals in situations such as the cocktail party scenario. The performance of the current hearing aid technology has been observed to be limited in these scenarios. In this paper, we propose a binaural speech enhancement framework that takes into consideration the speech production model. The enhancement framework proposed here is based on the Kalman filter that allows us to take the speech production dynamics into account during the enhancement process. The usage of a Kalman filter requires the estimation of clean speech and noise short term predictor (STP) parameters, and the clean speech pitch parameters. In this work, a binaural codebook-based method is proposed for estimating the STP parameters, and a directional pitch estimator based on the harmonic model and maximum likelihood principle is used to estimate the pitch parameters. The proposed method for estimating the STP and pitch parameters jointly uses the information from left and right ears, leading to a more robust estimation of the filter parameters. Objective measures such as PESQ and STOI have been used to evaluate the enhancement framework in different acoustic scenarios representative of the cocktail party scenario. We have also conducted subjective listening tests on a set of nine normal hearing subjects, to evaluate the performance in terms of intelligibility and quality improvement. The listening tests show that the proposed algorithm, even with access to only a single channel noisy observation, significantly improves the overall speech quality, and the speech intelligibility by up to 15%.

在诸如鸡尾酒会场景的情况下，听力受损个体中的语言可懂度通常严重降低。在这些情况下，观察到当前助听器技术的性能有限。在本文中，我们提出了一个兼顾语音生成模型的双耳语音增强框架。这里提出的增强框架基于卡尔曼滤波器，它允许我们在增强过程中考虑语音生产动态。使用卡尔曼滤波器需要估计干净的语音和噪声短期预测器（STP）参数以及干净的语音音调参数。在这项工作中，基于双耳码本的方法被提出用于估计STP参数，并且基于谐波模型和最大似然原理的方向基音估计器被用于估计音调参数。所提出的用于估计STP和音调参数的方法联合使用来自左耳和右耳的信息，导致对滤波器参数的更强健的估计。诸如PESQ和STOI之类的客观衡量标准已用于评估代表鸡尾酒会场景的不同声学场景中的增强框架。我们还对一组9名正常听力受试者进行了主观听力测试，以评估可懂度和质量改善方面的表现。聆听测试表明，即使只有单通道噪声观测，所提出的算法也能显着提高整体语音质量，语音清晰度高达15％。
