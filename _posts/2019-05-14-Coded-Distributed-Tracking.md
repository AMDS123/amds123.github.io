##### Abstract
We consider the problem of tracking the state of a process that evolves over time in a distributed setting, with multiple observers each observing parts of the state, which is a fundamental information processing problem with a wide range of applications. We propose a cloud-assisted scheme where the tracking is performed over the cloud. In particular, to provide timely and accurate updates, and alleviate the straggler problem of cloud computing, we propose a coded distributed computing approach where coded observations are distributed over multiple workers. The proposed scheme is based on a coded version of the Kalman filter that operates on data encoded with an erasure correcting code, such that the state can be estimated from partial updates computed by a subset of the workers. We apply the proposed scheme to the problem of tracking multiple vehicles and show that it achieves significantly higher accuracy than that of a corresponding uncoded scheme and approaches the accuracy of an ideal centralized scheme when the update interval is large enough. Finally, we observe a trade-off between age-of-information and estimation accuracy.
