##### Abstract
With the increasing commoditization of computer vision, speech recognition and machine translation systems and the widespread deployment of learning-based back-end technologies such as digital advertising and intelligent infrastructures, AI (Artificial Intelligence) has moved from research labs to production. These changes have been made possible by unprecedented levels of data and computation, by methodological advances in machine learning, by innovations in systems software and architectures, and by the broad accessibility of these technologies. 
 The next generation of AI systems promises to accelerate these developments and increasingly impact our lives via frequent interactions and making (often mission-critical) decisions on our behalf, often in highly personalized contexts. Realizing this promise, however, raises daunting challenges. In particular, we need AI systems that make timely and safe decisions in unpredictable environments, that are robust against sophisticated adversaries, and that can process ever increasing amounts of data across organizations and individuals without compromising confidentiality. These challenges will be exacerbated by the end of the Moore's Law, which will constrain the amount of data these technologies can store and process. In this paper, we propose several open research directions in systems, architectures, and security that can address these challenges and help unlock AI's potential to improve lives and society.

##### Abstract (translated by Google)
随着计算机视觉，语音识别和机器翻译系统日益商品化，以及数字广告和智能基础设施等基于学习的后端技术的广泛部署，AI（人工智能）已经从研究实验室转向生产。前所未有的数据和计算水平，机器学习的方法学进步，系统软件和体系结构的创新以及这些技术的广泛可用性使这些变化成为可能。
 下一代AI系统有望加速这些发展，并通过频繁的交互和代表我们（通常是任务关键型）的决定（通常在高度个性化的环境中），加速这些发展并越来越影响我们的生活。然而，实现这一承诺会带来令人生畏的挑战。特别是，我们需要人工智能系统，能够在不可预测的环境中做出及时，安全的决策，这对复杂的对手来说是强大的，并且可以在不影响机密性的情况下处理越来越多的组织和个人的数据。摩尔定律的结束将加剧这些挑战，这将限制这些技术可以存储和处理的数据量。在本文中，我们提出了几个开放的系统，架构和安全研究方向，可以解决这些挑战，并有助于解开AI改善生活和社会的潜力。
