##### Abstract
Interventional C-arm imaging is crucial to percutaneous orthopedic procedures as it enables the surgeon to monitor the progress of surgery on the anatomy level. Minimally invasive interventions require repeated acquisition of X-ray images from different anatomical views to verify tool placement. Achieving and reproducing these views often comes at the cost of increased surgical time and radiation dose to both patient and staff. This work proposes a marker-free "technician-in-the-loop" Augmented Reality (AR) solution for C-arm repositioning. The X-ray technician operating the C-arm interventionally is equipped with a head-mounted display capable of recording desired C-arm poses in 3D via an integrated infrared sensor. For C-arm repositioning to a particular target view, the recorded C-arm pose is restored as a virtual object and visualized in an AR environment, serving as a perceptual reference for the technician. We conduct experiments in a setting simulating orthopedic trauma surgery. Our proof-of-principle findings indicate that the proposed system can decrease the 2.76 X-ray images required per desired view down to zero, suggesting substantial reductions of radiation dose during C-arm repositioning. The proposed AR solution is a first step towards facilitating communication between the surgeon and the surgical staff, improving the quality of surgical image acquisition, and enabling context-aware guidance for surgery rooms of the future. The concept of technician-in-the-loop design will become relevant to various interventions considering the expected advancements of sensing and wearable computing in the near future.

介入C型臂成像对经皮矫形手术至关重要，因为它使外科医生能够在解剖层面监测手术的进展。微创干预需要从不同解剖视图重复采集X射线图像以验证工具的位置。实现和复制这些观点往往需要增加患者和工作人员的手术时间和辐射剂量。这项工作提出了一种无标记的“技术人员在环”增强现实（AR）解决方案，用于C型臂重新定位。手术操作C型臂的X射线技术人员配备了头戴式显示器，可通过集成红外传感器以3D方式记录所需的C型臂姿势。为了将C形臂重新定位到特定的目标视图，记录的C形臂姿态被恢复为虚拟对象并在AR环境中可视化，作为技术人员的感知参考。我们在模拟骨科创伤手术的环境中进行实验。我们的原理验证结果表明，所提出的系统可以将每个期望视图所需的2.76X射线图像降低至零，这表明C形臂重新定位期间的辐射剂量显着降低。所提出的AR解决方案是促进外科医生与外科医生之间的交流，提高手术图像采集质量以及为未来的手术室启用情景感知指导的第一步。考虑到不久的将来传感和可穿戴计算的预期进步，技术人员在回路设计的概念将与各种干预措施相关。
