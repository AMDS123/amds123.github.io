##### Abstract
Limited-angle computed tomography (CT) is often used in clinical applications such as C-arm CT for interventional imaging. However, CT images from limited angles suffers from heavy artifacts due to incomplete projection data. Existing iterative methods require extensive calculations but can not deliver satisfactory results. Based on the observation that the artifacts from limited angles have some directional property and are globally distributed, we propose a novel multi-scale wavelet domain residual learning architecture, which compensates for the artifacts. Experiments have shown that the proposed method effectively eliminates artifacts, thereby preserving edge and global structures of the image.

有限角度计算机断层扫描（CT）经常用于临床应用，例如用于介入成像的C型臂CT。然而，由于不完整的投影数据，来自有限角度的CT图像遭受严重的伪影。现有的迭代方法需要大量的计算，但是不能提供令人满意的结果。基于有限角度伪像具有定向性和全局分布性的观点，提出了一种新的多尺度小波域残差学习结构，对伪像进行补偿。实验表明，所提出的方法有效地消除了伪像，从而保留了图像的边缘和全局结构。
