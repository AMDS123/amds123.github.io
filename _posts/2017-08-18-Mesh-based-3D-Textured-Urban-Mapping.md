##### Abstract
In the era of autonomous driving, urban mapping represents a core step to let vehicles interact with the urban context. Successful mapping algorithms have been proposed in the last decade building the map leveraging on data from a single sensor. The focus of the system presented in this paper is twofold: the joint estimation of a 3D map from lidar data and images, based on a 3D mesh, and its texturing. Indeed, even if most surveying vehicles for mapping are endowed by cameras and lidar, existing mapping algorithms usually rely on either images or lidar data; moreover both image-based and lidar-based systems often represent the map as a point cloud, while a continuous textured mesh representation would be useful for visualization and navigation purposes. In the proposed framework, we join the accuracy of the 3D lidar data, and the dense information and appearance carried by the images, in estimating a visibility consistent map upon the lidar measurements, and refining it photometrically through the acquired images. We evaluate the proposed framework against the KITTI dataset and we show the performance improvement with respect to two state of the art urban mapping algorithms, and two widely used surface reconstruction algorithms in Computer Graphics.

在自主驾驶时代，城市地图是让车辆与城市环境互动的核心步骤。成功的映射算法已经在过去的十年中提出了利用来自单个传感器的数据来构建地图。本文提出的系统的重点是双重的：基于3D网格的激光雷达数据和图像的3D地图的联合估计及其纹理。事实上，即使大多数测绘车辆都是由相机和激光雷达赋予的，现有的测绘算法通常依赖于图像或激光雷达数据，此外，基于图像的和基于激光雷达的系统通常将地图表示为点云，而连续纹理的网格表示对于可视化和导航目的将是有用的。在提出的框架中，我们结合三维激光雷达数据的准确性，以及图像所携带的密集信息和外观，在激光雷达测量时估计可见性一致性地图，并通过所获取的图像对其进行光度测定。我们评估提出的框架对抗KITTI数据集，我们展示了两个艺术城市映射算法和两个广泛使用的计算机图形表面重建算法的性能改进。
