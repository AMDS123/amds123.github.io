##### Abstract
Black-hole (BH) binaries with single-BH masses m=5--20 Msun, moving on quasicircular orbits, are among the most promising sources for first-generation ground-based gravitational-wave (GW) detectors. Until now, the development of data-analysis techniques to detect GWs from these sources has been focused mostly on nonspinning BHs. The data-analysis problem for the spinning case is complicated by the necessity to model the precession-induced modulations of the GW signal, and by the large number of parameters needed to characterize the system, including the initial directions of the spins, and the position and orientation of the binary with respect to the GW detector. In this paper we consider binaries of maximally spinning BHs, and we work in the adiabatic-inspiral regime to build families of modulated detection templates that (i) are functions of very few physical and phenomenological parameters, (ii) model remarkably well the dynamical and precessional effects on the GW signal, with fitting factors on average >~ 0.97, but (iii) might require increasing the detection thresholds, offsetting at least partially the gains in the fitting factors. Our detection-template families are quite promising also for the case of neutron-star--black-hole binaries, with fitting factors on average ~ 0.93. For these binaries we also suggest (but do not test) a further template family, which would produce essentially exact waveforms written directly in terms of the physical spin parameters.

具有单BH质量m = 5-20 Msun的黑洞（BH）二进制文件是在第一代基于地面的引力波（GW）探测器中最有前途的来源之一，在准圆形轨道上运动。到目前为止，从这些来源检测GWs的数据分析技术的发展主要集中在非纺织BHs上。纺纱箱的数据分析问题很复杂，因为需要对GW信号的进动引起的调制进行建模，还需要大量表征系统的参数，包括纺纱的初始方向和位置以及二进制相对于GW检测器的方向。在本文中，我们考虑最大旋转黑洞的二进制文件，我们在绝热 - 刺激体制下构建调制检测模板族，（i）是很少的物理和现象学参数的函数，（ii）非常好地模拟动力学和GW信号的进动效应，拟合因子平均> 0.97，但（iii）可能需要增加检测阈值，至少部分抵消拟合因子的增益。对于中子星 - 黑洞双星来说，我们的检测模板族也相当有希望，拟合因子平均为0.93。对于这些二进制文件，我们也建议（但不要测试）另一个模板族，这个模板族将直接根据物理旋转参数产生精确的波形。
