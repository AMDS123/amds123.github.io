##### Abstract
Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have been demonstrated to perform exceptionally well on most recognition tasks such as image classification and segmentation. However, they have also been shown to be vulnerable to adversarial examples. This phenomenon has recently attracted a lot of attention but it has not been extensively studied on multiple, large-scale datasets and complex tasks such as semantic segmentation which often require more specialised networks with additional components such as CRFs, dilated convolutions, skip-connections and multiscale processing. In this paper, we present what to our knowledge is the first rigorous evaluation of adversarial attacks on modern semantic segmentation models, using two large-scale datasets. We analyse the effect of different network architectures, model capacity and multiscale processing, and show that many observations made on the task of classification do not always transfer to this more complex task. Furthermore, we show how mean-field inference in deep structured models and multiscale processing naturally implement recently proposed adversarial defenses. Our observations will aid future efforts in understanding and defending against adversarial examples. Moreover, in the shorter term, we show which segmentation models should currently be preferred in safety-critical applications due to their inherent robustness.

深度神经网络（DNN）已被证明在大多数识别任务（例如图像分类和分割）方面表现出色。然而，它们也被证明容易受到敌对的例子。这种现象最近引起了很多的关注，但是它还没有被广泛地研究过多个大规模的数据集和复杂的任务，比如语义分割，这往往需要更多的专用网络和附加组件，如CRF，扩展卷积，跳过连接和多尺度处理。在本文中，我们介绍了使用两个大规模数据集对现代语义分割模型进行对抗性攻击的第一个严格评估。我们分析了不同网络体系结构，模型容量和多尺度处理的效果，表明对分类任务的许多观察并不总是转移到这个更复杂的任务上。此外，我们展示了深层结构模型和多尺度处理中的平均场推理如何自然地实现最近提出的对抗性防御。我们的观察将有助于今后努力理解和捍卫敌对的例子。此外，从短期来看，由于其固有的鲁棒性，我们显示哪些分段模型目前在安全关键应用中是首选的。
