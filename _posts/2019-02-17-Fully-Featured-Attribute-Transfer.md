##### Abstract
Image attribute transfer aims to change an input image to a target one with expected attributes, which has received significant attention in recent years. However, most of the existing methods lack the ability to de-correlate the target attributes and irrelevant information, i.e., the other attributes and background information, thus often suffering from blurs and artifacts. To address these issues, we propose a novel Attribute Manifold Encoding GAN (AME-GAN) for fully-featured attribute transfer, which can modify and adjust every detail in the images. Specifically, our method divides the input image into image attribute part and image background part on manifolds, which are controlled by attribute latent variables and background latent variables respectively. Through enforcing attribute latent variables to Gaussian distributions and background latent variables to uniform distributions respectively, the attribute transfer procedure becomes controllable and image generation is more photo-realistic. Furthermore, we adopt a conditional multi-scale discriminator to render accurate and high-quality target attribute images. Experimental results on three popular datasets demonstrate the superiority of our proposed method in both performances of the attribute transfer and image generation quality.
