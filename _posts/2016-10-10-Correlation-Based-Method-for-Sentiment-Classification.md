##### Abstract
The classic supervised classification algorithms are efficient, but time-consuming, complicated and not interpretable, which makes it difficult to analyze their results that limits the possibility to improve them based on real observations. In this paper, we propose a new and a simple classifier to predict a sentiment label of a short text. This model keeps the capacity of human interpret-ability and can be extended to integrate NLP techniques in a more interpretable way. Our model is based on a correlation metric which measures the degree of association between a sentiment label and a word. Ten correlation metrics are proposed and evaluated intrinsically. And then a classifier based on each metric is proposed, evaluated and compared to the classic classification algorithms which have proved their performance in many studies. Our model outperforms these algorithms with several correlation metrics.

经典的监督分类算法是有效的，但是费时，复杂且不可解释，这使得难以分析其结果，限制了基于实际观察来改进它们的可能性。在本文中，我们提出了一个新的简单的分类器来预测短文本的情感标签。这个模型保持了人类可解释性的能力，并且可以扩展到以更可理解的方式整合NLP技术。我们的模型是基于一个相关性度量标准，它衡量一个情感标签和一个词之间的关联程度。本质上提出并评估了十个相关度量。然后提出了一个基于每个度量的分类器，并对其进行了评估，并与经典的分类算法进行了比较，这些算法在许多研究中已经证明了其性能。我们的模型使用几个相关度量标准来胜过这些算法。
