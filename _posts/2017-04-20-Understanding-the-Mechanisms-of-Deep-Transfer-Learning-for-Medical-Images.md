##### Abstract
The ability to automatically learn task specific feature representations has led to a huge success of deep learning methods. When large training data is scarce, such as in medical imaging problems, transfer learning has been very effective. In this paper, we systematically investigate the process of transferring a Convolutional Neural Network, trained on ImageNet images to perform image classification, to kidney detection problem in ultrasound images. We study how the detection performance depends on the extent of transfer. We show that a transferred and tuned CNN can outperform a state-of-the-art feature engineered pipeline and a hybridization of these two techniques achieves 20\% higher performance. We also investigate how the evolution of intermediate response images from our network. Finally, we compare these responses to state-of-the-art image processing filters in order to gain greater insight into how transfer learning is able to effectively manage widely varying imaging regimes.

自动学习任务特定表征的能力已经导致了深度学习方法的巨大成功。当大量的训练数据很少时，比如在医学成像问题中，转移学习就非常有效。在本文中，我们系统地研究了在ImageNet图像上训练的卷积神经网络进行图像分类到超声图像中的肾脏检测问题的过程。我们研究如何检测性能取决于转移的程度。我们发现转移和调谐的CNN可以胜过最先进的功能工程管道，而这两种技术的混合实现了20％以上的性能。我们也研究如何从我们的网络中间响应图像的演变。最后，我们将这些响应与最先进的图像处理滤波器进行比较，以便更深入地了解转换学习如何能够有效管理广泛变化的成像机制。
