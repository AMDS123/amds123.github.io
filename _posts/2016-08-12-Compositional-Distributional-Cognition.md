##### Abstract
We accommodate the Integrated Connectionist/Symbolic Architecture (ICS) of [32] within the categorical compositional semantics (CatCo) of [13], forming a model of categorical compositional cognition (CatCog). This resolves intrinsic problems with ICS such as the fact that representations inhabit an unbounded space and that sentences with differing tree structures cannot be directly compared. We do so in a way that makes the most of the grammatical structure available, in contrast to strategies like circular convolution. Using the CatCo model also allows us to make use of tools developed for CatCo such as the representation of ambiguity and logical reasoning via density matrices, structural meanings for words such as relative pronouns, and addressing over- and under-extension, all of which are present in cognitive processes. Moreover the CatCog framework is sufficiently flexible to allow for entirely different representations of meaning, such as conceptual spaces. Interestingly, since the CatCo model was largely inspired by categorical quantum mechanics, so is CatCog.

##### Abstract (translated by Google)
我们在[13]的分类组合语义（CatCo）内容纳了[32]的集成连接符/符号体系结构（ICS），形成了分类组合认知模型（CatCog）。这解决了ICS的内在问题，例如表示方式居住在无限空间，不同的树结构的句子不能直接比较。我们这样做的方式是使得大部分语法结构可用，与循环卷积等策略相反。使用CatCo模型还使我们能够利用为CatCo开发的工具，例如通过密度矩阵表示歧义和逻辑推理，关系代词等词语的结构含义，以及处理上下延伸，所有这些都是目前在认知过程中。此外，CatCog框架具有足够的灵活性，以允许完全不同的意义表示，如概念空间。有趣的是，由于CatCo模型主要受分类量子力学的启发，CatCog也是如此。
