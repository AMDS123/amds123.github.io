##### Abstract
We refine excitonic parameters of bulk GaN by means of time-of-flight spectroscopy of light pulses propagating through crystals. The influence of elastic photon scattering is excluded by using the multiple reflections of the pulses from crystal boundaries. The shapes of these reflexes in the time-energy plane depict the variation of the group velocity induced by excitonic resonances. Modeling of the shapes, as well as other spectra, shows that a homogeneous width of the order of 10 \mu eV characterizes the exciton-polariton resonances within the crystal. The oscillator strength of A and B exciton-polaritons is determined as 0.0022 and 0.0016, respectively.
