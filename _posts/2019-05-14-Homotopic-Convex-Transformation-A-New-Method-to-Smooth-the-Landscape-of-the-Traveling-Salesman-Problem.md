##### Abstract
This paper proposes a novel landscape smoothing method for the symmetric Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP). We first define the homotopic convex (HC) transformation of a TSP as a convex combination of a well-constructed simple TSP and the original TSP. We observe that controlled by the coefficient of the convex combination, (i) the landscape of the HC transformed TSP is smoothed in terms that its number of local optima is reduced compared to the original TSP; (ii) the fitness distance correlation of the HC transformed TSP is increased. We then propose an iterative algorithmic framework in which the proposed HC transformation is combined with a heuristic TSP solver. It works as an escaping scheme from local optima for improving the global search ability of the combined heuristic. A case study with the 3-Opt local search as the heuristic solver shows that the resultant algorithm significantly outperforms iterated local search and two other smoothing-based TSP heuristic solvers on most of commonly-used test instances.
