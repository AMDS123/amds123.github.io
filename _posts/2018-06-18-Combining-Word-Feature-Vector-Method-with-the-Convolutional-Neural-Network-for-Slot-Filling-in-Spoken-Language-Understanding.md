##### Abstract
Slot filling is an important problem in Spoken Language Understanding (SLU) and Natural Language Processing (NLP), which involves identifying a user's intent and assigning a semantic concept to each word in a sentence. This paper presents a word feature vector method and combines it into the convolutional neural network (CNN). We consider 18 word features and each word feature is constructed by merging similar word labels. By introducing the concept of external library, we propose a feature set approach that is beneficial for building the relationship between a word from the training dataset and the feature. Computational results are reported using the ATIS dataset and comparisons with traditional CNN as well as bi-directional sequential CNN are also presented.

时隙填充是口语语言理解（SLU）和自然语言处理（NLP）中的一个重要问题，它涉及识别用户的意图并为句子中的每个单词分配语义概念。本文提出了一种词特征向量的方法，并将其结合到卷积神经网络（CNN）中。我们考虑18个单词特征，并且通过合并相似的单词标签来构建每个单词特征。通过引入外部图书馆的概念，我们提出了一种特征集方法，有利于建立训练数据集中的单词与特征之间的关系。使用ATIS数据集报告计算结果，并与传统CNN以及双向连续CNN进行比较。
