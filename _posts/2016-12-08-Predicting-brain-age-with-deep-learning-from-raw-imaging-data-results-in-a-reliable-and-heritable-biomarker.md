##### Abstract
Machine learning analysis of neuroimaging data can accurately predict chronological age in healthy people and deviations from healthy brain ageing have been associated with cognitive impairment and disease. Here we sought to further establish the credentials of "brain-predicted age" as a biomarker of individual differences in the brain ageing process, using a predictive modelling approach based on deep learning, and specifically convolutional neural networks (CNN), and applied to both pre-processed and raw T1-weighted MRI data. Firstly, we aimed to demonstrate the accuracy of CNN brain-predicted age using a large dataset of healthy adults (N = 2001). Next, we sought to establish the heritability of brain-predicted age using a sample of monozygotic and dizygotic female twins (N = 62). Thirdly, we examined the test-retest and multi-centre reliability of brain-predicted age using two samples (within-scanner N = 20; between-scanner N = 11). CNN brain-predicted ages were generated and compared to a Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) approach, on all datasets. Input data were grey matter (GM) or white matter (WM) volumetric maps generated by Statistical Parametric Mapping (SPM) or raw data. Brain-predicted age represents an accurate, highly reliable and genetically-valid phenotype, that has potential to be used as a biomarker of brain ageing. Moreover, age predictions can be accurately generated on raw T1-MRI data, substantially reducing computation time for novel data, bringing the process closer to giving real-time information on brain health in clinical settings.

神经影像学数据的机器学习分析可以准确预测健康人的年龄，偏离健康的大脑老化与认知障碍和疾病有关。在这里，我们试图使用基于深度学习的预测建模方法，特别是卷积神经网络（CNN），来进一步建立“脑预测年龄”的凭据作为大脑衰老过程中个体差异的生物标记，预处理和原始T1加权MRI数据。首先，我们旨在使用健康成年人的大型数据集来证明CNN脑部预测年龄的准确性（N = 2001）。接下来，我们试图使用单卵双生和双卵双生的样本（N = 62）建立大脑预测年龄的遗传度。第三，我们使用两个样本（在扫描仪内N = 20;扫描仪间N = 11）检查了脑预测年龄的重测和多中心可靠性。在所有数据集上生成CNN脑预测年龄并与高斯过程回归（GPR）方法进行比较。输入数据是由统计参数映射（SPM）或原始数据生成的灰质（GM）或白质（WM）体积图。大脑预测年龄代表一个准确，高度可靠和遗传有效的表型，有潜力被用作大脑老化的生物标志物。此外，可以在原始T1-MRI数据上准确地生成年龄预测，从而大大减少新数据的计算时间，使得该过程更接近在临床环境中提供关于大脑健康的实时信息。
