##### Abstract
Sparse representation-based classifiers have shown outstanding accuracy and robustness in image classification tasks even with the presence of intense noise and occlusion. However, it has been discovered that the performance degrades significantly either when test image is not aligned with the dictionary atoms or the dictionary atoms themselves are not aligned with each other, in which cases the sparse linear representation assumption fails. In this paper, having both training and test images misaligned, we introduce a novel sparse coding framework that is able to efficiently adapt the dictionary atoms to the test image via large displacement optical flow. In the proposed algorithm, every dictionary atom is automatically aligned with the input image and the sparse code is then recovered using the adapted dictionary atoms. A corresponding supervised dictionary learning algorithm is also developed for the proposed framework. Experimental results on digit datasets recognition verify the efficacy and robustness of the proposed algorithm.

##### Abstract (translated by Google)
即使存在强烈的噪声和遮挡，基于稀疏表示的分类器在图像分类任务中也显示出出色的准确性和鲁棒性。然而，已经发现，当测试图像不与字典原子对齐或者字典原子本身不彼此对齐时，性能显着降低，在这种情况下，稀疏线性表示假设失败。本文将训练图像和测试图像进​​行对位，并引入一种新颖的稀疏编码框架，通过大位移光流有效地将字典原子适配于测试图像。在所提出的算法中，每个字典原子自动与输入图像对齐，然后使用自适应的字典原子恢复稀疏代码。对于所提出的框架，还开发了相应的监督字典学习算法。数字数据集识别的实验结果验证了该算法的有效性和鲁棒性。
