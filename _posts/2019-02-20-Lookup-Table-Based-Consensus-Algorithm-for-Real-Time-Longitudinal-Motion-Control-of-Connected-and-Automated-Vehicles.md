##### Abstract
Connected and automated vehicle (CAV) technology is one of the promising solutions to addressing the safety, mobility and sustainability issues of our current transportation systems. Specifically, the control algorithm plays an important role in a CAV system, since it executes the commands generated by former steps, such as communication, perception, and planning. In this study, we propose a consensus algorithm to control the longitudinal motion of CAVs in real time. Different from previous studies in this field where control gains of the consensus algorithm are pre-determined and fixed, we develop algorithms to build up a lookup table, searching for the ideal control gains with respect to different initial conditions of CAVs in real time. Numerical simulation shows that, the proposed lookup table-based consensus algorithm outperforms the authors' previous work, as well as van Arem's linear feedback-based longitudinal motion control algorithm in all four different scenarios with various initial conditions of CAVs, in terms of convergence time and maximum jerk of the simulation run.
