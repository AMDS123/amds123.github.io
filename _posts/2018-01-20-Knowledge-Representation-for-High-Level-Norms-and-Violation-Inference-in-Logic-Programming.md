##### Abstract
Most of the knowledge Representation formalisms developed for representing prescriptive norms can be categorized as either suitable for representing either low level or high level norms.We argue that low level norm representations do not advance the cause of autonomy in agents in the sense that it is not the agent itself that determines the normative position it should be at a particular time, on the account of a more general rule. In other words an agent on some external system for a nitty gritty prescriptions of its obligations and prohibitions. On the other hand, high level norms which have an explicit description of a norm's precondition and have some form of implication, do not as they exist in the literature do not support generalized inferences about violation like low level norm representations do. This paper presents a logical formalism for the representation of high level norms in open societies that enable violation inferences that detail the situation in which the norm violation took place and the identity of the norm violation. Norms are formalized as logic programs whose heads specify what an agent is obliged or permitted to do when a situation arises and within what time constraint of the situation.Each norm is also assigned an identity using some reification scheme. The body of each logic program describes the nature of the situation in which the agent is expected to act or desist from acting. This kind of violation is novel in the literature.

##### Abstract (translated by Google)
大多数为了表示规范性规范而开发的表示形式主义可以被分类为适合于表示低级规范或高级规范。我们认为，低级规范表示并不推进代理人的自治原因，因为它不是代理人本身决定了它应该在特定时间的规范地位，这是为了更一般的规则。换句话说，一个代理人在某种外部系统中对其义务和禁止行为进行处罚。另一方面，对规范的先决条件有一个明确的描述并具有某种形式的暗示的高层次的规范，并不像文献中所存在的那样，不支持像低层规范表征那样的对于违反的广义的推论。本文提出了一个逻辑的形式主义，用于在开放社会中表达高层次的规范，从而能够进行违规推断，详细说明违反规范的情况以及违反规范的情况。规范被形式化为逻辑程序，其头部规定了当情况发生时以及在情况的时间限制之内，代理人有义务或允许执行的事情。每个规范还使用某种实体化方案来分配身份。每个逻辑程序的正文描述了代理人预期行动或停止行事的情况的性质。这种违规行为在文献中是新颖的。
