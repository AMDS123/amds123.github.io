##### Abstract
Currently, a growing number of health consumers are asking health-related questions online, at any time and from anywhere, which effectively lowers the cost of health care. The most common approach is using online health expert question-answering (HQA) services, as health consumers are more willing to trust answers from professional physicians. However, these answers can be of varying quality depending on circumstance. In addition, as the available HQA services grow, how to predict the answer quality of HQA services via machine learning becomes increasingly important and challenging. In an HQA service, answers are normally short texts, which are severely affected by the data sparsity problem. Furthermore, HQA services lack community features such as best answer and user votes. Therefore, the wisdom of the crowd is not available to rate answer quality. To address these problems, in this paper, the prediction of HQA answer quality is defined as a classification task. First, based on the characteristics of HQA services and feedback from medical experts, a standard for HQA service answer quality evaluation is defined. Next, based on the characteristics of HQA services, several novel non-textual features are proposed, including surface linguistic features and social features. Finally, a deep belief network (DBN)-based HQA answer quality prediction framework is proposed to predict the quality of answers by learning the high-level hidden semantic representation from the physicians' answers. Our results prove that the proposed framework overcomes the problem of overly sparse textual features in short text answers and effectively identifies high-quality answers.

目前，越来越多的健康消费者在网上随时随地询问与健康有关的问题，从而有效降低了医疗成本。最常见的方法是使用在线健康专家问答（HQA）服务，因为健康消费者更愿意相信专业医生的答案。但是，这些答案可以根据情况具有不同的质量。另外，随着可用HQA服务的增长，如何通过机器学习来预测HQA服务的答案质量变得越来越重要和具有挑战性。在HQA服务中，答案通常是短文本，受到数据稀疏性问题的严重影响。此外，HQA服务缺乏最佳答案和用户投票等社区功能。因此，人群的智慧是不可用来评价答案的质量。为了解决这些问题，本文将HQA答案质量的预测定义为分类任务。首先，根据HQA服务的特点和医学专家的反馈，定义了HQA服务质量评估的标准。其次，基于HQA服务的特点，提出了一些新颖的非文本特征，包括表面语言特征和社会特征。最后，提出了一种基于深度信念网络（HNN）的HQA答案质量预测框架，通过从医生的答案中学习高级隐含语义表示来预测答案的质量。我们的结果证明，所提出的框架克服了短文本答案中过于稀疏的文本特征的问题，并有效地识别出高质量的答案。
