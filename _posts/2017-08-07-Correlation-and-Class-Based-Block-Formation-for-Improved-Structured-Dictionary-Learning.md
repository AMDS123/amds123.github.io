##### Abstract
In recent years, the creation of block-structured dictionary has attracted a lot of interest. Learning such dictionaries involve two step process: block formation and dictionary update. Both these steps are important in producing an effective dictionary. The existing works mostly assume that the block structure is known a priori while learning the dictionary. For finding the unknown block structure given a dictionary commonly sparse agglomerative clustering (SAC) is used. It groups atoms based on their consistency in sparse coding with respect to the unstructured dictionary. This paper explores two innovations towards improving the reconstruction as well as the classification ability achieved with the block-structured dictionary. First, we propose a novel block structuring approach that makes use of the correlation among dictionary atoms. Unlike the SAC approach, which groups diverse atoms, in the proposed approach the blocks are formed by grouping the top most correlated atoms in the dictionary. The proposed block clustering approach is noted to yield significant reductions in redundancy as well as provides a direct control on the block size when compared with the existing SAC-based block structuring. Later, motivated by works using supervised \emph{a priori} known block structure, we also explore the incorporation of class information in the proposed block formation approach to further enhance the classification ability of the block dictionary. For assessment of the reconstruction ability with proposed innovations is done on synthetic data while the classification ability has been evaluated in large variability speaker verification task.

近年来，块结构字典的创建吸引了很多人的兴趣。学习这样的字典涉及两个步骤：块形成和字典更新。这两个步骤对于生成有效的字典都很重要。现有的作品主要假定在学习字典的同时，块结构是先验的。为了找到字典中的未知块结构，通常使用稀疏凝聚聚类（SAC）。它根据稀疏编码中的非结构化字典的一致性对原子进行分组。本文探讨了改进重构的两个创新，以及用块结构字典实现的分类能力。首先，我们提出了一种利用字典原子之间的相关性的新颖块结构化方法。不同于SAC方法，它将不同的原子分组，在所提出的方法中，通过将字典中最相关的原子分组来形成块。注意到所提出的块聚类方法产生显着的冗余减少，并且与现有的基于SAC的块结构相比，提供对块尺寸的直接控制。后来，由于使用监督式先验已知块结构的作品，我们还探索了在所提出的块形成方法中引入类信息，以进一步增强块字典的分类能力。为了评估重建能力，利用提出的创新方法对合成数据进行了分类，并在大变量说话人验证任务中评估了分类能力。
