##### Abstract
Radar sensors provide a unique method for executing environmental perception tasks towards autonomous driving. Especially their capability to perform well in adverse weather conditions often makes them superior to other sensors such as cameras or lidar. Nevertheless, the high sparsity and low dimensionality of the commonly used detection data level is a major challenge for subsequent signal processing. Therefore, the data points are often merged in order to form larger entities from which more information can be gathered. The merging process is often implemented in form of a clustering algorithm. This article describes a novel approach for first filtering out static background data before applying a twostage clustering approach. The two-stage clustering follows the same paradigm as the idea for data association itself: First, clustering what is ought to belong together in a low dimensional parameter space, then, extracting additional features from the newly created clusters in order to perform a final clustering step. Parameters are optimized for filtering and both clustering steps. All techniques are assessed both individually and as a whole in order to demonstrate their effectiveness. Final results indicate clear benefits of the first two methods and also the cluster merging process under specific circumstances.
