##### Abstract
The goal of sentence and document modeling is to accurately represent the meaning of sentences and documents for various Natural Language Processing tasks. In this work, we present Dependency Sensitive Convolutional Neural Networks (DSCNN) as a general-purpose classification system for both sentences and documents. DSCNN hierarchically builds textual representations by processing pretrained word embeddings via Long Short-Term Memory networks and subsequently extracting features with convolution operators. Compared with existing recursive neural models with tree structures, DSCNN does not rely on parsers and expensive phrase labeling, and thus is not restricted to sentence-level tasks. Moreover, unlike other CNN-based models that analyze sentences locally by sliding windows, our system captures both the dependency information within each sentence and relationships across sentences in the same document. Experiment results demonstrate that our approach is achieving state-of-the-art performance on several tasks, including sentiment analysis, question type classification, and subjectivity classification.

句子和文档建模的目标是准确地表示各种自然语言处理任务的句子和文档的含义。在这项工作中，我们提出依赖敏感卷积神经网络（DSCNN）作为一个通用的分类系统的句子和文件。 DSCNN通过经由Long Short-Term Memory网络处理预训练词嵌入并随后使用卷积运算符来提取特征来分层建立文本表示。与现有的具有树结构的递归神经模型相比，DSCNN不依赖于解析器和昂贵的词组标注，因此不限于句级任务。而且，与其他基于CNN的模型通过滑动窗口在本地分析句子不同，我们的系统捕获每个句子中的依赖信息和同一文档中句子间的关系。实验结果表明，我们的方法正在实现一些任务，包括情感分析，问题类型分类和主观分类的最先进的表现。
