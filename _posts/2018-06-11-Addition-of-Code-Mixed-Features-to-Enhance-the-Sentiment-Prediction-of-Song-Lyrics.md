##### Abstract
Sentiment analysis, also called opinion mining, is the field of study that analyzes people's opinions,sentiments, attitudes and emotions. Songs are important to sentiment analysis since the songs and mood are mutually dependent on each other. Based on the selected song it becomes easy to find the mood of the listener, in future it can be used for recommendation. The song lyric is a rich source of datasets containing words that are helpful in analysis and classification of sentiments generated from it. Now a days we observe a lot of inter-sentential and intra-sentential code-mixing in songs which has a varying impact on audience. To study this impact we created a Telugu songs dataset which contained both Telugu-English code-mixed and pure Telugu songs. In this paper, we classify the songs based on its arousal as exciting or non-exciting. We develop a language identification tool and introduce code-mixing features obtained from it as additional features. Our system with these additional features attains 4-5% accuracy greater than traditional approaches on our dataset.

情感分析也称为意见挖掘，是分析人们观点，情绪，态度和情绪的研究领域。歌曲对于情感分析很重要，因为歌曲和情绪是相互依赖的。根据所选歌曲，很容易找到听众的心情，将来它可以用于推荐。歌曲歌词是丰富的数据集来源，包含有助于分析和分类由其生成的情感的单词。现在，我们观察了许多对听众具有不同影响的歌曲中的句间和句法间混音。为了研究这种影响，我们创建了一个泰卢固语歌曲数据集，其中包含泰卢固语 - 英语混合编码和纯泰卢古语歌曲。在本文中，我们根据歌曲的兴奋性将歌曲分类为令人兴奋或不激动。我们开发了一种语言识别工具，并将从其中获得的代码混合功能作为附加功能引入。具有这些附加功能的我们的系统比我们的数据集上的传统方法的准确度高4-5％。
