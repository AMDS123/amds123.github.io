##### Abstract
While neural networks have been used extensively to make substantial progress in the machine translation task, they are known for being heavily dependent on the availability of large amounts of training data. Recent efforts have tried to alleviate the data sparsity problem by augmenting the training data using different strategies, such as back-translation. Along with the data scarcity, the out-of-vocabulary words, mostly entities and terminological expressions, pose a difficult challenge to Neural Machine Translation systems. In this paper, we hypothesize that knowledge graphs enhance the semantic feature extraction of neural models, thus optimizing the translation of entities and terminological expressions in texts and consequently leading to a better translation quality. We hence investigate two different strategies for incorporating knowledge graphs into neural models without modifying the neural network architectures. We also examine the effectiveness of our augmentation method to recurrent and non-recurrent (self-attentional) neural architectures. Our knowledge graph augmented neural translation model, dubbed KG-NMT, achieves significant and consistent improvements of +3 BLEU, METEOR and chrF3 on average on the newstest datasets between 2014 and 2018 for WMT English-German translation task.
