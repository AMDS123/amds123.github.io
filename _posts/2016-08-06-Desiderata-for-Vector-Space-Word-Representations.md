##### Abstract
A plethora of vector-space representations for words is currently available, which is growing. These consist of fixed-length vectors containing real values, which represent a word. The result is a representation upon which the power of many conventional information processing and data mining techniques can be brought to bear, as long as the representations are designed with some forethought and fit certain constraints. This paper details desiderata for the design of vector space representations of words.

目前有大量的用于单词的向量空间表示，这种表示正在增长。这些由包含实数值的固定长度的矢量组成，其代表一个字。其结果是一个代表性，许多传统的信息处理和数据挖掘技术的权力可以承担，只要表示的设计有一定的预见和适合一定的限制。本文详细介绍了词的向量空间表示设计的意义。
