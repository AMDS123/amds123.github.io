##### Abstract
The construction quality of the bolt is directly related to the safety of the project. The construction quality of the bolt anchorage must be tested. In this paper, the improved complete ensemble empirical mode decomposition (ICEEMD) method is introduced into the bolt detection signal analysis. The ICEEMD is used to decompose the anchor detection signal according to the approximate entropy of each intrinsic mode function (IMF). The noise of the IMFs is eliminated by the wavelet soft threshold de-noising technique. Based on the approximate entropy and the wavelet de-noising principle, the ICEEMD-De anchor signal analysis method is proposed. From the analysis of the vibration analog signal, as well as the bolt detection signal, the result shows that the ICEEMD-De method is able to correctly separate the different IMFs under the noisy condition, and the IMF can effectively identify the reflection signal of the end of the bolt.

螺栓的施工质量直接关系到项目的安全。锚栓的施工质量必须经过检验。本文将改进的完全集合经验模式分解（ICEEMD）方法引入到螺栓检测信号分析中。 ICEEMD用于根据每个固有模式函数（IMF）的近似熵分解锚检测信号。基于小波软阈值去噪技术消除了IMFs的噪声。基于近似熵和小波去噪原理，提出了ICEEMD-De锚信号分析方法。通过对振动模拟信号的分析以及螺栓检测信号的分析，结果表明，ICEEMD-De方法能够在噪声条件下正确分离不同的IMF，IMF能有效地识别螺栓的末端。
