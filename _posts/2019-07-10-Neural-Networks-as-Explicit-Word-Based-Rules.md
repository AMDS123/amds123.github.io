##### Abstract
Filters of convolutional networks used in computer vision are often visualized as image patches that maximize the response of the filter. We use the same approach to interpret weight matrices in simple architectures for natural language processing tasks. We interpret a convolutional network for sentiment classification as word-based rules. Using the rule, we recover the performance of the original model.
