##### Abstract
Dynamic magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) exhibits high correlations in k-space and time. In order to accelerate the dynamic MR imaging and to exploit k-t correlations from highly undersampled data, here we propose a novel deep learning based approach for dynamic MR image reconstruction, termed k-t NEXT (k-t NEtwork with X-f Transform). In particular, inspired by traditional methods such as k-t BLAST and k-t FOCUSS, we propose to reconstruct the true signals from aliased signals in x-f domain to exploit the spatio-temporal redundancies. Building on that, the proposed method then learns to recover the signals by alternating the reconstruction process between the x-f space and image space in an iterative fashion. This enables the network to effectively capture useful information and jointly exploit spatio-temporal correlations from both complementary domains. Experiments conducted on highly undersampled short-axis cardiac cine MRI scans demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms the current state-of-the-art dynamic MR reconstruction approaches both quantitatively and qualitatively.
