##### Abstract
The ability to classify spoken speech based on the style of speaking is an important problem. With the advent of BPO's in recent times, specifically those that cater to a population other than the local population, it has become necessary for BPO's to identify people with certain style of speaking (American, British etc). Today BPO's employ accent analysts to identify people having the required style of speaking. This process while involving human bias, it is becoming increasingly infeasible because of the high attrition rate in the BPO industry. In this paper, we propose a new metric, which robustly and accurately helps classify spoken speech based on the style of speaking. The role of the proposed metric is substantiated by using it to classify real speech data collected from over seventy different people working in a BPO. We compare the performance of the metric against human experts who independently carried out the classification process. Experimental results show that the performance of the system using the novel metric performs better than two different human expert.

根据说话方式对口语进行分类的能力是一个重要的问题。随着最近BPO的出现，特别是那些迎合当地人口以外的人群，BPO有必要识别具有某种风格的人（美国人，英国人等）。今天，BPO雇用口音分析师来识别具有所需说话风格的人。这个过程虽然涉及到人的偏见，但由于BPO行业的高流失率，这个过程变得越来越不可行。在本文中，我们提出了一种新的度量方法，该方法能够准确有效地根据说话风格对口语进行分类。所提出的指标的作用通过使用它来分类从在BPO中工作的七十多个不同人员收集的真实语音数据来证实。我们将该度量的性能与独立执行分类过程的人类专家进行比较。实验结果表明，使用新颖度量的系统性能优于两个不同的人类专家。
