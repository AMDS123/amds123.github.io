##### Abstract
HITS adapted algorithm for synonym search, the program architecture, and the program work evaluation with test examples are presented in the paper. Synarcher program for synonym (and related terms) search in the text corpus of special structure (Wikipedia) was developed. The results of search are presented in the form of a graph. It is possible to explore the graph and search graph elements interactively. The proposed algorithm could be applied to the search request extending and for synonym dictionary forming.
