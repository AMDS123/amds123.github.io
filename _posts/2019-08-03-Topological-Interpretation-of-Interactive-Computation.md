##### Abstract
It is a great pleasure to write this tribute in honor of Scott A. Smolka on his 65th birthday. We revisit Goldin, Smolka hypothesis that persistent Turing machine (PTM) can capture the intuitive notion of sequential interaction computation. We propose a topological setting to model the abstract concept of environment. We use it to define a notion of a topological Turing machine (TTM) as a universal model for interactive computation and possible model for concurrent computation.
