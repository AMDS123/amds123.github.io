##### Abstract
Major advances have recently been made in merging language and vision representations. But most tasks considered so far have confined themselves to the processing of objects and lexicalised relations amongst objects (content words). We know, however, that humans (even pre-school children) can abstract over raw data to perform certain types of higher-level reasoning, expressed in natural language by function words. A case in point is given by their ability to learn quantifiers, i.e. expressions like 'few', 'some' and 'all'. From formal semantics and cognitive linguistics, we know that quantifiers are relations over sets which, as a simplification, we can see as proportions. For instance, in 'most fish are red', most encodes the proportion of fish which are red fish. In this paper, we study how well current language and vision strategies model such relations. We show that state-of-the-art attention mechanisms coupled with a traditional linguistic formalisation of quantifiers gives best performance on the task. Additionally, we provide insights on the role of 'gist' representations in quantification. A 'logical' strategy to tackle the task would be to first obtain a numerosity estimation for the two involved sets and then compare their cardinalities. We however argue that precisely identifying the composition of the sets is not only beyond current state-of-the-art models but perhaps even detrimental to a task that is most efficiently performed by refining the approximate numerosity estimator of the system.

最近在合并语言和视觉表示方面取得了重大进展。但是到目前为止，大多数的任务都只局限于对象的处理和对象之间的词汇化关系（内容词）。然而，我们知道，人类（甚至是学龄前儿童）可以抽取原始数据来执行某些类型的高级推理，用自然语言用函数词表示。一个恰当的例子是他们学习量词的能力，即像“少”，“一些”和“全部”这样的表达。从形式语义学和认知语言学，我们知道量词是关于集合的关系，作为一个简化，我们可以看到比例。例如，在“大多数鱼是红色的”中，大多数是编码红色鱼的鱼的比例。在本文中，我们研究目前的语言和视觉策略如何建模这种关系。我们表明，最先进的注意机制，加上量词的传统语言形式化，在任务上表现最好。此外，我们提供了“量化”中的“要点”表示的作用的见解。解决这个任务的“逻辑”策略是首先获得两个相关集合的数量估计，然后比较它们的基数。然而，我们认为精确地确定集合的组成不仅超出当前最先进的模型，而且可能甚至不利于通过改进系统的近似数量估计器而最有效地执行的任务。
