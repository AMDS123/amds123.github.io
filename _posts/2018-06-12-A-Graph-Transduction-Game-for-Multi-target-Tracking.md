##### Abstract
Semi-supervised learning is a popular class of techniques to learn from labelled and unlabelled data, especially methods based on graph transduction are widely used. This papers proposes an application of a recently proposed approach of graph transduction that exploits game theoretic notions, to the problem of multiple people tracking. Within the proposed framework, targets are considered as players of a multi-player non-cooperative game. The equilibria of the game is considered as a consistent labelling solution and thus a estimation of the target association in the sequence of frames. People patches are extracted from the video frames using a HOG based detector and their similarity is modelled using distances among their covariance matrices. The solution we propose is effective on video surveillance datasets are achieves satisfactory results. The experiments show the robustness of the method even with a heavy unbalance between the number of labelled and unlabelled input patches.

半监督学习是一种流行的从标记和未标记数据中学习的技术，特别是基于图转换的方法被广泛使用。本文提出了一种最近提出的图转换方法的应用，该方法利用博弈理论概念解决多人跟踪问题。在提出的框架内，目标被视为多人非合作博弈的参与者。游戏的均衡被认为是一致的标签解决方案，因此可以估计帧序列中的目标关联。使用基于HOG的检测器从视频帧中提取人物补丁，并使用它们的协方差矩阵之间的距离来对它们的相似度建模。我们提出的解决方案对视频监控数据集有效，取得了令人满意的结果。实验显示了该方法的鲁棒性，即使在标记和未标记输入斑块的数量之间严重不平衡的情况下。
