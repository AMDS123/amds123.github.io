##### Abstract
Animals have evolved to restrict their sensing capabilities to certain region of electromagnetic spectrum. This is surprisingly a very narrow band on a vast scale which makes one think if there is a systematic bias underlying such selective filtration. The situation becomes even more intriguing when we find a sharp cutoff point at Near-infrared point whereby almost all animal vision systems seem to have a lower bound. This brings us to an interesting question: did evolution "intentionally" performed such a restriction in order to evolve higher visual cognition? In this work this question is addressed by experimenting with Near-infrared images for their potential applicability in higher visual processing such as semantic segmentation. A modified version of Fully Convolutional Networks are trained on NIR images and RGB images respectively and compared for their respective effectiveness in the wake of semantic segmentation. The results from the experiments show that visible part of the spectrum alone is sufficient for the robust semantic segmentation of the indoor as well as outdoor scenes.

动物已经发展到将其传感能力限制在电磁频谱的某个区域。令人惊讶的是，这是一个非常窄的范围，使得人们认为如果存在这种选择性过滤的系统性偏见。当我们在近红外点处发现一个尖锐的截止点时，情况变得更加有趣，几乎所有的动物视觉系统似乎都有一个下界。这给我们带来了一个有趣的问题：进化“故意”进行了这种限制，以进化更高的视觉认知？在这项工作中，通过对近红外图像进行实验来解决这个问题，因为它们在较高的视觉处理（如语义分割）中具有潜在的适用性。完全卷积网络的修改版本分别在NIR图像和RGB图像上进行训练，并且在语义分割之后比较它们各自的有效性。实验结果表明，只有光谱的可见部分足以用于室内和室外场景的强健语义分割。
