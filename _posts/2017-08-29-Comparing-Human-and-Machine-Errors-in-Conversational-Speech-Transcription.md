##### Abstract
Recent work in automatic recognition of conversational telephone speech (CTS) has achieved accuracy levels comparable to human transcribers, although there is some debate how to precisely quantify human performance on this task, using the NIST 2000 CTS evaluation set. This raises the question what systematic differences, if any, may be found differentiating human from machine transcription errors. In this paper we approach this question by comparing the output of our most accurate CTS recognition system to that of a standard speech transcription vendor pipeline. We find that the most frequent substitution, deletion and insertion error types of both outputs show a high degree of overlap. The only notable exception is that the automatic recognizer tends to confuse filled pauses ("uh") and backchannel acknowledgments ("uhhuh"). Humans tend not to make this error, presumably due to the distinctive and opposing pragmatic functions attached to these words. Furthermore, we quantify the correlation between human and machine errors at the speaker level, and investigate the effect of speaker overlap between training and test data. Finally, we report on an informal "Turing test" asking humans to discriminate between automatic and human transcription error cases.

最近有关会话电话语音（CTS）自动识别的工作已经达到了与人类转录程序相当的准确性水平，尽管如何使用NIST 2000 CTS评估集精确地量化人类在这项任务上的表现方面存在一些争议。这就产生了一个问题，即如果有的话，可能会发现系统性差异，从而将人类与机器抄写错误区分开来。在本文中，我们通过比较我们最精确的CTS识别系统的输出与标准语音转录供应商管线的输出来处理这个问题。我们发现两个输出的最频繁的替换，删除和插入错误类型显示出高度的重叠。唯一值得注意的例外是自动识别器倾向于将填充暂停（“uh”）和反向通道确认（“uhhuh”）混淆。人类往往不会犯这个错误，大概是由于这些词的独特和相反的语用功能。此外，我们量化在讲话人级别的人与机器之间的错误的相关性，并调查培训和测试数据之间的说话人重叠的影响。最后，我们报告一个非正式的“图灵测试”，要求人们区分自动和人为转录错误的情况。
