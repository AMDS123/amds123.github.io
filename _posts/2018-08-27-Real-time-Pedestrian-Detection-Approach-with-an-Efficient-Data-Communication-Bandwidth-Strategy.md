##### Abstract
Vehicle-to-Pedestrian (V2P) communication can significantly improve pedestrian safety at a signalized intersection. It is unlikely that pedestrians will carry a low latency communication enabled device and activate a pedestrian safety application in their hand-held device all the time. Because of this limitation, multiple traffic cameras at the signalized intersection can be used to accurately detect and locate pedestrians using deep learning and broadcast safety alerts related to pedestrians to warn connected vehicles around a signalized intersection. However, unavailability of high-performance computing infrastructure at the roadside and limited network bandwidth between traffic cameras and the computing infrastructure limits the ability of real-time data streaming and processing for pedestrian detection. In this paper, we developed an edge computing based real-time pedestrian detection strategy combining pedestrian detection algorithm using deep learning and an efficient data communication approach to reduce bandwidth requirements while maintaining a high object detection accuracy. We utilized a lossy traffic camera data compression technique to determine the tradeoff between the reduction of the communication bandwidth requirements and a defined object detection accuracy. The performance of the pedestrian-detection strategy is measured in terms of pedestrian classification accuracy with varying peak signal-to-noise ratios. The analyses reveal that we detect pedestrians by maintaining a defined detection accuracy with a peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) 43 dB while reducing the communication bandwidth from 9.82 Mbits/sec to 0.31 Mbits/sec.

车对行人（V2P）通信可以显着改善信号交叉口的行人安全。行人不太可能携带低延迟通信设备并始终在其手持设备中激活行人安全应用程序。由于这种限制，信号交叉口处的多个交通摄像机可用于使用与行人相关的深度学习和广播安全警报来准确地检测和定位行人，以警告信号交叉口周围的连接车辆。然而，路边的高性能计算基础设施不可用以及交通摄像机和计算基础设施之间的有限网络带宽限制了行人检测的实时数据流和处理能力。在本文中，我们开发了一种基于边缘计算的实时行人检测策略，该算法结合了使用深度学习的行人检测算法和有效的数据通信方法，以在保持高物体检测精度的同时降低带宽需求。我们利用有损交通摄像机数据压缩技术来确定降低通信带宽要求和定义的物体检测精度之间的权衡。行人检测策略的性能是根据行人分类精度和不同的峰值信噪比来衡量的。分析表明，我们通过保持定义的检测精度来检测行人，峰值信噪比（PSNR）为43 dB，同时将通信带宽从9.82 Mbits / sec降低到0.31 Mbits / sec。
