##### Abstract
In recent years, image forensics has attracted more and more attention, and many forensic methods have been proposed for identifying image processing operations. Up to now, most existing methods are based on hand crafted features, and just one specific operation is considered in their methods. In many forensic scenarios, however, multiple classification for various image processing operations is more practical. Besides, it is difficult to obtain effective features by hand for some image processing operations. In this paper, therefore, we propose a new convolutional neural network (CNN) based method to adaptively learn discriminative features for identifying typical image processing operations. We carefully design the high pass filter bank to get the image residuals of the input image, the channel expansion layer to mix up the resulting residuals, the pooling layers, and the activation functions employed in our method. The extensive results show that the proposed method can outperform the currently best method based on hand crafted features and three related methods based on CNN for image steganalysis and/or forensics, achieving the state-of-the-art results. Furthermore, we provide more supplementary results to show the rationality and robustness of the proposed model.

近年来，图像取证技术受到越来越多的关注，并提出了许多鉴别图像处理操作的取证方法。到目前为止，大多数现有的方法都是基于手工制作的功能，而在他们的方法中只考虑了一个特定的操作。然而，在许多法庭情景中，对于各种图像处理操作的多重分类更实际。另外，对于一些图像处理操作，手工获取有效的特征是困难的。因此，本文提出了一种基于卷积神经网络（CNN）的自适应学习识别典型图像处理操作识别特征的方法。我们仔细设计了高通滤波器组，以获得输入图像的图像残差，通道扩展层混合了我们方法中使用的残差，合并层和激活函数。广泛的研究结果表明，该方法可以超越目前最好的基于手工特征的方法和基于CNN的三种相关方法进行图像隐写分析和/或取证，达到了最新的结果。此外，我们提供了更多的补充结果，以显示该模型的合理性和鲁棒性。
