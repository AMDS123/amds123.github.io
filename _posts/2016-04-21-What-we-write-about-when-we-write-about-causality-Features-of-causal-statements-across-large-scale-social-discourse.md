##### Abstract
Identifying and communicating relationships between causes and effects is important for understanding our world, but is affected by language structure, cognitive and emotional biases, and the properties of the communication medium. Despite the increasing importance of social media, much remains unknown about causal statements made online. To study real-world causal attribution, we extract a large-scale corpus of causal statements made on the Twitter social network platform as well as a comparable random control corpus. We compare causal and control statements using statistical language and sentiment analysis tools. We find that causal statements have a number of significant lexical and grammatical differences compared with controls and tend to be more negative in sentiment than controls. Causal statements made online tend to focus on news and current events, medicine and health, or interpersonal relationships, as shown by topic models. By quantifying the features and potential biases of causality communication, this study improves our understanding of the accuracy of information and opinions found online.

识别和沟通因果关系对理解我们的世界非常重要，但却受到语言结构，认知和情感偏见以及传播媒介性质的影响。尽管社交媒体的重要性日益增加，但对于网上发表的因果陈述却一无所知。为了研究真实的因果归因，我们提取了一个在Twitter社交网络平台上做出的大规模的因果陈述语料库以及一个可比的随机控制语料库。我们使用统计语言和情感分析工具比较因果和控制语句。我们发现，与对照相比，因果陈述在词汇和语法上存在一些显着的差异，并且在情绪方面往往比对照更消极。由主题模型显示，网上的因果陈述倾向于关注新闻和时事，医药与健康或人际关系。通过量化因果沟通的特征和潜在偏差，本研究提高了我们对网上信息和意见准确性的理解。
