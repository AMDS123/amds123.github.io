##### Abstract
The ability to automatically detect other vehicles on the road is vital to the safety of partially-autonomous and fully-autonomous vehicles. Most of the high-accuracy techniques for this task are based on R-CNN or one of its faster variants. In the research community, much emphasis has been applied to using 3D vision or complex R-CNN variants to achieve higher accuracy. However, are there more straightforward modifications that could deliver higher accuracy? Yes. We show that increasing input image resolution (i.e. upsampling) offers up to 12 percentage-points higher accuracy compared to an off-the-shelf baseline. We also find situations where earlier/shallower layers of CNN provide higher accuracy than later/deeper layers. We further show that shallow models and upsampled images yield competitive accuracy. Our findings contrast with the current trend towards deeper and larger models to achieve high accuracy in domain specific detection tasks.

在道路上自动检测其他车辆的能力对于部分自主和全自动车辆的安全至关重要。这项任务的大多数高精度技术都是基于R-CNN或其更快的变体之一。在研究界中，应用3D视觉或者复杂的R-CNN变体来实现更高的精确度已经得到了很多重视。但是，是否有更直接的修改可以提供更高的准确性？是。我们显示，与现成基准相比，增加输入图像分辨率（即上采样）可提供高达12个百分点的准确度。我们还发现，较早/较浅的CNN层比较晚/较深的层提供更高的精度。我们进一步表明，浅模型和上采样图像产生竞争力的准确性。我们的发现与目前的趋势是越来越大的模型，以实现领域特定检测任务的高准确度。
