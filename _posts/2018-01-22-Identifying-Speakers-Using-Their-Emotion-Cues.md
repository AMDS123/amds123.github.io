##### Abstract
This paper addresses the formulation of a new speaker identification approach which employs knowledge of emotional content of speaker information. Our proposed approach in this work is based on a two-stage recognizer that combines and integrates both emotion recognizer and speaker recognizer into one recognizer. The proposed approach employs both Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) and Suprasegmental Hidden Markov Models (SPHMMs) as classifiers. In the experiments, six emotions are considered including neutral, angry, sad, happy, disgust and fear. Our results show that average speaker identification performance based on the proposed two-stage recognizer is 79.92% with a significant improvement over a one-stage recognizer with an identification performance of 71.58%. The results obtained based on the proposed approach are close to those achieved in subjective evaluation by human listeners.

本文提出了一种新的说话人识别方法，利用说话人信息情感内容的知识。我们在这项工作中提出的方法是基于一个两阶段识别器，结合并集成了情感识别器和说话人识别器到一个识别器。该方法采用隐马尔可夫模型（HMM）和超切分隐马尔可夫模型（SPHMM）作为分类器。在实验中，六种情绪被认为包括中性，愤怒，悲伤，快乐，厌恶和恐惧。我们的研究结果表明，基于所提出的两阶段识别器的平均说话人识别性能为79.92％，比一阶段识别器具有显着改善，识别性能为71.58％。基于所提出的方法得到的结果与人类听众主观评价的结果接近。
