##### Abstract
Deep Neural Networks are built to generalize outside of training set in mind by using techniques such as regularization, early stopping and dropout. But considerations to make them more resilient to adversarial examples are rarely taken. As deep neural networks become more prevalent in mission-critical and real-time systems, miscreants start to attack them by intentionally making deep neural networks to misclassify an object of one type to be seen as another type. This can be catastrophic in some scenarios where the classification of a deep neural network can lead to a fatal decision by a machine. In this work, we used GTSRB dataset to craft adversarial samples by Fast Gradient Sign Method and Jacobian Saliency Method, used those crafted adversarial samples to attack another Deep Convolutional Neural Network and built the attacked network to be more resilient against adversarial attacks by making it more robust by Defensive Distillation and Adversarial Training

深度神经网络是通过使用诸如正则化，提前停止和退出等技术来构建的，以在训练集之外进行概括。但是很少考虑使它们更能适应敌对的例子。随着深度神经网络在关键任务和实时系统中变得越来越普遍，歹徒开始攻击它们，故意使深层神经网络将一种类型的对象误认为另一种类型。在深度神经网络的分类可能导致机器致命的决定的一些情况下，这可能是灾难性的。在这项工作中，我们使用GTSRB数据集通过快速梯度符号法和雅可比特亲和法（Jacobian Saliency Method）来制作敌对样本，使用这些精心设计的对抗样本来攻击另一个深度卷积神经网络，并通过使攻击网络更加灵活，防御性蒸馏和敌对训练强大
