##### Abstract
We present an approach to neural machine translation (NMT) that supports multiple domains in a single model and allows switching between the domains when translating. The core idea is to treat text domains as distinct languages and use multilingual NMT methods to create multi-domain translation systems, we show that this approach results in significant translation quality gains over fine-tuning. We also explore whether the knowledge of pre-specified text domains is necessary, turns out that it is after all, but also that when it is not known quite high translation quality can be reached.
