##### Abstract
Classifying and counting vehicles in road traffic has numerous applications in the transportation engineering domain. However, the wide variety of vehicles (two-wheelers, three-wheelers, cars, buses, trucks etc.) plying on roads of developing regions without any lane discipline, makes vehicle classification and counting a hard problem to automate. In this paper, we use state of the art Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based object detection models and train them for multiple vehicle classes using data from Delhi roads. We get upto 75% MAP on an 80-20 train-test split using 5562 video frames from four different locations. As robust network connectivity is scarce in developing regions for continuous video transmissions from the road to cloud servers, we also evaluate the latency, energy and hardware cost of embedded implementations of our CNN model based inferences.
