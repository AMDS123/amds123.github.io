##### Abstract
Predicting trajectories of pedestrians is quintessential for autonomous robots which share the same environment with humans. In order to effectively and safely interact with humans, trajectory prediction needs to be both precise and computationally efficient. In this work, we propose a convolutional neural network (CNN) based human trajectory prediction approach. Unlike more recent LSTM-based moles which attend sequentially to each frame, our model supports increased parallelism and effective temporal representation. The proposed compact CNN model is faster than the current approaches yet still yields competitive results.
