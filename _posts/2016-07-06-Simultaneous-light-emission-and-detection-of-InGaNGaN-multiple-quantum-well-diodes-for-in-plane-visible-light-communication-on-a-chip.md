##### Abstract
This paper presents the design, fabrication, and experimental characterization of monolithically integrated p-n junction InGaN/GaN multiple quantum well diodes (MQWDs) and suspended waveguides. Suspended MQWDs can be used as transmitters and receivers simultaneously, and suspended waveguides are used for light coupling to create an in-plane visible light communication system. Compared to the waveguide with separation trench, the calculated total light efficiency is increased from 18% to 22% for the continuous waveguide. The MQWDs are characterized by their typical current-voltage performance, and the pulse excitation measurements confirm that the InGaN/GaN MQWDs can achieve the light emission and photodetection at the same time. The photocurrent measurements indicate that the photocurrent is modulated by a bias voltage and that the photons are being supplied from another transmitter. An experimental demonstration is presented showing that the proposed device works well for in-plane full-duplex communication using visible light.

本文介绍了单片集成p-n结InGaN / GaN多量子阱二极管（MQWDs）和悬浮波导的设计，制造和实验特性。暂停的MQWD可以同时用作发射器和接收器，并且悬挂波导用于光耦合以创建面内可见光通信系统。与具有分离槽的波导相比，对于连续波导，计算的总光效率从18％增加到22％。 MQWD具有典型的电流 - 电压性能，脉冲激励测量证实InGaN / GaN MQWDs可以同时实现发光和光电探测。光电流测量表明光电流由偏置电压调制，并且光子由另一个发射器提供。提出了一个实验演示，表明所提出的设备适用于使用可见光的面内全双工通信。
