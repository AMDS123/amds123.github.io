##### Abstract
Object detection and classification for aircraft are the most important tasks in the satellite image analysis. The success of modern detection and classification methods has been based on machine learning and deep learning. One of the key requirements for those learning processes is huge data to train. However, there is an insufficient portion of aircraft since the targets are on military action and oper- ation. Considering the characteristics of satellite imagery, this paper attempts to provide a framework of the simulated and unsupervised methodology without any additional su- pervision or physical assumptions. Finally, the qualitative and quantitative analysis revealed a potential to replenish insufficient data for machine learning platform for satellite image analysis.

飞机的目标检测和分类是卫星图像分析中最重要的任务。现代检测和分类方法的成功基于机器学习和深度学习。这些学习过程的关键要求之一是需要训练的庞大数据。然而，由于目标是军事行动和作战，因此飞机的部分飞机数量不足。考虑到卫星图像的特点，本文试图提供一个模拟和无监督方法的框架，没有任何额外的监督或物理假设。最后，定性和定量分析揭示了为机器学习平台补充卫星图像分析数据不足的潜力。
