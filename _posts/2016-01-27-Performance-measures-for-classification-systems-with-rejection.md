##### Abstract
Classifiers with rejection are essential in real-world applications where misclassifications and their effects are critical. However, if no problem specific cost function is defined, there are no established measures to assess the performance of such classifiers. We introduce a set of desired properties for performance measures for classifiers with rejection, based on which we propose a set of three performance measures for the evaluation of the performance of classifiers with rejection that satisfy the desired properties. The nonrejected accuracy measures the ability of the classifier to accurately classify nonrejected samples; the classification quality measures the correct decision making of the classifier with rejector; and the rejection quality measures the ability to concentrate all misclassified samples onto the set of rejected samples. From the measures, we derive the concept of relative optimality that allows us to connect the measures to a family of cost functions that take into account the trade-off between rejection and misclassification. We illustrate the use of the proposed performance measures on classifiers with rejection applied to synthetic and real-world data.

拒收分类器在错误分类及其影响至关重要的现实应用中至关重要。但是，如果没有定义具体的成本函数问题，就没有建立评估这些分类器性能的措施。我们引入了一组理想的属性，用于拒绝分类器的性能度量，基于此我们提出了一组三个性能指标，用于评估具有满足期望属性的拒绝分类器的性能。未被拒绝的准确度衡量分类器准确分类未被拒绝的样本的能力;分类质量用分离器测量分类器的正确决策;拒收质量测量的是将所有错误分类的样本集中到拒绝样本集的能力。从这些措施中，我们推导出了相对最优性的概念，使我们能够将这些措施与考虑到拒绝和错误分类之间的折中考虑的成本函数族联系起来。我们举例说明了所提出的性能测量方法在分类器中的应用，这些分类器被应用于合成和现实世界的数据。
