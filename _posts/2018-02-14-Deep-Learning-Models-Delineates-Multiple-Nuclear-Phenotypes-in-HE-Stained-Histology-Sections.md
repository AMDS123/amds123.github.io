##### Abstract
Nuclear segmentation is an important step for profiling aberrant regions of histology sections. However, segmentation is a complex problem as a result of variations in nuclear geometry (e.g., size, shape), nuclear type (e.g., epithelial, fibroblast), and nuclear phenotypes (e.g., vesicular, aneuploidy). The problem is further complicated as a result of variations in sample preparation. It is shown and validated that fusion of very deep convolutional networks overcomes (i) complexities associated with multiple nuclear phenotypes, and (ii) separation of overlapping nuclei. The fusion relies on integrating of networks that learn region- and boundary-based representations. The system has been validated on a diverse set of nuclear phenotypes that correspond to the breast and brain histology sections.

核分割是分析组织学异常区域的重要步骤。然而，由于核几何形状（例如大小，形状），核类型（例如上皮，成纤维细胞）和核表型（例如囊状，非整倍性）的变化，分割是一个复杂的问题。由于样品制备的差异导致问题更加复杂。已经证明和证实，非常深的卷积网络的融合克服了（i）与多个核表型相关的复杂性，和（ii）重叠核的分离。融合依赖于学习基于区域和边界的表示的网络的整合。该系统已经验证了对应于乳房和脑组织学部分的多种核表型。
