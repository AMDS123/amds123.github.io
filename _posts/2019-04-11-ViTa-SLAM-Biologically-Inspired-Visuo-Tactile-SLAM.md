##### Abstract
In this work, we propose a novel, bio-inspired multi-sensory SLAM approach called ViTa-SLAM. Compared to other multisensory SLAM variants, this approach allows for a seamless multi-sensory information fusion whilst naturally interacting with the environment. The algorithm is empirically evaluated in a simulated setting using a biomimetic robot platform called the WhiskEye. Our results show promising performance enhancements over existing bio-inspired SLAM approaches in terms of loop-closure detection.
