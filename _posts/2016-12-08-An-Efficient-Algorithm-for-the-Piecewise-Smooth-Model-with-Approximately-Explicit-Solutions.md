##### Abstract
This paper presents an efficient approach to image segmentation that approximates the piecewise-smooth (PS) functional in [12] with explicit solutions. By rendering some rational constraints on the initial conditions and the final solutions of the PS functional, we propose two novel formulations which can be approximated to be the explicit solutions of the evolution partial differential equations (PDEs) of the PS model, in which only one PDE needs to be solved efficiently. Furthermore, an energy term that regularizes the level set function to be a signed distance function is incorporated into our evolution formulation, and the time-consuming re-initialization is avoided. Experiments on synthetic and real images show that our method is more efficient than both the PS model and the local binary fitting (LBF) model [4], while having similar segmentation accuracy as the LBF model.

本文提出了一种有效的图像分割方法，用[12]显式解近似分段平滑（PS）的功能。通过对PS函数的初始条件和最终解进行一些合理的约束，我们提出了两个新的公式，它们可以近似为PS模型的演化偏微分方程（PDEs）的显式解，其中只有一个PDE需要被有效地解决。此外，将水平集函数正则化为符号距离函数的能量项被纳入我们的演化公式中，避免了耗时的重新初始化。在合成和实际图像上的实验表明，我们的方法比PS模型和局部二进制拟合（LBF）模型更有效，而具有与LBF模型相似的分割精度。
