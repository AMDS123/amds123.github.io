##### Abstract
Food image recognition is one of the promising applications of visual object recognition in computer vision. In this study, a small-scale dataset consisting of 5822 images of ten categories and a five-layer CNN was constructed to recognize these images. The bag-of-features (BoF) model coupled with support vector machine was first tested as comparison, resulting in an overall accuracy of 56%, while the CNN performed much better with an overall accuracy of 74%. Data expansion techniques were applied to increase the size of training images, which achieved a significantly improved accuracy of more than 90% and prevent the overfitting issue that occurred to the CNN without using data expansion. Further improvement is within reach by collecting more images and optimizing the network architecture and relevant hyper-parameters.

食品图像识别是视觉对象识别在计算机视觉领域的一个有前景的应用领域。在这项研究中，一个由10个类别的5822个图像和一个五层CNN组成的小规模数据集被构建来识别这些图像。首先测试了与支持向量机相结合的特征包（BoF）模型作为比较，结果总体精度为56％，而CNN表现更好，总体精度为74％。采用数据扩展技术来增加训练图像的大小，实现了90％以上的准确率的显着提高，并且避免了CNN出现的过度拟合问题而没有使用数据扩展。通过收集更多的图像和优化网络架构和相关的超参数，可以进一步改进。
