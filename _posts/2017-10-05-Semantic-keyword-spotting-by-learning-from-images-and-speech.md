##### Abstract
We consider the problem of representing semantic concepts in speech by learning from untranscribed speech paired with images of scenes. This setting is relevant in low-resource speech processing, robotics, and human language acquisition research. We use an external image tagger to generate soft labels, which serve as targets for training a neural model that maps speech to keyword labels. We introduce a newly collected data set of human semantic relevance judgements and an associated task, semantic keyword spotting, where the goal is to search for spoken utterances that are semantically relevant to a given text query. Without seeing any text, the model trained on parallel speech and images achieves a precision of almost 60% on its top ten semantic retrievals. Compared to a model trained on transcriptions, our model matches human judgements better by some measures, especially in retrieving non-verbatim semantic matches.

我们考虑通过从与场景图像配对的非转录语音中学习来表达语义概念的问题。这个设置与低资源语音处理，机器人和人类语言习得研究有关。我们使用一个外部图像标记器来生成软标签，作为训练一个神经模型的目标，将语音映射到关键字标签。我们引入一个新收集的人类语义相关性判断和相关任务的数据集，即语义关键词定位，其目标是搜索与给定文本查询语义相关的口头语音。在没有看到任何文本的情况下，对平行语音和图像进行训练的模型在其十大语义检索中达到近60％的精确度。与模仿训练模式相比，我们的模型通过一些措施更好地匹配人的判断，特别是在检索非逐字语义匹配时。
