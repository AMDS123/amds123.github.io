##### Abstract
Zero-shot sketch-based image retrieval (ZS-SBIR) is a specific cross-modal retrieval task for retrieving natural images with free-hand sketches under zero-shot scenario. Previous works mostly focus on modeling the correspondence between images and sketches or synthesizing image features with sketch features. However, both of them ignore the large intra-class variance of sketches, thus resulting in unsatisfactory retrieval performance. In this paper, we propose a novel end-to-end semantic adversarial approach for ZS-SBIR. Specifically, we devise a semantic adversarial module to maximize the consistency between learned semantic features and category-level word vectors. Moreover, to preserve the discriminability of synthesized features within each training category, a triplet loss is employed for the generative module. Additionally, the proposed model is trained in an end-to-end strategy to exploit better semantic features suitable for ZS-SBIR. Extensive experiments conducted on two large-scale popular datasets demonstrate that our proposed approach remarkably outperforms state-of-the-art approaches by more than 12\% on Sketchy dataset and about 3\% on TU-Berlin dataset in the retrieval.
