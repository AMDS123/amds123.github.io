##### Abstract
The primary goal of this work is to review the importance of data compression and present a fast Fourier-based method for generating the deterministic compression matrix in the area of deterministic compressed sensing. The principle concepts of data compression such as general process of data compression, sparse signals, coherence matrix and Restricted Isometry Property (RIP) have been defined. We have introduced two methods of sparse data compression. The first method is formed by utilizing a stochastic matrix which is a common approach, and the second method is created by utilizing a deterministic matrix which is proposed more recently. The main goal of this work is to improve the execution time of the deterministic matrix generation. The execution time is related to the generation method of the deterministic matrix. Furthermore, we have implemented a software which makes it possible to compare different methods of reconstructing data compression. To make this comparison, it is necessary to draw and compare certain graphs, e.g. phase transition, the ratio of output signal to noise and input signal to noise, signal to noise output and also the ratio of percentage of accurate reconstructing and order of sparse signals for various reconstructing methods. To facilitate this process, the user would be able to draw his/her favorite graphs in GUI environment.

这项工作的主要目的是审查数据压缩的重要性，并提出一种快速的基于傅立叶的方法，用于在确定性压缩感知领域生成确定性压缩矩阵。已经定义了数据压缩的原理概念，例如数据压缩的一般过程，稀疏信号，相干矩阵和限制等距属性（RIP）。我们介绍了两种稀疏数据压缩方法。第一种方法是利用随机矩阵形成的，该随机矩阵是一种常用方法，第二种方法是利用最近提出的确定性矩阵创建的。这项工作的主要目标是改善确定性矩阵生成的执行时间。执行时间与确定性矩阵的生成方法有关。此外，我们已经实现了一种软件，可以比较重建数据压缩的不同方法。为了进行这种比较，有必要绘制和比较某些图形，例如，相变，输出信号与噪声的比率和输入信号与噪声，信噪比以及各种重建方法的精确重构百分比与稀疏信号的阶数之比。为了促进该过程，用户将能够在GUI环境中绘制他/她喜欢的图形。
