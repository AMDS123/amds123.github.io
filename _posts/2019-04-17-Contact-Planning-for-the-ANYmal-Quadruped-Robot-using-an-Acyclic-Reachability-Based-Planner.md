##### Abstract
Despite the great progress in quadrupedal robotics during the last decade, selecting good contacts (footholds) in highly uneven and cluttered environments still remains an open challenge. This paper builds upon a state-of-the-art approach, already successfully used for humanoid robots, and applies it to our robotic platform; the quadruped robot ANY-mal. The proposed algorithm decouples the problem into two subprob-lems: first a guide trajectory for the robot is generated, then contacts are created along this trajectory. Both subproblems rely on approximations and heuristics that need to be tuned. The main contribution of this work is to explain how this algorithm has been retuned to work with ANY-mal and to show the relevance of the approach with a variety of tests in realistic dynamic simulations.
