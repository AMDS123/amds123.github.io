##### Abstract
This paper evaluates the robustness of a DNN-HMM-based speech recognition system in highly-reverberant real environments using the HRRE database. The performance of locally-normalized filter bank (LNFB) and Mel filter bank (MelFB) features in combination with Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF), Suppression of Slowly-varying components and the Falling edge (SSF) and Weighted Prediction Error (WPE) enhancement methods are discussed and evaluated. Two training conditions were considered: clean and reverberated (Reverb). With Reverb training the use of WPE and LNFB provides WERs that are 3% and 20% lower in average than SSF and NMF, respectively. WPE and MelFB provides WERs that are 11% and 24% lower in average than SSF and NMF, respectively. With clean training, which represents a significant mismatch between testing and training conditions, LNFB features clearly outperform MelFB features. The results show that different types of training, parametrization, and enhancement techniques may work better for a specific combination of speaker-microphone distance and reverberation time. This suggests that there could be some degree of complementarity between systems trained with different enhancement and parametrization methods.

本文使用HRRE数据库评估基于DNN-HMM的语音识别系统在高度混响的真实环境中的鲁棒性。局部归一化滤波器组（LNFB）和梅尔滤波器组（MelFB）的特性结合非负矩阵分解（NMF），慢变组件的抑制和下降沿（SSF）和加权预测误差（WPE ）增强方法进行了讨论和评估。考虑了两种训练条件：干净和混响（混响）。通过混响训练，WPE和LNFB的使用提供的WER平均分别比SSF和NMF低3％和20％。 WPE和MelFB分别提供平均比SSF和NMF低11％和24％的WER。通过干净的培训，这代表了测试和培训条件之间显着的不匹配，LNFB特性明显优于MelFB特性。结果表明，对于扬声器 - 麦克风距离和混响时间的特定组合，不同类型的训练，参数化和增强技术可能会更好。这表明在用不同的增强和参数化方法训练的系统之间可能存在某种程度的互补性。
