##### Abstract
Taylor's law describes the fluctuation characteristics underlying a system in which the variance of an event within a time span grows by a power law with respect to the mean. Although Taylor's law has been applied in many natural and social systems, its application for language has been scarce. This article describes a new quantification of Taylor's law in natural language and reports an analysis of over 1100 texts across 14 languages. The Taylor exponents of written natural language texts were found to exhibit almost the same value. The exponent was also compared for other language-related data, such as the child-directed speech, music, and programming language code. The results show how the Taylor exponent serves to quantify the fundamental structural complexity underlying linguistic time series. The article also shows the applicability of these findings in evaluating language models.

泰勒定律描述了一个系统的波动特征，在该系统中，时间跨度内的事件的方差根据平均值的幂律增长。虽然泰勒定律已经应用于许多自然和社会系统，但它在语言中的应用却很少。本文介绍了泰勒自然语言定律的新定量，并对14种语言的1100多种文本进行了分析。发现书面自然语言文本的泰勒指数表现出几乎相同的价值。指数还与其他与语言有关的数据进行了比较，例如儿童指导语音，音乐和编程语言代码。结果显示了泰勒指数如何用来量化语言时间序列背后的基本结构复杂性。文章还显示了这些研究结果在语言模型评估中的适用性。
