##### Abstract
Following the rapidly growing digital image usage, automatic image categorization has become preeminent research area. It has broaden and adopted many algorithms from time to time, whereby multi-feature (generally, hand-engineered features) based image characterization comes handy to improve accuracy. Recently, in machine learning, pre-trained deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs or ConvNets) have been that the features extracted through such DCNN can improve classification accuracy. Thence, in this paper, we further investigate a feature embedding strategy to exploit cues from multiple DCNNs. We derive a generalized feature space by embedding three different DCNN bottleneck features with weights respect to their Softmax cross-entropy loss. Test outcomes on six different object classification data-sets and an action classification data-set show that regardless of variation in image statistics and tasks the proposed multi-DCNN bottleneck feature fusion is well suited to image classification tasks and an effective complement of DCNN. The comparisons to existing fusion-based image classification approaches prove that the proposed method surmounts the state-of-the-art methods and produces competitive results with fully trained DCNNs as well.

随着数字图像使用的迅速增长，自动图像分类已成为显着的研究领域。它不时地拓宽和采用了许多算法，借此基于多特征（通常手工特征）的图像表征便于提高准确性。最近，在机器学习中，预先训练的深度卷积神经网络（DCNN或ConvNets）是通过这种DCNN提取的特征可以提高分类准确性。因此，在本文中，我们进一步研究一个特征嵌入策略来利用来自多个DCNN的线索。我们通过嵌入三个不同的DCNN瓶颈特征来获得一个广义的特征空间，并考虑到它们的Softmax交叉熵损失的权重。 6个不同的目标分类数据集和一个动作分类数据集的测试结果表明，不管图像统计和任务的变化，所提出的多DCNN瓶颈特征融合非常适合图像分类任务和DCNN的有效补充。与现有的基于融合的图像分类方法的比较证明，所提出的方法超越了现有技术的方法，并且也利用训练有素的DCNN产生竞争结果。
