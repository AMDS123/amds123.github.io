##### Abstract
The difficulty of multi-class classification generally increases with the number of classes. Using data from a subset of the classes, can we predict how well a classifier will scale with an increased number of classes? Under the assumptions that the classes are sampled identically and independently from a population, and that the classifier is based on independently learned scoring functions, we show that the expected accuracy when the classifier is trained on k classes is the (k-1)st moment of a certain distribution that can be estimated from data. We present an unbiased estimation method based on the theory, and demonstrate its application on a facial recognition example.

多级分类的难度通常随着班级数量的增加而增加。使用这些类的子集中的数据，我们可以预测分类器将如何随着类数的增加而扩展？在假定类别的样本是相同和独立于人口的情况下，分类器是基于独立学习的评分函数的，我们证明了分类器在k类训练时的预期精度是（k-1）个时刻可以从数据估计的某种分布。我们提出了一个基于该理论的无偏估计方法，并展示了它在面部识别中的应用。
