##### Abstract
The Viola-Jones face detection algorithm was (and still is) a quite popular face detector. In spite of the numerous face detection techniques that have been recently presented, there are many research works that are still based on the Viola-Jones algorithm because of its simplicity. In this paper, we study the influence of a set of blind pre-processing methods on the face detection rate using the Viola-Jones algorithm. We focus on two aspects of improvement, specifically badly illuminated faces and blurred faces. Many methods for lighting invariant and deblurring are used in order to improve the detection accuracy. We want to avoid using blind pre-processing methods that may obstruct the face detector. To that end, we perform two sets of experiments. The first set is performed to avoid any blind pre-processing method that may hurt the face detector. The second set is performed to study the effect of the selected pre-processing methods on images that suffer from hard conditions. We present two manners of applying the pre-processing method to the image prior to being used by the Viola-Jones face detector. Four different datasets are used to draw a coherent conclusion about the potential improvement caused by using prior enhanced images. The results demonstrate that some of the pre-processing methods may hurt the accuracy of Viola-Jones face detection algorithm. However, other pre-processing methods have an evident positive impact on the accuracy of the face detector. Overall, we recommend three simple and fast blind photometric normalization methods as a pre-processing step in order to improve the accuracy of the pre-trained Viola-Jones face detector.

Viola-Jones人脸检测算法是（现在仍然是）相当受欢迎的人脸检测器。尽管最近提出了许多人脸检测技术，但由于其简单性，仍有许多研究工作仍基于Viola-Jones算法。在本文中，我们使用Viola-Jones算法研究一组盲人预处理方法对人脸检测率的影响。我们专注于两个方面的改进，特别是严重照明的面孔和模糊的面孔。为了提高检测精度，采用了许多照明不变和去模糊的方法。我们希望避免使用可能妨碍人脸检测器的盲预处理方法。为此，我们进行了两套实验。第一组是为了避免任何可能伤害人脸检测器的盲预处理方法。第二组是为了研究选定的预处理方法对遭受困难条件的图像的影响。在Viola-Jones人脸检测器使用之前，我们给出了两种预处理方法。使用四个不同的数据集对使用先前的增强图像导致的潜在改进作出一个连贯的结论。结果表明，一些预处理方法可能会损害Viola-Jones人脸检测算法的准确性。然而，其他的预处理方法对于人脸检测器的准确性具有明显的积极影响。总的来说，我们推荐三种简单快速的盲光度标准化方法作为预处理步骤，以提高预训练的Viola-Jones人脸检测器的精度。
