##### Abstract
We introduce the notions of the algebras of polynonial/rational $SO(2)$-invariants and prove that they are isomorphic to the algebras of moment invariants. Also, to simplify the calculating of invariants we pass from an action of Lie group $SO(2)$ to an action of its Lie algebra $\mathfrak{so}_2$. This allow us to reduce the problem to well known problems of the classical invariant theory.
