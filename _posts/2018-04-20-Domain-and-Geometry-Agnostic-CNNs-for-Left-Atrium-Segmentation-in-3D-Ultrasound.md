##### Abstract
Segmentation of the left atrium and deriving its size can help to predict and detect various cardiovascular conditions. Automation of this process in 3D Ultrasound image data is desirable, since manual delineations are time-consuming, challenging and observer-dependent. Convolutional neural networks have made improvements in computer vision and in medical image analysis. They have successfully been applied to segmentation tasks and were extended to work on volumetric data. In this paper we introduce a combined deep-learning based approach on volumetric segmentation in Ultrasound acquisitions with incorporation of prior knowledge about left atrial shape and imaging device. The results show, that including a shape prior helps the domain adaptation and the accuracy of segmentation is further increased with adversarial learning.

分割左心房并获得其大小可以帮助预测和检测各种心血管疾病。在3D超声图像数据中进行该过程的自动化是可取的，因为手动描绘是耗时的，具有挑战性并且与观察者有关。卷积神经网络在计算机视觉和医学图像分析方面取得了进步。它们已成功应用于分割任务，并已扩展到处理体积数据。在本文中，我们介绍了一种基于组合深度学习的超声采集体积分割方法，并结合了有关左心房形状和成像设备的先前知识。结果表明，包括形状先验有助于领域适应和分割的准确性进一步增加与敌对学习。
