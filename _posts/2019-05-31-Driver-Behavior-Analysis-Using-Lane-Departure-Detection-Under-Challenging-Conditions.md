##### Abstract
In this paper, we present a novel model to detect lane regions and extract lane departure events (changes and incursions) from challenging, lower-resolution videos recorded with mobile cameras. Our algorithm used a Mask-RCNN based lane detection model as pre-processor. Recently, deep learning-based models provide state-of-the-art technology for object detection combined with segmentation. Among the several deep learning architectures, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) outperformed other machine learning models, especially for region proposal and object detection tasks. Recent development in object detection has been driven by the success of region proposal methods and region-based CNNs (R-CNNs). Our algorithm utilizes lane segmentation mask for detection and Fix-lag Kalman filter for tracking, rather than the usual approach of detecting lane lines from single video frames. The algorithm permits detection of driver lane departures into left or right lanes from continuous lane detections. Preliminary results show promise for robust detection of lane departure events. The overall sensitivity for lane departure events on our custom test dataset is 81.81%.
