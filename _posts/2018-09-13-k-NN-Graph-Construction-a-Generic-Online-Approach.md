##### Abstract
Nearest neighbor search and k-nearest neighbor graph construction are two fundamental issues arise from many disciplines such as information retrieval, data-mining, machine learning and computer vision. Despite continuous efforts have been taken in the last several decades, these two issues remain challenging. They become more and more imminent given the big data emerges in various fields and has been expanded significantly over the years. In this paper, a simple but effective solution both for k-nearest neighbor search and k-nearest neighbor graph construction is presented. Namely, these two issues are addressed jointly. On one hand, the k-nearest neighbor graph construction is treated as a nearest neighbor search task. Each data sample along with its k-nearest neighbors are joined into the k-nearest neighbor graph by sequentially performing the nearest neighbor search on the graph under construction. On the other hand, the built k-nearest neighbor graph is used to support k-nearest neighbor search. Since the graph is built online, dynamic updating of the graph, which is not desirable from most of the existing solutions, is supported. Moreover, this solution is feasible for various distance measures. Its effectiveness both as a k-nearest neighbor construction and k-nearest neighbor search approach is verified across various datasets in different scales, various dimensions and under different metrics.

最近邻搜索和k近邻图构建是信息检索，数据挖掘，机器学习和计算机视觉等许多学科产生的两个基本问题。尽管在过去几十年中不断努力，但这两个问题仍然具有挑战性。鉴于大量数据出现在各个领域并且多年来已经大大扩展，它们变得越来越迫近。本文提出了一种简单但有效的解决方案，即k近邻搜索和k近邻图构造。即，这两个问题是共同解决的。一方面，k-最近邻图构造被视为最近邻搜索任务。通过在构造的图上顺序执行最近邻搜索，将每个数据样本连同其k-最近邻居连接到k-最近邻图中。另一方面，构建的k-最近邻图用于支持k-最近邻搜索。由于图形是在线构建的，因此支持图形的动态更新，这是大多数现有解决方案所不希望的。而且，该解决方案对于各种距离测量是可行的。它作为k-最近邻构造和k-最近邻搜索方法的有效性在不同尺度，不同尺寸和不同度量下的各种数据集中得到验证。
