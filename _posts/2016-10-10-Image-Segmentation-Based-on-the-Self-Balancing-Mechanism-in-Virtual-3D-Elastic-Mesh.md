##### Abstract
In this paper, a novel model of 3D elastic mesh is presented for image segmentation. The model is inspired by stress and strain in physical elastic objects, while the repulsive force and elastic force in the model are defined slightly different from the physical force to suit the segmentation problem well. The self-balancing mechanism in the model guarantees the stability of the method in segmentation. The shape of the elastic mesh at balance state is used for region segmentation, in which the sign distribution of the points'z coordinate values is taken as the basis for segmentation. The effectiveness of the proposed method is proved by analysis and experimental results for both test images and real world images.

##### Abstract (translated by Google)
本文提出了一种新的三维弹性网格模型用于图像分割。该模型受到物理弹性物体的应力和应变的启发，而模型中的排斥力和弹性力被定义为与物理力略有不同，以适应分割问题。模型中的自平衡机制保证了分割方法的稳定性。平衡状态下弹性网格的形状用于区域分割，其中点的坐标值的符号分布作为分割的基础。通过对测试图像和真实世界图像的分析和实验结果证明了所提出的方法的有效性。
