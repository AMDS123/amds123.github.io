##### Abstract
Monitoring of disasters is crucial for mitigating their effects on the environment and human population, and can be facilitated by the use of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV), equipped with camera sensors that produce aerial photos of the areas of interest. A modern technique for recognition of events based on aerial photos is deep learning. In this paper, we present the state of the art work related to the use of deep learning techniques for disaster identification. We demonstrate the potential of this technique in identifying disasters with high accuracy, by means of a relatively simple deep learning model. Based on a dataset of 544 images (containing disaster images such as fires, earthquakes, collapsed buildings, tsunami and flooding, as well as non-disaster scenes), our results show an accuracy of 91% achieved, indicating that deep learning, combined with UAV equipped with camera sensors, have the potential to predict disasters with high accuracy.

监测灾害对于减轻其对环境和人口的影响至关重要，并且可以通过使用配备有产生感兴趣区域的航空照片的相机传感器的无人驾驶飞行器（UAV）来促进。基于航空照片识别事件的现代技术是深度学习。在本文中，我们介绍了与使用深度学习技术进行灾害识别相关的最新工作。通过相对简单的深度学习模型，我们证明了这种技术在高精度识别灾害方面的潜力。基于544幅图像（包含火灾，地震，倒塌建筑物，海啸和洪水以及非灾害场景等灾害图像）的数据集，我们的结果显示实现了91％的准确性，表明深度学习，结合配备摄像头传感器的无人机具有高精度预测灾害的潜力。
