##### Abstract
Feature selection is among the most important components because it not only helps enhance the classification accuracy, but also or even more important provides potential biomarker discovery. However, traditional multivariate methods is likely to obtain unstable and unreliable results in case of an extremely high dimensional feature space and very limited training samples, where the features are often correlated or redundant. In order to improve the stability, generalization and interpretations of the discovered potential biomarker and enhance the robustness of the resultant classifier, the redundant but informative features need to be also selected. Therefore we introduced a novel feature selection method which combines a recent implementation of the stability selection approach and the elastic net approach. The advantage in terms of better control of false discoveries and missed discoveries of our approach, and the resulted better interpretability of the obtained potential biomarker is verified in both synthetic and real fMRI experiments. In addition, we are among the first to demonstrate the robustness of feature selection benefiting from the incorporation of stability selection and also among the first to demonstrate the possible unrobustness of the classical univariate two-sample t-test method. Specifically, we show the robustness of our feature selection results in existence of noisy (wrong) training labels, as well as the robustness of the resulted classifier based on our feature selection results in the existence of data variation, demonstrated by a multi-center attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) fMRI data.

特征选择是最重要的组成部分，因为它不仅有助于提高分类准确性，而且甚至更重要的是提供潜在的生物标志物发现。然而，传统的多变量方法在维数极高的特征空间和非常有限的训练样本的情况下可能会得到不稳定和不可靠的结果，而训练样本往往相关或冗余。为了提高所发现的潜在生物标志物的稳定性，概括性和解释性，并增强所得分类器的健壮性，还需要选择冗余但信息丰富的特征。因此，我们引入了一种新的特征选择方法，它结合了稳定性选择方法和弹性网络方法的最新实现。在更好地控制虚假发现和错误发现我们的方法方面的优势，以及所得到的潜在生物标志物的更好的可解释性在合成和实际fMRI实验中均得到验证。另外，我们首先证明了特征选择的稳健性，这受益于稳定性选择的纳入，也是第一个证明经典单变量双样本t检验方法可能不可靠的特征之一。具体来说，我们展示了在存在噪声（错误）训练标签的情况下特征选择结果的鲁棒性，以及基于特征选择的结果分类器的鲁棒性导致存在数据变化，由多中心注意 - 缺乏/多动症（ADHD）功能磁共振成像数据。
