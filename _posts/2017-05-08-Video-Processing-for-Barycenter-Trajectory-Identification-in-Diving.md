##### Abstract
The aim of this paper is to show a procedure for identify the barycentre of a diver by means of video processing. This procedure is aimed to introduce quantitative analysis tools and diving performance measurement and therefore in diving training. Sport performance analysis is a trend that is growing exponentially for all level athletes: it has been applied extensively in some sports such as cycling. Sport performance analysis has been applied mainly for high level athletes; in order to be used also for middle or low level athletes the proposed technique has to be flexible and low cost. Video processing is suitable to fulfil both these requirements. In diving, the first analysis that has to be done is the barycentre trajectory tracking.

本文的目的是展示一个通过视频处理来识别潜水员重心的程序。这个程序旨在介绍定量分析工具和潜水性能测量，因此在潜水培训。运动成绩分析是所有级别运动员都呈指数级增长的趋势：它已被广泛应用于单车等运动项目。运动成绩分析主要适用于高水平的运动员;为了也用于中低级运动员，所提出的技术必须是灵活的和低成本的。视频处理适合于满足这两个要求。在潜水中，首先要做的分析是重心轨迹跟踪。
