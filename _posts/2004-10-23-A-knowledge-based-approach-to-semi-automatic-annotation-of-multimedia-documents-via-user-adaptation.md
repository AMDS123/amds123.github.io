##### Abstract
Current approaches to the annotation process focus on annotation schemas, languages for annotation, or are very application driven. In this paper it is proposed that a more flexible architecture for annotation requires a knowledge component to allow for flexible search and navigation of the annotated material. In particular, it is claimed that a general approach must take into account the needs, competencies, and goals of the producers, annotators, and consumers of the annotated material. We propose that a user-model based approach is, therefore, necessary.
