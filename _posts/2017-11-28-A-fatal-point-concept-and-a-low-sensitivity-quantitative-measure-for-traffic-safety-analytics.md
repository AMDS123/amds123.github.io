##### Abstract
The variability of the clusters generated by clustering techniques in the domain of latitude and longitude variables of fatal crash data are significantly unpredictable. This unpredictability, caused by the randomness of fatal crash incidents, reduces the accuracy of crash frequency (i.e., counts of fatal crashes per cluster) which is used to measure traffic safety in practice. In this paper, a quantitative measure of traffic safety that is not significantly affected by the aforementioned variability is proposed. It introduces a fatal point -- a segment with the highest frequency of fatality -- concept based on cluster characteristics and detects them by imposing rounding errors to the hundredth decimal place of the longitude. The frequencies of the cluster and the cluster's fatal point are combined to construct a low-sensitive quantitative measure of traffic safety for the cluster. The performance of the proposed measure of traffic safety is then studied by varying the parameter k of k-means clustering with the expectation that other clustering techniques can be adopted in a similar fashion. The 2015 North Carolina fatal crash dataset of Fatality Analysis Reporting System (FARS) is used to evaluate the proposed fatal point concept and perform experimental analysis to determine the effectiveness of the proposed measure. The empirical study shows that the average traffic safety, measured by the proposed quantitative measure over several clusters, is not significantly affected by the variability, compared to that of the standard crash frequency.

在致命碰撞数据的纬度和经度变量的领域中由聚类技术产生的聚类的可变性是显着不可预知的。由致命的碰撞事故的随机性引起的这种不可预测性降低了在实践中用于测量交通安全的碰撞频率的准确性（即，每个集群的致命碰撞的计数）。在这篇论文中，提出了一个不受上述变化影响的交通安全的定量测量。它引入了一个致命点 - 死亡率最高的部分 - 基于聚类特征的概念，并通过对经度的小数第一百位施加舍入误差来检测它们。将集群的频率和集群的致命点相结合，构建集群交通安全的低敏感定量度量。然后，通过改变k均值聚类的参数k，期望可以以类似的方式采用其他聚类技术来研究所提出的交通安全度量的性能。使用死亡率分析报告系统（FARS）的2015年北卡罗来纳州致命的崩溃数据集来评估提议的致命点概念，并进行实验分析以确定所提议的措施的有效性。实证研究表明，与标准碰撞频率相比，通过所提出的数个集群的定量测量来衡量的平均交通安全性不会受到可变性的显着影响。
