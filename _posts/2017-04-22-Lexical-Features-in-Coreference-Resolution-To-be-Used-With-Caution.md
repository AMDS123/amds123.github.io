##### Abstract
Lexical features are a major source of information in state-of-the-art coreference resolvers. Lexical features implicitly model some of the linguistic phenomena at a fine granularity level. They are especially useful for representing the context of mentions. In this paper we investigate a drawback of using many lexical features in state-of-the-art coreference resolvers. We show that if coreference resolvers mainly rely on lexical features, they can hardly generalize to unseen domains. Furthermore, we show that the current coreference resolution evaluation is clearly flawed by only evaluating on a specific split of a specific dataset in which there is a notable overlap between the training, development and test sets.

词汇特征是最先进的共识解析器的主要信息来源。词法特征在精细的粒度级隐含地模拟了一些语言现象。它们对于表示提及的上下文特别有用。在本文中，我们研究了在最先进的共同参照解析器中使用许多词汇特征的缺点。我们表明，如果共同解决者主要依靠词汇特征，他们很难推广到不可见的领域。此外，我们表明，目前的共同决议评估显然是有缺陷的，只有评估一个特定的数据集，其中有明显的培训，发展和测试集之间的重叠分割。
