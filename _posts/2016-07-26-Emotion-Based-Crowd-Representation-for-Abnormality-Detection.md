##### Abstract
In crowd behavior understanding, a model of crowd behavior need to be trained using the information extracted from video sequences. Since there is no ground-truth available in crowd datasets except the crowd behavior labels, most of the methods proposed so far are just based on low-level visual features. However, there is a huge semantic gap between low-level motion/appearance features and high-level concept of crowd behaviors. In this paper we propose an attribute-based strategy to alleviate this problem. While similar strategies have been recently adopted for object and action recognition, as far as we know, we are the first showing that the crowd emotions can be used as attributes for crowd behavior understanding. The main idea is to train a set of emotion-based classifiers, which can subsequently be used to represent the crowd motion. For this purpose, we collect a big dataset of video clips and provide them with both annotations of "crowd behaviors" and "crowd emotions". We show the results of the proposed method on our dataset, which demonstrate that the crowd emotions enable the construction of more descriptive models for crowd behaviors. We aim at publishing the dataset with the article, to be used as a benchmark for the communities.

##### Abstract (translated by Google)
在人群行为理解中，需要使用从视频序列中提取的信息来训练人群行为模型。由于人群数据集中除了人群行为标签之外没有可用的地面实况，迄今为止提出的大多数方法都是基于低级别的视觉特征。然而，低级动作/表象特征与高级别人群行为概念之间存在巨大的语义鸿沟。在本文中，我们提出了一个基于属性的策略来缓解这个问题。尽管最近采用类似的策略进行对象和动作识别，但据我们所知，我们首先表明人群情感可以作为理解人群行为的属性。主要思想是训练一组基于情感的分类器，随后可以用它来表示人群的运动。为此，我们收集一个大的视频剪辑数据集，并为他们提供“人群行为”和“人群情感”的注释。我们在数据集上展示了所提出的方法的结果，这表明人群的情绪能够为人群行为建立更多的描述性模型。我们的目标是发表与文章的数据集，作为社区的基准。
