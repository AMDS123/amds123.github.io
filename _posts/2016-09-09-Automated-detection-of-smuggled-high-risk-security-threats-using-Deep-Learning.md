##### Abstract
The security infrastructure is ill-equipped to detect and deter the smuggling of non-explosive devices that enable terror attacks such as those recently perpetrated in western Europe. The detection of so-called "small metallic threats" (SMTs) in cargo containers currently relies on statistical risk analysis, intelligence reports, and visual inspection of X-ray images by security officers. The latter is very slow and unreliable due to the difficulty of the task: objects potentially spanning less than 50 pixels have to be detected in images containing more than 2 million pixels against very complex and cluttered backgrounds. In this contribution, we demonstrate for the first time the use of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), a type of Deep Learning, to automate the detection of SMTs in fullsize X-ray images of cargo containers. Novel approaches for dataset augmentation allowed to train CNNs from-scratch despite the scarcity of data available. We report fewer than 6% false alarms when detecting 90% SMTs synthetically concealed in stream-of-commerce images, which corresponds to an improvement of over an order of magnitude over conventional approaches such as Bag-of-Words (BoWs). The proposed scheme offers potentially super-human performance for a fraction of the time it would take for a security officers to carry out visual inspection (processing time is approximately 3.5s per container image).

安全基础设施装备不足，无法侦测和遏制偷运非爆炸性装置的行为，这些装置能够使西欧最近发生的恐怖袭击事件得到有效控制。货物集装箱中所谓的“小型金属威胁”（SMTs）的检测目前依赖于统计风险分析，情报报告以及安保人员对X射线图像的视觉检查。由于任务的困难，后者是非常缓慢且不可靠的：对于非常复杂和杂乱的背景，必须在包含超过200万像素的图像中检测到潜在跨越小于50像素的对象。在这项贡献中，我们首次证明了使用卷积神经网络（CNN）这种深度学习，可以在货物集装箱的全尺寸X射线图像中自动检测SMT。数据集增强的新方法允许从零开始训练CNN，尽管数据稀缺。当检测到合成隐藏在商业流图像中的90％SMT时，我们报告的误报少于6％，这相对于诸如袋子字（BoWs）之类的常规方法改善了一个数量级。所提出的方案提供潜在的超人类表现，安保人员进行视觉检查（处理时间大约为每个容器图像大约3.5s）将花费一小部分时间。
