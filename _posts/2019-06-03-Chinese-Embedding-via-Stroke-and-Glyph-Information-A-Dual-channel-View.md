##### Abstract
Recent studies have consistently given positive hints that morphology is helpful in enriching word embeddings. In this paper, we argue that Chinese word embeddings can be substantially enriched by the morphological information hidden in characters which is reflected not only in strokes order sequentially, but also in character glyphs spatially. Then, we propose a novel Dual-channel Word Embedding (DWE) model to realize the joint learning of sequential and spatial information of characters. Through the evaluation on both word similarity and word analogy tasks, our model shows its rationality and superiority in modelling the morphology of Chinese.
