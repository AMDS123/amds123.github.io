##### Abstract
We proposes a novel single-shot high dynamic range imaging scheme with spatially varying exposures (SVE) considering hue distortion. Single-shot imaging with SVE enables us to capture multi-exposure images from a single-shot image, so high dynamic range images can be produced without ghost artifacts. However, SVE images have some pixels at which a range supported by camera sensors is exceeded. Therefore, generated images have some color distortion, so that conventional imaging with SVE has never considered the influence of this range limitation. To overcome this issue, we consider estimating the correct hue of a scene from raw images, and propose a method with the estimated hue information for correcting the hue of SVE images on the constant hue plain in the RGB color space.
