##### Abstract
In this paper, we propose a novel projector-camera system for practical and low-cost acquisition of a dense object 3D model with the spectral reflectance property. In our system, we use a standard RGB camera and leverage an off-the-shelf projector as active illumination for both the 3D reconstruction and the spectral reflectance estimation. We first reconstruct the 3D points while estimating the poses of the camera and the projector, which are alternately moved around the object, by combining multi-view structured light and structure-from-motion (SfM) techniques. We then exploit the projector for multispectral imaging and estimate the spectral reflectance of each 3D point based on a novel spectral reflectance estimation model considering the geometric relationship between the reconstructed 3D points and the estimated projector positions. Experimental results on several real objects demonstrate that our system can precisely acquire a dense 3D model with the full spectral reflectance property using off-the-shelf devices.
