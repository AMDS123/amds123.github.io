##### Abstract
Background: Social media has the capacity to afford the healthcare industry with valuable feedback from patients who reveal and express their medical decision-making process, as well as self-reported quality of life indicators both during and post treatment. In prior work, [Crannell et. al.], we have studied an active cancer patient population on Twitter and compiled a set of tweets describing their experience with this disease. We refer to these online public testimonies as "Invisible Patient Reported Outcomes" (iPROs), because they carry relevant indicators, yet are difficult to capture by conventional means of self-report. Methods: Our present study aims to identify tweets related to the patient experience as an additional informative tool for monitoring public health. Using Twitter's public streaming API, we compiled over 5.3 million "breast cancer" related tweets spanning September 2016 until mid December 2017. We combined supervised machine learning methods with natural language processing to sift tweets relevant to breast cancer patient experiences. We analyzed a sample of 845 breast cancer patient and survivor accounts, responsible for over 48,000 posts. We investigated tweet content with a hedonometric sentiment analysis to quantitatively extract emotionally charged topics. Results: We found that positive experiences were shared regarding patient treatment, raising support, and spreading awareness. Further discussions related to healthcare were prevalent and largely negative focusing on fear of political legislation that could result in loss of coverage. Conclusions: Social media can provide a positive outlet for patients to discuss their needs and concerns regarding their healthcare coverage and treatment needs. Capturing iPROs from online communication can help inform healthcare professionals and lead to more connected and personalized treatment regimens.

背景：社交媒体有能力向医疗保健行业提供来自揭示和表达其医疗决策过程的患者的宝贵反馈，以及治疗期间和治疗后自我报告的生活质量指标。在之前的工作中，[Crannell et。我们已经在推特上研究了一个活跃的癌症患者群体，并编写了一系列推文来描述他们对这种疾病的经验。我们将这些在线公开证词称为“隐形患者报告结局”（iPRO），因为它们带有相关指标，但通过传统的自我报告手段难以捕捉。方法：我们目前的研究旨在确定与患者体验相关的推文作为监测公共健康的额外信息工具。使用Twitter的公共流媒体API，我们编译了跨越2016年9月至2017年12月中旬的超过530万个“乳腺癌”相关推文。我们将受监督的机器学习方法与自然语言处理相结合，筛选出与乳腺癌患者体验相关的推文。我们分析了845例乳腺癌患者和幸存者账户的样本，负责超过48,000个职位。我们通过hedonometric情绪分析来调查tweet内容，以定量提取情绪化主题。结果：我们发现，在患者治疗，提高支持和传播意识方面共享积极的经验。与医疗保健有关的进一步讨论普遍存在，主要是负面的，主要是担心可能会导致覆盖面丧失的政治立法。结论：社交媒体可以为患者提供一个积极的渠道，以讨论他们在医疗保健覆盖和治疗需求方面的需求和担忧。从在线沟通中捕捉iPRO可以帮助医疗保健专业人员通知，并导致更多连接和个性化的治疗方案。
