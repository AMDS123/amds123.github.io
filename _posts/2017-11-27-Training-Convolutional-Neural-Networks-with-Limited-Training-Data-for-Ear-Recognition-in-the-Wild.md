##### Abstract
Identity recognition from ear images is an active field of research within the biometric community. The ability to capture ear images from a distance and in a covert manner makes ear recognition technology an appealing choice for surveillance and security applications as well as related application domains. In contrast to other biometric modalities, where large datasets captured in uncontrolled settings are readily available, datasets of ear images are still limited in size and mostly of laboratory-like quality. As a consequence, ear recognition technology has not benefited yet from advances in deep learning and convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and is still lacking behind other modalities that experienced significant performance gains owing to deep recognition technology. In this paper we address this problem and aim at building a CNNbased ear recognition model. We explore different strategies towards model training with limited amounts of training data and show that by selecting an appropriate model architecture, using aggressive data augmentation and selective learning on existing (pre-trained) models, we are able to learn an effective CNN-based model using a little more than 1300 training images. The result of our work is the first CNN-based approach to ear recognition that is also made publicly available to the research community. With our model we are able to improve on the rank one recognition rate of the previous state-of-the-art by more than 25% on a challenging dataset of ear images captured from the web (a.k.a. in the wild).

耳朵图像的身份识别是生物识别领域的一个活跃的研究领域。从远距离和隐蔽的方式捕捉耳朵图像的能力使得耳朵识别技术成为监视和安全应用以及相关应用领域的有吸引力的选择。与其他生物识别方式相比，在不受控制的设置中捕获的大型数据集容易获得的情况下，耳朵图像的数据集的尺寸仍然有限，并且大部分是类似实验室的质量。因此，耳识别技术还没有从深度学习和卷积神经网络（CNN）的进步中受益，并且由于深度识别技术而仍然缺乏其他经历显着性能增益的模式。在本文中，我们解决这个问题，旨在建立一个基于CNN的耳朵识别模型。我们通过有限的训练数据来探索不同的模型训练策略，并通过选择适当的模型架构，在现有（预训练）的模型上使用积极的数据增强和选择性学习，我们能够学习一个有效的基于CNN的模型使用1300多个训练图像。我们的工作成果是第一个基于CNN的耳朵识别方法，也向研究界公开。利用我们的模型，我们能够在从网络（也称为野外）捕获的具有挑战性的耳朵图像数据集上，将先前技术水平的一级识别率提高25％以上。
