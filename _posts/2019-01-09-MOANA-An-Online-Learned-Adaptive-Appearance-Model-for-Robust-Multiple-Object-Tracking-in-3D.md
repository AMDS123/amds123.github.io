##### Abstract
Multiple object tracking has been a challenging field, mainly due to noisy detection sets and identity switch caused by occlusion and similar appearance among nearby targets. In this work, we propose an adaptive model that learns online a relatively long-term appearance change of each target. The proposed model is compatible with any feature of fixed dimension or their combination, whose learning rates are dynamically controlled by adaptive update and spatial weighting schemes. To handle occlusion and nearby objects sharing similar appearance, we also design cross-matching and re-identification schemes based on the application of the proposed adaptive appearance models. Additionally, the 3D geometry information is effectively incorporated in our formulation for data association. The proposed method outperforms all the state-of-the-art on the MOTChallenge 3D benchmark and achieves real-time computation with only a standard desktop CPU. It has also shown superior performance over the state-of-the-art on the 2D benchmark of MOTChallenge.
