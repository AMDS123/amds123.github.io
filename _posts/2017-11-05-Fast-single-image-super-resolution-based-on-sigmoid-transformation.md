##### Abstract
Single image super-resolution aims to generate a high-resolution image from a single low-resolution image, which is of great significance in extensive applications. As an ill-posed problem, numerous methods have been proposed to reconstruct the missing image details based on exemplars or priors. In this paper, we propose a fast and simple single image super-resolution strategy utilizing patch-wise sigmoid transformation as an imposed sharpening regularization term in the reconstruction, which realizes amazing reconstruction performance. Extensive experiments compared with other state-of-the-art approaches demonstrate the superior effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed algorithm.

单幅图像超分辨率的目标是从单个低分辨率图像生成高分辨率图像，这在广泛的应用中具有重要意义。作为不适合的问题，已经提出了许多方法来基于示例或先验来重建丢失的图像细节。在本文中，我们提出了一个快速和简单的单一图像超分辨率战略利用补丁明智sigmoid变换作为强加的锐化正则化术语在重建，实现惊人的重建性能。与其他最先进的方法相比的大量实验证明了所提出的算法的优越的有效性和效率。
