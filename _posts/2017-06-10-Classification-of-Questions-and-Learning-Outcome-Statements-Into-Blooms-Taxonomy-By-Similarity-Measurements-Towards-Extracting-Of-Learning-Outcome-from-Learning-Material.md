##### Abstract
Blooms Taxonomy (BT) have been used to classify the objectives of learning outcome by dividing the learning into three different domains; the cognitive domain, the effective domain and the psychomotor domain. In this paper, we are introducing a new approach to classify the questions and learning outcome statements (LOS) into Blooms taxonomy (BT) and to verify BT verb lists, which are being cited and used by academicians to write questions and (LOS). An experiment was designed to investigate the semantic relationship between the action verbs used in both questions and LOS to obtain more accurate classification of the levels of BT. A sample of 775 different action verbs collected from different universities allows us to measure an accurate and clear-cut cognitive level for the action verb. It is worth mentioning that natural language processing techniques were used to develop our rules as to induce the questions into chunks in order to extract the action verbs. Our proposed solution was able to classify the action verb into a precise level of the cognitive domain. We, on our side, have tested and evaluated our proposed solution using confusion matrix. The results of evaluation tests yielded 97% for the macro average of precision and 90% for F1. Thus, the outcome of the research suggests that it is crucial to analyse and verify the action verbs cited and used by academicians to write LOS and classify their questions based on blooms taxonomy in order to obtain a definite and more accurate classification.

通过将学习分为三个不同的领域，Blooms Taxonomy（BT）被用来分类学习成果的目标;认知领域，有效领域和精神运动领域。在本文中，我们引入了一种将问题和学习结果陈述（LOS）分类为Blooms分类法（BT）的新方法，并且验证了院士引用和使用的BT动词列表（LOS）。设计一个实验来研究在问题和LOS中使用的动作动词之间的语义关系，以获得对BT水平的更精确的分类。从不同大学收集的775个不同动作动词的样本，使我们能够测量动作动词的准确和明确的认知水平。值得一提的是，自然语言处理技术被用来制定我们的规则，以便将问题分成块来提取动作动词。我们提出的解决方案能够将动作动词分类到认知领域的精确水平。我们在这方面已经使用混淆矩阵对我们提出的解决方案进行了测试和评估。评价结果的宏观平均精度为97％，F1为90％。因此，研究结果表明，分析和验证院士们引用和使用的动作动词是非常重要的，这些动词动词是基于blooms分类法编写LOS和分类问题的，从而获得更为准确和更准确的分类。
