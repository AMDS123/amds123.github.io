##### Abstract
The main aim of this paper is to propose a color texture classification approach which uses color sensor information and texture features jointly. High accuracy, low noise sensitivity and low computational complexity are specified aims for our proposed approach. One of the efficient texture analysis operations is local binary patterns. The proposed approach includes two steps. First, a noise resistant version of color local binary patterns is proposed to decrease sensitivity to noise of LBP. This step is evaluated based on combination of color sensor information using AND operation. In second step, a significant points selection algorithm is proposed to select significant LBP. This phase decreases final computational complexity along with increasing accuracy rate. The Proposed approach is evaluated using Vistex, Outex, and KTH TIPS2a data sets. Our approach has been compared with some state of the art methods. It is experimentally demonstrated that the proposed approach achieves highest accuracy. In two other experiments, result show low noise sensitivity and low computational complexity of the proposed approach in comparison with previous versions of LBP. Rotation invariant, multi resolution, general usability are other advantages of our proposed approach. In the present paper, a new version of LBP is proposed originally, which is called Hybrid color local binary patterns. It can be used in many image processing applications to extract color and texture features jointly. Also, a significant point selection algorithm is proposed for the first time to select key points of images.
