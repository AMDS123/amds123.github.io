##### Abstract
Reconstructing 3D shapes from a sequence of images has long been a problem of interest in computer vision. Classical Structure from Motion (SfM) methods have attempted to solve this problem through projected point displacement \& bundle adjustment. More recently, deep methods have attempted to solve this problem by directly learning a relationship between geometry and appearance. There is, however, a significant gap between these two strategies. SfM tackles the problem from purely a geometric perspective, taking no account of the object shape prior. Modern deep methods more often throw away geometric constraints altogether, rendering the results unreliable. In this paper we make an effort to bring these two seemingly disparate strategies together. We introduce learned shape prior in the form of deep shape generators into Photometric Bundle Adjustment (PBA) and propose to accommodate full 3D shape generated by the shape prior within the optimization-based inference framework, demonstrating impressive results.

从一系列图像中重建3D形状一直是计算机视觉领域的一个热点问题。运动的古典结构（SfM）方法试图通过投影点位移和束调整来解决这个问题。最近，深层次的方法试图通过直接学习几何和外观之间的关系来解决这个问题。然而，这两种战略之间存在重大差距。 SfM从纯粹的几何角度来解决问题，而不考虑之前的物体形状。现代的深层方法通常会抛弃几何约束，导致结果不可靠。在本文中，我们努力将这两种看似不同的策略结合在一起。我们先将学习过的形状以深度形状发生器的形式引入光度束调整（PBA），并建议在基于优化的推理框架内容纳由形状产生的完整3D形状，展示令人印象深刻的结果。
