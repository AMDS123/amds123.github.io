##### Abstract
In order to successfully annotate the Arabic speech con- tent found in open-domain media broadcasts, it is essential to be able to process a diverse set of Arabic dialects. For the 2017 Multi-Genre Broadcast challenge (MGB-3) there were two possible tasks: Arabic speech recognition, and Arabic Dialect Identification (ADI). In this paper, we describe our efforts to create an ADI system for the MGB-3 challenge, with the goal of distinguishing amongst four major Arabic dialects, as well as Modern Standard Arabic. Our research fo- cused on dialect variability and domain mismatches between the training and test domain. In order to achieve a robust ADI system, we explored both Siamese neural network models to learn similarity and dissimilarities among Arabic dialects, as well as i-vector post-processing to adapt domain mismatches. Both Acoustic and linguistic features were used for the final MGB-3 submissions, with the best primary system achieving 75% accuracy on the official 10hr test set.

为了成功地注解开放域媒体广播中的阿拉伯语言内容，必须能够处理各种阿拉伯语方言。对于2017年多种类型广播挑战（MGB-3），有两个可能的任务：阿拉伯语言识别和阿拉伯方言识别（ADI）。在本文中，我们描述了为MGB-3挑战创建ADI系统的努力，其目标是区分阿拉伯四大方言和现代标准阿拉伯语。我们的研究侧重于训练和测试领域之间的方言可变性和领域不匹配。为了实现强大的ADI系统，我们探索了连体神经网络模型，以学习阿拉伯语方言之间的相似性和差异性，以及i向量后处理以适应域不匹配。声学和语言学特征被用于最终的MGB-3提交，最好的主要系统在正式的10小时测试集上达到75％的准确度。
