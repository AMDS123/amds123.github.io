##### Abstract
We describe a large, high-quality benchmark for the evaluation of Mention Detection tools. The benchmark contains annotations of both named entities as well as other types of entities, annotated on different types of text, ranging from clean text taken from Wikipedia, to noisy spoken data. The benchmark was built through a highly controlled crowd sourcing process to ensure its quality. We describe the benchmark, the process and the guidelines that were used to build it. We then demonstrate the results of a state-of-the-art system running on that benchmark.

##### Abstract (translated by Google)
我们描述了一个大型的高质量基准，用于评估Mention Detection工具。基准测试包含了两个命名实体的注释以及其他类型的实体，注释了不同类型的文本，范围从维基百科获取的干净文本到嘈杂的口头数据。基准是通过高度控制的人群采购流程来确保其质量。我们描述了用于构建它的基准，过程和指南。然后，我们演示一个运行在该基准上的最新系统的结果。
