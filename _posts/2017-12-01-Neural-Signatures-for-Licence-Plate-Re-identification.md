##### Abstract
The problem of vehicle licence plate re-identification is generally considered as a one-shot image retrieval problem. The objective of this task is to learn a feature representation (called a "signature") for licence plates. Incoming licence plate images are converted to signatures and matched to a previously collected template database through a distance measure. Then, the input image is recognized as the template whose signature is "nearest" to the input signature. The template database is restricted to contain only a single signature per unique licence plate for our problem. We measure the performance of deep convolutional net-based features adapted from face recognition on this task. In addition, we also test a hybrid approach combining the Fisher vector with a neural network-based embedding called "f2nn" trained with the Triplet loss function. We find that the hybrid approach performs comparably while providing computational benefits. The signature generated by the hybrid approach also shows higher generalizability to datasets more dissimilar to the training corpus.

车牌再识别问题一般被认为是一次性图像检索问题。这个任务的目标是学习牌照的特征表示（称为“签名”）。传入车牌图像转换为签名，并通过距离度量与以前收集的模板数据库相匹配。然后，输入图像被识别为其签名与输入签名“最接近”的模板。模板数据库被限制为仅包含针对我们的问题的每个唯一牌照的单个签名。我们测量了这个任务中从人脸识别改编的深度卷积网络特征的性能。此外，我们还测试了一种混合方法，将Fisher矢量与基于神经网络的称为“f2nn”的嵌入相结合，用Triplet损失函数进行训练。我们发现混合方法在提供计算效益的同时表现相当。由混合方法生成的签名也对训练语料库更不相似的数据集具有更高的普遍性。
