##### Abstract
Classification of vertebral compression fractures (VCF) having osteoporotic or neoplastic origin is fundamental to the planning of treatment. We developed a fracture classification system by acquiring quantitative morphologic and bone density determinants of fracture progression through the use of automated measurements from longitudinal studies. A total of 250 CT studies were acquired for the task, each having previously identified VCFs with osteoporosis or neoplasm. Thirty-six features or each identified VCF were computed and classified using a committee of support vector machines. Ten-fold cross validation on 695 identified fractured vertebrae showed classification accuracies of 0.812, 0.665, and 0.820 for the measured, longitudinal, and combined feature sets respectively.

具有骨质疏松或肿瘤起源的椎体压缩性骨折（VCF）的分类是治疗计划的基础。我们通过使用纵向研究的自动化测量来获取骨折进展的定量形态学和骨密度决定因素来开发骨折分类系统。总共收集了250项CT研究，每项研究都有以前发现的伴有骨质疏松症或肿瘤的VCFs。使用支持向量机委员会来计算和分类36个特征或每个确定的VCF。对695个确定的骨折椎体进行10倍交叉验证，分别对于测量的，纵向的和组合的特征集合，分类准确度分别为0.812,0.665和0.820。
