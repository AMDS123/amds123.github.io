##### Abstract
Mapping and translating professional but arcane clinical jargons to consumer language is essential to improve the patient-clinician communication. Researchers have used the existing biomedical ontologies and consumer health vocabulary dictionary to translate between the languages. However, such approaches are limited by expert efforts to manually build the dictionary, which is hard to be generalized and scalable. In this work, we utilized the embeddings alignment method for the word mapping between unparalleled clinical professional and consumer language embeddings. To map semantically similar words in two different word embeddings, we first independently trained word embeddings on both the corpus with abundant clinical professional terms and the other with mainly healthcare consumer terms. Then, we aligned the embeddings by the Procrustes algorithm. We also investigated the approach with the adversarial training with refinement. We evaluated the quality of the alignment through the similar words retrieval both by computing the model precision and as well as judging qualitatively by human. We show that the Procrustes algorithm can be performant for the professional consumer language embeddings alignment, whereas adversarial training with refinement may find some relations between two languages.

映射和翻译专业但神秘的临床专业词汇到消费者语言对于改善患者 - 临床医生沟通至关重要。研究人员已经使用现有的生物医学本体论和消费者健康词汇词典来翻译各种语言。然而，这种方法受到专家努力手动构建字典的限制，这很难被推广和扩展。在这项工作中，我们利用嵌入对齐方法进行无与伦比的临床专业和消费者语言嵌入之间的词映射。为了在两种不同的词嵌入中映射语义上相似的词，我们首先在具有丰富临床专业术语的语料库上独立训练词嵌入，另一种主要以医疗消费者术语为主。然后，我们通过Procrustes算法对齐嵌入。我们还通过精炼的对抗训练来调查这种方法。我们通过计算模型精度以及通过人类定性判断，通过类似的词检索来评估对齐的质量。我们表明，Procrustes算法可以表现为专业消费者语言嵌入对齐，而敌对训练与细化可能会发现两种语言之间的一些关系。
