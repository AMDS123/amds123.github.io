##### Abstract
To reduce the x-ray dose in computerized tomography (CT), many constrained optimization approaches have been proposed aiming at minimizing a regularizing function that measures lack of consistency with some prior knowledge about the object that is being imaged, subject to a (predetermined) level of consistency with the detected attenuation of x-rays. Proponents of the shearlet transform in the regularizing function claim that the reconstructions so obtained are better than those produced using TV for texture preservation (but may be worse for noise reduction). In this paper we report results related to this claim. In our reported experiments using simulated CT data collection of the head, reconstructions whose shearlet transform has a small $\ell_1$-norm are not more efficacious than reconstructions that have a small TV value. Our experiments for making such comparisons use the recently-developed superiorization methodology for both regularizing functions. Superiorization is an automated procedure for turning an iterative algorithm for producing images that satisfy a primary criterion (such as consistency with the observed measurements) into its superiorized version that will produce results that, according to the primary criterion are as good as those produced by the original algorithm, but in addition are superior to them according to a secondary (regularizing) criterion. The method presented for superiorization involving the $\ell_1$-norm of the shearlet transform is novel and is quite general: It can be used for any regularizing function that is defined as the $\ell_1$-norm of a transform specified by the application of a matrix. Because in the previous literature the split Bregman algorithm is used for similar purposes, a section is included comparing the results of the superiorization algorithm with the split Bregman algorithm.

为了减少计算机断层扫描（CT）中的X射线剂量，已经提出了许多限制性优化方法，旨在最小化正规化功能，该正规化功能测量与正在成像的对象的一些先前知识的不一致性，服从（预定的）与检测到的X射线衰减一致的水平。正则化函数中的剪切变换的支持者声称这样获得的重构比用电视产生的重构更好，但是对于降噪可能更差。在本文中，我们报告与这个索赔相关的结果。在我们所报道的使用模拟头部CT数据收集的实验中，其剪切变换具有小的$ \ n_l_norm的重建不比具有小TV值的重建更有效。我们做这种比较的实验使用最近开发的优化方法来调整函数。优化是一种自动化程序，用于将产生满足主要标准（例如与观察到的测量的一致性）的图像的迭代算法转变为其优化版本，其将产生根据主要标准与由原始算法，而且根据二次（正则化）准则，它们优于它们。提出的涉及shearlet变换的$ \ ell_1 $ -norm的优化方法是新颖的，并且是相当普遍的：它可以用于任何正则化函数，该函数被定义为由应用程序指定的变换的$ \ ell_1 $ -norm的矩阵。因为在以前的文献中，分裂Bregman算法被用于类似的目的，所以包括将优化算法的结果与分裂Bregman算法进行比较的部分。
