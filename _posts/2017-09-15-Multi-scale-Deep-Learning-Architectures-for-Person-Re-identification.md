##### Abstract
Person Re-identification (re-id) aims to match people across non-overlapping camera views in a public space. It is a challenging problem because many people captured in surveillance videos wear similar clothes. Consequently, the differences in their appearance are often subtle and only detectable at the right location and scales. Existing re-id models, particularly the recently proposed deep learning based ones match people at a single scale. In contrast, in this paper, a novel multi-scale deep learning model is proposed. Our model is able to learn deep discriminative feature representations at different scales and automatically determine the most suitable scales for matching. The importance of different spatial locations for extracting discriminative features is also learned explicitly. Experiments are carried out to demonstrate that the proposed model outperforms the state-of-the art on a number of benchmarks

个人重新识别（re-id）旨在在公共空间中匹配非重叠摄像机视角的人员。这是一个具有挑战性的问题，因为监控录像中捕获的许多人都穿着类似的衣服因此，它们的外观差异往往是微妙的，只有在正确的位置和尺度才能检测到。现有的re-id模型，尤其是最近提出的基于深度学习的模型，可以与单一人群相匹配。相比之下，本文提出了一种新的多尺度深度学习模型。我们的模型能够学习不同尺度的深度判别性特征表示，并自动确定最适合的匹配尺度。还明确了解不同空间位置提取判别特征的重要性。进行实验来证明所提出的模型在许多基准上优于现有技术
