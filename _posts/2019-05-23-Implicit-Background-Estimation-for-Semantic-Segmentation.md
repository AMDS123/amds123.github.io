##### Abstract
Scene understanding and semantic segmentation are at the core of many computer vision tasks, many of which, involve interacting with humans in potentially dangerous ways. It is therefore paramount that techniques for principled design of robust models be developed. In this paper, we provide analytic and empirical evidence that correcting potentially errant non-distinct mappings that result from the softmax function can result in improving robustness characteristics on a state-of-the-art semantic segmentation model with minimal impact to performance and minimal changes to the code base.
