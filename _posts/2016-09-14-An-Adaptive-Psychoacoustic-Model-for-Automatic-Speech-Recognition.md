##### Abstract
Compared with automatic speech recognition (ASR), the human auditory system is more adept at handling noise-adverse situations, including environmental noise and channel distortion. To mimic this adeptness, auditory models have been widely incorporated in ASR systems to improve their robustness. This paper proposes a novel auditory model which incorporates psychoacoustics and otoacoustic emissions (OAEs) into ASR. In particular, we successfully implement the frequency-dependent property of psychoacoustic models and effectively improve resulting system performance. We also present a novel double-transform spectrum-analysis technique, which can qualitatively predict ASR performance for different noise types. Detailed theoretical analysis is provided to show the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm. Experiments are carried out on the AURORA2 database and show that the word recognition rate using our proposed feature extraction method is significantly increased over the baseline. Given models trained with clean speech, our proposed method achieves up to 85.39% word recognition accuracy on noisy data.

与自动语音识别（ASR）相比，人类听觉系统更善于处理噪声不利的情况，包括环境噪声和信道失真。为了模仿这种熟练程度，听觉模型已被广泛纳入ASR系统，以提高其鲁棒性。本文提出了一种将心理声学和耳声发射（ASE）纳入ASR的新型听觉​​模型。特别是，我们成功地实现了心理声学模型的频率依赖特性，并有效地提高了系统性能。我们还提出了一种新的双变换谱分析技术，可以定性地预测不同噪声类型的ASR性能。给出了详细的理论分析，说明了该算法的有效性。在AURORA2数据库上进行实验，结果表明，使用我们提出的特征提取方法的词识别率在基线上显着增加。给定用干净的语音训练的模型，我们提出的方法在噪声数据上达到高达85.39％的字识别精度。
