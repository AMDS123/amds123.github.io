##### Abstract
The main goal of this project is that the basic EKF-based SLAM operation can be implemented sufficiently for estimating the state of the UGV that is operated in this real environment involving dynamic objects. Several problems in practical implementation of SLAM operation such as processing measurement data, removing bias measurement, extracting landmarks from the measurement data, pre-filtering extracted landmarks and data association in the observed landmarks are observed during the operation of EKF-based SLAM system . In addition, the comparison of EKF-based SLAM operation with dead reckoning operation and Global Positioning System (GPS) are also performed to determine the effectiveness and performance of EKF-based SLAM operation in the real environment.
