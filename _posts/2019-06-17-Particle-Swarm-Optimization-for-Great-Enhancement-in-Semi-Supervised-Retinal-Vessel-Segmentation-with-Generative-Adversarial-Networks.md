##### Abstract
Retinal vessel segmentation based on deep learning requires a lot of manual labeled data. That is time-consuming, laborious and professional. What is worse, the acquisition of abundant fundus images is difficult. These problems are more serious due to the presence of abnormalities, varying size and shape of the vessels, non-uniform illumination and anatomical changes. In this paper, we propose a data-efficient semi-supervised learning framework, which effectively combines the existing deep learning network with GAN and self-training ideas. In view of the difficulty of tuning hyper-parameters of semi-supervised learning, we propose a method for hyper-parameters selection based on particle swarm optimization algorithm. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first demonstration that combines intelligent optimization with semi-supervised learning for achieving the best performance. Under the collaboration of adversarial learning, self-training and PSO to select optimal hyper-parameters, we obtain the performance of retinal vessel segmentation approximate to or even better than representative supervised learning using only one tenth of the labeled data from DRIVE.
