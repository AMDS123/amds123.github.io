##### Abstract
This paper is concerned with possibility of recovery of motion and structure parameters from multiframes under perspective projection when only points on a rigid body are traced. Free (unrestricted and uncontrolled) pattern of motion between frames is assumed. The major question is how many points and/or how many frames are necessary for the task. It has been shown in an earlier paper {Klopotek:95b} that for orthogonal projection two frames are insufficient for the task. The paper demonstrates that, under perspective projection, that total uncertainty about relative position of focal point versus projection plane makes the recovery of structure and motion from two frames impossible.
