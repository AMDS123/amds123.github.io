##### Abstract
Informing professionals about the latest research results in their field is a particularly important task in the field of health care, since any development in this field directly improves the health status of the patients. Meanwhile, social media is an infrastructure that allows public instant sharing of information, thus it has recently become popular in medical applications. In this study, we apply Multi Distance Knowledge Graph Embeddings (MDE) to link physicians and surgeons to the latest medical breakthroughs that are shared as the research results on Twitter. Our study shows that using this method physicians can be informed about the new findings in their field given that they have an account dedicated to their profession.
