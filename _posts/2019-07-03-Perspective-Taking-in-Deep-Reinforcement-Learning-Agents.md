##### Abstract
Perspective taking is the ability to take the point of view of another agent. This skill is not unique to humans as it is also displayed by other animals like chimpanzees. It is an essential ability for efficient social interactions, including cooperation, competition, and communication. In this work, we present our progress toward building artificial agents with such abilities. To this end we implemented a perspective taking task that was inspired by experiments done with chimpanzees. We show that agents controlled by artificial neural networks can learn via reinforcement learning to pass simple tests that require perspective taking capabilities. In particular, this ability is more readily learned when the agent has allocentric information about the objects in the environment. Building artificial agents with perspective taking ability will help to reverse engineer how computations underlying theory of mind might be accomplished in our brains.
