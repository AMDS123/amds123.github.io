##### Abstract
This is an opinion paper about the strengths and weaknesses of Deep Nets. They are at the center of recent progress on Artificial Intelligence and are of growing importance in Cognitive Science and Neuroscience since they enable the development of computational models that can deal with a large range of visually realistic stimuli and visual tasks. They have clear limitations but they also have enormous successes. There is also gradual, though incomplete, understanding of their inner workings. It seems unlikely that Deep Nets in their current form will be the best long-term solution either for building general purpose intelligent machines or for understanding the mind/brain, but it is likely that many aspects of them will remain. At present Deep Nets do very well on specific types of visual tasks and on specific benchmarked datasets. But Deep Nets are much less general purpose, flexible, and adaptive than the human visual system. Moreover, methods like Deep Nets may run into fundamental difficulties when faced with the enormous complexity of natural images. To illustrate our main points, while keeping the references small, this paper is slightly biased towards work from our group.

##### Abstract (translated by Google)
这是一个关于深网的优点和缺点的观点文章。它们是人工智能近期发展的中心，在认知科学和神经科学方面越来越重要，因为它们能够开发可处理大量视觉逼真刺激和视觉任务的计算模型。他们有明确的限制，但他们也有巨大的成功。对其内部运作也有渐进的，但不完整的理解。目前的Deep Nets似乎不太可能成为构建通用智能机器或理解思维/大脑的最佳长期解决方案，但很可能这些解决方案的许多方面仍将存在。目前，Deep Net在特定类型的视觉任务和特定基准数据集方面做得非常好。但Deep Net与人类视觉系统相比，具有更少的通用性，灵活性和适应性。而且，像Deep Nets这样的方法在遇到复杂的自然图像时可能会遇到根本性的困难。为了说明我们的主要观点，在保持参考文献较小的同时，本文略微偏向我们团队的工作。
