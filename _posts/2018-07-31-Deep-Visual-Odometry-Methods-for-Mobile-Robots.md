##### Abstract
Technology has made navigation in 3D real time possible and this has made possible what seemed impossible. This paper explores the aspect of deep visual odometry methods for mobile robots. Visual odometry has been instrumental in making this navigation successful. Noticeable challenges in mobile robots including the inability to attain Simultaneous Localization and Mapping have been solved by visual odometry through its cameras which are suitable for human environments. More intuitive, precise and accurate detection have been made possible by visual odometry in mobile robots. Another challenge in the mobile robot world is the 3D map reconstruction for exploration. A dense map in mobile robots can facilitate for localization and more accurate findings.
