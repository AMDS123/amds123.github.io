##### Abstract
We replicate a variation of the image captioning architecture by Vinyals et al. (2015), then introduce dropout during inference mode to simulate the effects of neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Wernicke's aphasia (WA). We evaluate the effects of dropout on language production by measuring the KL-divergence of word frequency distributions and other linguistic metrics as dropout is added. We find that the generated sentences most closely approximate the word frequency distribution of the training corpus when using a moderate dropout of 0.4 during inference.
