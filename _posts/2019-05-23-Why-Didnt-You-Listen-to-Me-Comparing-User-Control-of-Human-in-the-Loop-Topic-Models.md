##### Abstract
To address the lack of comparative evaluation of Human-in-the-Loop Topic Modeling (HLTM) systems, we implement and evaluate three contrasting HLTM approaches using simulation experiments. These approaches are based on previously proposed frameworks, including constraints and informed prior-based methods. User control is desired, so we propose a control metric to measure whether refinement operations are applied as users expect. Informed prior-based methods provide better control than constraints, but constraints yield higher quality topics.
