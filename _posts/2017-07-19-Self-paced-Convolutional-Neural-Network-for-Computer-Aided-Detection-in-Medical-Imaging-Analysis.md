##### Abstract
Tissue characterization has long been an important component of Computer Aided Diagnosis (CAD) systems for automatic lesion detection and further clinical planning. Motivated by the superior performance of deep learning methods on various computer vision problems, there has been increasing work applying deep learning to medical image analysis. However, the development of a robust and reliable deep learning model for computer-aided diagnosis is still highly challenging due to the combination of the high heterogeneity in the medical images and the relative lack of training samples. Specifically, annotation and labeling of the medical images is much more expensive and time-consuming than other applications and often involves manual labor from multiple domain experts. In this work, we propose a multi-stage, self-paced learning framework utilizing a convolutional neural network (CNN) to classify Computed Tomography (CT) image patches. The key contribution of this approach is that we augment the size of training samples by refining the unlabeled instances with a self-paced learning CNN. By implementing the framework on high performance computing servers including the NVIDIA DGX1 machine, we obtained the experimental result, showing that the self-pace boosted network consistently outperformed the original network even with very scarce manual labels. The performance gain indicates that applications with limited training samples such as medical image analysis can benefit from using the proposed framework.

长期以来，组织表征一直是计算机辅助诊断（CAD）系统的重要组成部分，用于自动病变检测和进一步的临床计划。受各种计算机视觉问题的深度学习方法的卓越性能的启发，将深度学习应用于医学图像分析的工作越来越多。然而，由于医学图像的高度异质性和训练样本的相对缺乏，对于计算机辅助诊断的稳健可靠的深度学习模型的发展仍然非常具有挑战性。具体而言，医学图像的注释和标签比其他应用更加昂贵和耗时，并且通常涉及来自多个领域专家的手工劳动。在这项工作中，我们提出了一个利用卷积神经网络（CNN）对计算机断层扫描（CT）图像补丁进行分类的多阶段自学习学习框架。这种方法的主要贡献在于我们通过使用自我学习的CNN提炼未标记的实例来增加训练样本的规模。通过在包括NVIDIA DGX1机器的高性能计算服务器上实施该框架，我们获得了实验结果，表明即使使用非常稀少的手动标签，自我步伐提升网络也始终优于原始网络。性能增益表明，具有有限培训样本的应用程序（如医学图像分析）可以从使用所提议的框架中受益。
