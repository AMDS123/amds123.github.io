##### Abstract
Process analytics involves a sophisticated layer of data analytics built over the traditional notion of process mining. The flexible execution of business process instances involves multiple critical decisions including what task to perform next and what resources to allocate to a task. In this paper, we explore the application of deep learning techniques for solving various process analytics related problems. Based on recent advances in the field we specifically look at memory-augmented neural networks (MANN)s and adapt the latest model to date, namely the Differential Neural Computer. We introduce two modifications to account for a variety of tasks in predictive process analytics: (i) separating the encoding phase and decoding phase, resulting dual controllers, one for each phase; (ii) implementing a write-protected policy for the memory during the decoding phase. We demonstrate the feasibility and usefulness of our approach by solving a number of common process analytics tasks such as next activity prediction, time to completion and suffix prediction. We also introduce the notion of MANN based process analytics recommendation machinery that once deployed can serve as an effective business process recommendation engine enabling organizations to answer various prescriptive process analytics related questions.Using real-world datasets, we benchmark our results against those obtained from the state-of-art methods. We show that MANNs based process analytics methods can acheive state-of-the-art performance and have a lot of value to offer for enterprise specific process anlaytics applications.
