##### Abstract
Visual recognition systems mounted on autonomous moving agents face the challenge of unconstrained data, but simultaneously have the opportunity to improve their performance by moving to acquire new views of test data. In this work, we first show how a recurrent neural network-based system may be trained to perform end-to-end learning of motion policies suited for this "active recognition" setting. Further, we hypothesize that active vision requires an agent to have the capacity to reason about the effects of its motions on its view of the world. To verify this hypothesis, we attempt to induce this capacity in our active recognition pipeline, by simultaneously learning to forecast the effects of the agent's motions on its internal representation of the environment conditional on all past views. Results across two challenging datasets confirm both that our end-to-end system successfully learns meaningful policies for active category recognition, and that "learning to look ahead" further boosts recognition performance.

安装在自主移动代理上的视觉识别系统面临着不受约束的数据的挑战，但同时有机会通过移动获取测试数据的新视图来提高其性能。在这项工作中，我们首先展示了一个循环的神经网络系统如何进行训练，以执行适合于这种“主动识别”设置的运动策略的端到端学习。此外，我们假设积极的愿景要求代理人有能力推理其运动对其世界观的影响。为了验证这个假设，我们试图在我们的主动识别管道中引入这种能力，同时学习以所有过去的观点为条件预测代理人运动对环境内部表示的影响。跨两个具有挑战性的数据集的结果证实，我们的端到端系统成功地学习了用于主动类别识别的有意义的策略，并且“学习展望”进一步提升了识别性能。
