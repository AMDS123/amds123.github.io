##### Abstract
Place classification is a fundamental ability that a robot should possess to carry out effective human-robot interactions. It is a nontrivial classification problem which has attracted many research. In recent years, there is a high exploitation of Artificial Intelligent algorithms in robotics applications. Inspired by the recent successes of deep learning methods, we propose an end-to-end learning approach for the place classification problem. With the deep architectures, this methodology automatically discovers features and contributes in general to higher classification accuracies. The pipeline of our approach is composed of three parts. Firstly, we construct multiple layers of laser range data to represent the environment information in different levels of granularity. Secondly, each layer of data is fed into a deep neural network model for classification, where a graph regularization is imposed to the deep architecture for keeping local consistency between adjacent samples. Finally, the predicted labels obtained from all the layers are fused based on confidence trees to maximize the overall confidence. Experimental results validate the effective- ness of our end-to-end place classification framework in which both the multi-layer structure and the graph regularization promote the classification performance. Furthermore, results show that the features automatically learned from the raw input range data can achieve competitive results to the features constructed based on statistical and geometrical information.

位置分类是机器人应具有的执行有效的人机交互的基本能力。这是一个非平凡的分类问题，吸引了许多研究。近年来，人工智能算法在机器人应用中有很高的利用率。受近期深度学习方法的成功启发，我们提出了一种端到端的学习方法来处理地点分类问题。通过深层次的架构，这种方法可以自动发现特征，并且可以提高分类的准确性。我们的方法的管道由三部分组成。首先，我们构建了多层激光测距数据来表示不同粒度的环境信息。其次，将每层数据输入到深度神经网络模型进行分类，在深层结构中采用图形正则化来保持相邻样本之间的局部一致性。最后，从所有层获得的预测标签基于置信度树进行融合，以最大化整体置信度。实验结果验证了我们的端到端场所分类框架的有效性，其中多层结构和图正则化都促进了分类性能。此外，结果表明，从原始输入范围数据自动学习的特征可以对基于统计和几何信息构造的特征实现有竞争力的结果。
