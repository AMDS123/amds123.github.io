##### Abstract
Melanoma is amongst most aggressive types of cancer. However, it is highly curable if detected in its early stages. Prescreening of suspicious moles and lesions for malignancy is of great importance. Detection can be done by images captured by standard cameras, which are more preferable due to low cost and availability. One important step in computerized evaluation of skin lesions is accurate detection of lesion region, i.e. segmentation of an image into two regions as lesion and normal skin. Accurate segmentation can be challenging due to burdens such as illumination variation and low contrast between lesion and healthy skin. In this paper, a method based on deep neural networks is proposed for accurate extraction of a lesion region. The input image is preprocessed and then its patches are fed to a convolutional neural network (CNN). Local texture and global structure of the patches are processed in order to assign pixels to lesion or normal classes. A method for effective selection of training patches is used for more accurate detection of a lesion border. The output segmentation mask is refined by some post processing operations. The experimental results of qualitative and quantitative evaluations demonstrate that our method can outperform other state-of-the-art algorithms exist in the literature.

黑色素瘤是最具侵袭性的癌症类型之一。但是，如果在早期阶段就发现它是非常可治愈的。对可疑的痣和恶性病变进行预先筛查是非常重要的。检测可以通过由标准相机捕获的图像来完成，由于成本低和可用性，这是更优选的。计算机评估皮肤病变的一个重要步骤是准确检测病变区域，即将图像分割成两个区域作为病灶和正常皮肤。准确的分割可能是由于诸如光照变化和病变与健康皮肤之间的低对比度等负担而具有挑战性的。本文提出了一种基于深度神经网络的方法来精确提取病变区域。对输入图像进行预处理，然后将其补丁送入卷积神经网络（CNN）。对贴图的局部纹理和全局结构进行处理，以便将像素分配给病变或正常的类。使用有效选择训练贴片的方法来更准确地检测病变边界。输出分段掩码由一些后处理操作来改进。定性和定量评估的实验结果表明，我们的方法可以超越文献中存在的其他最先进的算法。
