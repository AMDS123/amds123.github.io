##### Abstract
Recognizing facial expression in a wild setting has remained a challenging task in computer vision. The World Wide Web is a good source of facial images which most of them are captured in uncontrolled conditions. In fact, the Internet is a Word Wild Web of facial images with expressions. This paper presents the results of a new study on collecting, annotating, and analyzing wild facial expressions from the web. Three search engines were queried using 1250 emotion related keywords in six different languages and the retrieved images were mapped by two annotators to six basic expressions and neutral. Deep neural networks and noise modeling were used in three different training scenarios to find how accurately facial expressions can be recognized when trained on noisy images collected from the web using query terms (e.g. happy face, laughing man, etc)? The results of our experiments show that deep neural networks can recognize wild facial expressions with an accuracy of 82.12%.

在野外环境中识别面部表情在计算机视觉中仍然是一个具有挑战性的任务。万维网是面部图像的一个很好的来源，其中大部分是在不受控制的条件下捕捉的。事实上，互联网是一个带有表情的面部图像的Word Wild Web。本文介绍了一个从网上收集，注释和分析野生面部表情的新研究结果。用6种不同语言的1250个情感相关关键词查询了三个搜索引擎，并将检索到的图像用两个注释器映射为六个基本表达式和中性。在三种不同的训练场景中，使用深度神经网络和噪声建模来发现在使用查询术语（例如笑脸，笑人等）从网络收集的有噪图像训练时，如何准确地识别面部表情？我们的实验结果表明，深度神经网络可以识别野生面部表情，准确率为82.12％。
