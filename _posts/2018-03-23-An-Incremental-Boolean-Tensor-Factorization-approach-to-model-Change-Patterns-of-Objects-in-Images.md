##### Abstract
Change detection process has recently progressed from a post-classification method to an expert knowledge interpretation process of the time-series data. The technique finds applications mainly in remote sensing images and can be utilized to analyze urbanization and monitor forest regions. In this paper, a framework to perform a knowledge based interpretation of the changes/no changes observed in a spatiotemporal domain using tensor based approaches is presented. An incremental approach to Boolean Tensor Factorization method is proposed in this work, which is adopted to model the change patterns of objects/classes as well as their associated features. The framework is evaluated under different datasets to visualize the performance for the dependency factors. The algorithm is also validated in comparison with the tradition Boolean Tensor Factorization method and the results are substantial.

最近，变更检测处理从时序数据的后分类处理进展到专业知识解释处理。该技术主要用于遥感图像，可用于分析城市化和监测森林区域。在本文中，提出了一个基于张量的方法对基于时空域观察到的变化/无变化进行基于知识的解释的框架。本文提出了一种布尔张量因子分解方法的渐进式方法，该方法被用来模拟对象/类的变化模式及其相关特征。该框架在不同数据集下进行评估，以查看依赖因素的性能。与传统的布尔量子因式分解方法相比，该算法也得到验证，结果非常可观。
