##### Abstract
Detecting and segmenting salient objects in natural scenes, often referred to as salient object detection, has attracted a lot of interest in computer vision. While many models have been proposed and several applications have emerged, yet a deep understanding of achievements and issues is lacking. We aim to provide a comprehensive review of the recent progress in salient object detection and situate this field among other closely related areas such as generic scene segmentation, object proposal generation, and saliency for fixation prediction. Covering 228 publications, we survey i) roots, key concepts, and tasks, ii) core techniques and main modeling trends, and iii) datasets and evaluation metrics in salient object detection. We also discuss open problems such as evaluation metrics and dataset bias in model performance and suggest future research directions.
