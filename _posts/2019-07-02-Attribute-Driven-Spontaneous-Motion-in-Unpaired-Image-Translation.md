##### Abstract
Current image translation methods, albeit effective to produce high-quality results on various applications, still do not consider much geometric transforms. We in this paper propose spontaneous motion estimation module, along with a refinement module, to learn attribute-driven deformation between source and target domains. Extensive experiments and visualization demonstrate effectiveness of these modules. We achieve promising results in unpaired image translation tasks, and enable interesting applications with spontaneous motion basis.
