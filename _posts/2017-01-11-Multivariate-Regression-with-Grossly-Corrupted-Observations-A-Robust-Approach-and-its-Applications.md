##### Abstract
This paper studies the problem of multivariate linear regression where a portion of the observations is grossly corrupted or is missing, and the magnitudes and locations of such occurrences are unknown in priori. To deal with this problem, we propose a new approach by explicitly consider the error source as well as its sparseness nature. An interesting property of our approach lies in its ability of allowing individual regression output elements or tasks to possess their unique noise levels. Moreover, despite working with a non-smooth optimization problem, our approach still guarantees to converge to its optimal solution. Experiments on synthetic data demonstrate the competitiveness of our approach compared with existing multivariate regression models. In addition, empirically our approach has been validated with very promising results on two exemplar real-world applications: The first concerns the prediction of \textit{Big-Five} personality based on user behaviors at social network sites (SNSs), while the second is 3D human hand pose estimation from depth images. The implementation of our approach and comparison methods as well as the involved datasets are made publicly available in support of the open-source and reproducible research initiatives.

本文研究了多元线性回归问题，其中一部分观测值严重受损或缺失，而且这些事件的幅度和位置在先验上是未知的。为了处理这个问题，我们提出了一个新的方法，明确地考虑了误差来源及其稀疏性。我们的方法的一个有趣的特性在于其允许单独的回归输出元素或任务具有其独特的噪音水平的能力。而且，尽管有一个非光滑优化问题，我们的方法仍然保证收敛到最优解。综合数据的实验证明了我们的方法与现有的多元回归模型相比的竞争力。另外，我们的方法在实证上已经在两个示例性实际应用中得到了非常有希望的结果：第一个涉及基于用户在社交网站（SNS）上的行为预测大五人格，第二是从深度图像的3D人手姿态估计。我们的方法和比较方法以及相关数据集的实施将公开发布，以支持开源和可重复的研究举措。
