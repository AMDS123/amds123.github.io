The subject of research is methods and tools for verification of web-members socio-demographic characteristics based on computer-linguistic analysis of their communicative interaction results. The aim of paper is to verifying web-user personal data on the basis of computer-linguistic analysis of web-members information tracks. The structure of verification software for web-user profile is designed for a practical implementation of assigned tasks. The method of personal data verification of web-members by analyzing information track of virtual community member is conducted. For the first time the method for checking the authenticity of web members personal data, which helped to design of verification tool for socio-demographic characteristics of web-member is developed. The verification system of data of web-members, which forms the verified socio-demographic profiles of web-members, is developed as a result of conducted experiments.
