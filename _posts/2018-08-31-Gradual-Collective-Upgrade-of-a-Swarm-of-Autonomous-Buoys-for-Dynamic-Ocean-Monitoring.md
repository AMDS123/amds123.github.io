##### Abstract
Swarms of autonomous surface vehicles equipped with environmental sensors and decentralized communications bring a new wave of attractive possibilities for the monitoring of dynamic features in oceans and other waterbodies. However, a key challenge in swarm robotics design is the efficient collective operation of heterogeneous systems. We present both theoretical analysis and field experiments on the responsiveness in dynamic area coverage of a collective of 22 autonomous buoys, where 4 units are upgraded to a new design that allows them to move 80\% faster than the rest. This system is able to react on timescales of the minute to changes in areas on the order of a few thousand square meters. We have observed that this partial upgrade of the system significantly increases its average responsiveness, without necessarily improving the spatial uniformity of the deployment. These experiments show that the autonomous buoy designs and the cooperative control rule described in this work provide an efficient, flexible, and scalable solution for the pervasive and persistent monitoring of water environments.

成群的自动地面车辆配备了环境传感器和分散通信，为监测海洋和其他水体的动态特征带来了新的吸引力。然而，群体机器人设计中的关键挑战是异构系统的有效集体操作。我们提供了22个自主浮标集合的动态区域覆盖响应性的理论分析和现场实验，其中4个单元升级为新设计，允许它们比其余浮标快80％移动。该系统能够在分钟的时间尺度上对几千平方米的区域的变化作出反应。我们观察到系统的这种部分升级显着提高了其平均响应性，而不一定改善部署的空间一致性。这些实验表明，本工作中描述的自主浮标设计和协同控制规则为水环境的普遍和持续监测提供了一种高效，灵活和可扩展的解决方案。
