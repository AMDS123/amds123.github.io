##### Abstract
Autonomous ground vehicles have been designed for the purpose of that relies on ranging and bearing information received from forward looking camera on the Formation control . A visual guidance control algorithm is designed where real time image processing is used to provide feedback signals. The vision subsystem and control subsystem work in parallel to accomplish formation control. A proportional navigation and line of sight guidance laws are used to estimate the range and bearing information from the leader vehicle using the vision subsystem. The algorithms for vision detection and localization used here are similar to approaches for many computer vision tasks such as face tracking and detection that are based color-and texture based features, and non-parametric Continuously Adaptive Mean-shift algorithms to keep track of the leader. This is being proposed for the first time in the leader follower framework. The algorithms are simple but effective for real time and provide an alternate approach to traditional based approaches like the Viola Jones algorithm. Further to stabilize the follower to the leader trajectory, the sliding mode controller is used to dynamically track the leader. The performance of the results is demonstrated in simulation and in practical experiments.

自主地面车辆的设计目的在于依靠从前视摄像头收到的测距和方位信息来控制编队。设计了一种视觉引导控制算法，其中使用实时图像处理来提供反馈信号。视觉子系统和控制子系统并行工作，完成地层控制。使用比例导航和视线引导法则来使用视觉子系统来估算领导车辆的距离和方位信息。这里使用的视觉检测和定位算法类似于许多计算机视觉任务的方法，例如基于颜色和纹理的特征的面部跟踪和检测，以及跟踪领导者的非参数连续自适应均值移位算法。这是首次在领导者追随者框架中提出的。该算法简单但实时，并提供了一个传统的方法，如中提琴琼斯算法的替代方法。为了使跟随者稳定在领导者轨迹上，滑动模式控制器被用于动态地跟踪领导者。结果的表现在仿真和实际实验中得到了证明。
