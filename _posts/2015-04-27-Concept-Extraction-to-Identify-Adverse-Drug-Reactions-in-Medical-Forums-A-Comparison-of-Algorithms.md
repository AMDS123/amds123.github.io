##### Abstract
Social media is becoming an increasingly important source of information to complement traditional pharmacovigilance methods. In order to identify signals of potential adverse drug reactions, it is necessary to first identify medical concepts in the social media text. Most of the existing studies use dictionary-based methods which are not evaluated independently from the overall signal detection task. We compare different approaches to automatically identify and normalise medical concepts in consumer reviews in medical forums. Specifically, we implement several dictionary-based methods popular in the relevant literature, as well as a method we suggest based on a state-of-the-art machine learning method for entity recognition. MetaMap, a popular biomedical concept extraction tool, is used as a baseline. Our evaluations were performed in a controlled setting on a common corpus which is a collection of medical forum posts annotated with concepts and linked to controlled vocabularies such as MedDRA and SNOMED CT. To our knowledge, our study is the first to systematically examine the effect of popular concept extraction methods in the area of signal detection for adverse reactions. We show that the choice of algorithm or controlled vocabulary has a significant impact on concept extraction, which will impact the overall signal detection process. We also show that our proposed machine learning approach significantly outperforms all the other methods in identification of both adverse reactions and drugs, even when trained with a relatively small set of annotated text.

社交媒体正在成为日益重要的信息来源，以补充传统的药物警戒方法。为了识别潜在的药物不良反应信号，有必要首先确定社交媒体文本中的医学概念。现有的大部分研究都使用基于字典的方法，这些方法不是从整体信号检测任务中独立评估的。我们比较不同的方法来自动识别和规范在医疗论坛消费者评论中的医学概念。具体来说，我们实现了几种在相关文献中流行的基于字典的方法，以及基于最先进的用于实体识别的机器学习方法建议的方法。 MetaMap是一种流行的生物医学概念提取工具，被用作基线。我们的评估是在一个共同语料库的受控环境下进行的，该语料库是一个医学论坛帖子的集合，注释了概念并与受控词汇表（如MedDRA和SNOMED CT）相关联。据我们所知，我们的研究是第一个系统地研究流行的概念提取方法在不良反应信号检测领域的效果。我们发现算法或受控词汇的选择对概念提取有重大影响，这将影响整个信号检测过程。我们还表明，我们提出的机器学习方法明显优于所有其他方法来识别不良反应和药物，甚至在用相对较少的注释文本进行训练时也是如此。
