##### Abstract
We present a novel method to explicitly incorporate topological prior knowledge into deep learning based segmentation, which is, to our knowledge, the first work to do so. Our method uses the concept of persistent homology, a tool from topological data analysis, to capture high-level topological characteristics of segmentation results in a way which is differentiable with respect to the pixelwise probability of being assigned to a given class. The topological prior knowledge consists of the sequence of desired Betti numbers of the segmentation. As a proof-of-concept we demonstrate our approach by applying it to the problem of left-ventricle segmentation of cardiac MR images of 500 subjects from the UK Biobank dataset, where we show that it improves segmentation performance in terms of topological correctness without sacrificing pixelwise accuracy.
