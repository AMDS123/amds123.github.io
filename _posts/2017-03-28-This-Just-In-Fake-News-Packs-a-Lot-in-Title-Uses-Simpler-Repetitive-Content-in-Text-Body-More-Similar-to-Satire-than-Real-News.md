##### Abstract
The problem of fake news has gained a lot of attention as it is claimed to have had a significant impact on 2016 US Presidential Elections. Fake news is not a new problem and its spread in social networks is well-studied. Often an underlying assumption in fake news discussion is that it is written to look like real news, fooling the reader who does not check for reliability of the sources or the arguments in its content. Through a unique study of three data sets and features that capture the style and the language of articles, we show that this assumption is not true. Fake news in most cases is more similar to satire than to real news, leading us to conclude that persuasion in fake news is achieved through heuristics rather than the strength of arguments. We show overall title structure and the use of proper nouns in titles are very significant in differentiating fake from real. This leads us to conclude that fake news is targeted for audiences who are not likely to read beyond titles and is aimed at creating mental associations between entities and claims.

假新闻问题引起了很多关注，据称对2016年美国总统选举产生了重大影响。假新闻不是一个新问题，它在社交网络上的传播已经被充分研究。假新闻讨论中的一个基本假设是，它被写成看起来像是真实的新闻，欺骗不检查信息来源的可靠性或其内容中的论据的读者。通过对捕捉文章风格和语言的三个数据集和特征的独特研究，我们证明这个假设是不正确的。在大多数情况下，假新闻更像讽刺，而不是真实新闻，导致我们得出的结论是，假新闻的说服是通过启发式而不是争论的力量来实现的。我们展示整体标题结构，在标题中使用专有名词对区分假冒和真实非常重要。这导致我们得出这样的结论：假消息是针对那些不太可能超越标题的读者，并且旨在创造实体与主张之间的心理联想。
