##### Abstract
Domain adaptation aims to assist the modeling tasks of the target domain with knowledge of the source domain. The two domains often lie in different feature spaces due to diverse data collection methods, which leads to the more challenging task of heterogeneous domain adaptation (HDA). A core issue of HDA is how to preserve the information of the original data during adaptation. In this paper, we propose a joint information preservation method to deal with the problem. The method preserves the information of the original data from two aspects. On the one hand, although paired samples often exist between the two domains of the HDA, current algorithms do not utilize such information sufficiently. The proposed method preserves the paired information by maximizing the correlation of the paired samples in the shared subspace. On the other hand, the proposed method improves the strategy of preserving the structural information of the original data, where the local and global structural information are preserved simultaneously. Finally, the joint information preservation is integrated by distribution matching. Experimental results show the superiority of the proposed method over the state-of-the-art HDA algorithms.
