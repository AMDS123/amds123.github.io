##### Abstract
The problem of collecting reliable estimates of occurrence of entities on the open web forms the premise for this report. The models learned for tagging entities cannot be expected to perform well when deployed on the web. This is owing to the severe mismatch in the distributions of such entities on the web and in the relatively diminutive training data. In this report, we build up the case for maximum mean discrepancy for estimation of occurrence statistics of entities on the web, taking a review of named entity disambiguation techniques and related concepts along the way.

收集开放网络上实体发生的可靠估计的问题是本报告的前提。学习标记实体的模型不能期望在网络上部署时表现良好。这是由于这些实体在网络上的分布严重不匹配以及相对较小的培训数据。在本报告中，我们构建了网络实体发生统计估计的最大均值差异情况，并对沿途命名实体消歧技术及相关概念进行了回顾。
