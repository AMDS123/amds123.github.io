##### Abstract
We present a neural model for morphological inflection generation which employs a hard attention mechanism, inspired by the nearly-monotonic alignment commonly found between the characters in a word and the characters in its inflection. We evaluate the model on three previously studied morphological inflection generation datasets and show that it provides state of the art results in various setups compared to previous neural and non-neural approaches. Finally we present an analysis of the continuous representations learned by both the hard and soft attention \cite{bahdanauCB14} models for the task, shedding some light on the features such models extract.

我们提出了一个神经模型的形态拐点生成，采用了一个硬注意机制，灵感来自一个单词中的字符和其变形字符之间通常发现的近单调的对齐。我们在三个先前研究过的形态学拐点生成数据集上评估模型，并证明它与以前的神经和非神经方法相比在各种设置中提供了最先进的结果。最后，我们分析了硬性和软性注意\ bitedanau \ CB14}模型对于任务学习的连续表征，揭示了模型提取的特征。
