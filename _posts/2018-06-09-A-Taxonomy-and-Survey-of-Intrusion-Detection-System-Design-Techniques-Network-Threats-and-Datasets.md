##### Abstract
With the world moving towards being increasingly dependent on computers and automation, one of the main challenges in the current decade has been to build secure applications, systems and networks. Alongside these challenges, the number of threats is rising exponentially due to the attack surface increasing through numerous interfaces offered for each service. To alleviate the impact of these threats, researchers have proposed numerous solutions; however, current tools often fail to adapt to ever-changing architectures, associated threats and 0-days. This manuscript aims to provide researchers with a taxonomy and survey of current dataset composition and current Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) capabilities and assets. These taxonomies and surveys aim to improve both the efficiency of IDS and the creation of datasets to build the next generation IDS as well as to reflect networks threats more accurately in future datasets. To this end, this manuscript also provides a taxonomy and survey or network threats and associated tools. The manuscript highlights that current IDS only cover 25% of our threat taxonomy, while current datasets demonstrate clear lack of real-network threats and attack representation, but rather include a large number of deprecated threats, hence limiting the accuracy of current machine learning IDS. Moreover, the taxonomies are open-sourced to allow public contributions through a Github repository.

随着世界越来越依赖计算机和自动化，当前十年的主要挑战之一是建立安全的应用程序，系统和网络。除了这些挑战之外，由于通过为每项服务提供的众多接口增加攻击面，因此威胁的数量呈指数级增长。为了缓解这些威胁的影响，研究人员提出了许多解决方案;然而，目前的工具往往无法适应不断变化的架构，相关的威胁和0天。本手稿旨在为研究人员提供当前数据集组合和当前入侵检测系统（IDS）功能和资产的分类和调查。这些分类法和调查旨在提高IDS的效率和创建数据集以构建下一代IDS，并在未来的数据集中更准确地反映网络威胁。为此，该手稿还提供了分类和调查或网络威胁及相关工具。该手稿强调，目前的IDS只覆盖了我们威胁分类法的25％，而目前的数据集显示明显缺乏实际网络威胁和攻击表示，但包含大量不推荐使用的威胁，因此限制了当前机器学习IDS的准确性。此外，分类标准是开源的，可以通过Github存储库提供公共贡献。
