##### Abstract
We propose a direct-to-word sequence model with a dynamic lexicon. Our word network constructs word embeddings dynamically from the character level tokens. The word network can be integrated seamlessly with arbitrary sequence models including Connectionist Temporal Classification and encoder-decoder models with attention. Sub-word units are commonly used in speech recognition yet are generated without the use of acoustic context. We show our direct-to-word model can achieve word error rate gains over sub-word level models for speech recognition. Furthermore, we empirically validate that the word-level embeddings we learn contain significant acoustic information, making them more suitable for use in speech recognition. We also show that our direct-to-word approach retains the ability to predict words not seen at training time without any retraining.
