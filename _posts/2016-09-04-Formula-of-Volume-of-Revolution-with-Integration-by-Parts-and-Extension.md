##### Abstract
A calculation formula of volume of revolution with integration by parts of definite integral is derived based on monotone function, and extended to a general case that curved trapezoids is determined by continuous, piecewise strictly monotone and differential function. And, two examples are given, ones curvilinear trapezoids is determined by Kepler equation, and the other curvilinear trapezoids is a function transmuted from Kepler equation.
