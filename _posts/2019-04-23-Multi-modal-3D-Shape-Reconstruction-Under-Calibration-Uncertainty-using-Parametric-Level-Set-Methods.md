##### Abstract
We consider the problem of 3D shape reconstruction from multi-modal data, given uncertain calibration parameters. Typically, 3D data modalities can be in diverse forms such as sparse point sets, volumetric slices, 2D photos and so on. To jointly process these data modalities, we exploit a parametric level set method that utilizes ellipsoidal radial basis functions. This method not only allows us to analytically and compactly represent the object, it also confers on us the ability to overcome calibration related noise that originates from inaccurate acquisition parameters. This essentially implicit regularization leads to a highly robust and scalable reconstruction, surpassing other traditional methods. In our results we first demonstrate the ability of the method to compactly represent complex objects. We then show that our reconstruction method is robust both to a small number of measurements and to noise in the acquisition parameters. Finally, we demonstrate our reconstruction abilities from diverse modalities such as volume slices obtained from liquid displacement (similar to CTscans and XRays), and visual measurements obtained from shape silhouettes.
