##### Abstract
Non-zero diffusion particle flow Sequential Monte Carlo probability hypothesis density (NPF-SMC-PHD) filtering has been recently introduced for multi-speaker tracking. However, the NPF does not consider the missing detection which plays a key role in estimation of the number of speakers with their states. To address this limitation, we propose to use intensity particle flow (IPF) in NPFSMC-PHD filter. The proposed method, IPF-SMC-PHD, considers the clutter intensity and detection probability while no data association algorithms are used for the calculation of particle flow. Experiments on the LOCATA (acoustic source Localization and Tracking) dataset with the sequences of task 4 show that our proposed IPF-SMC-PHD filter improves the tracking performance in terms of estimation accuracy as compared to its baseline counterparts.
