##### Abstract
Intelligent personal assistant systems, with either text-based or voice-based conversational interfaces, are becoming increasingly popular. Most previous research has used either retrieval-based or generation-based methods. Retrieval-based methods have the advantage of returning fluent and informative responses with great diversity. The retrieved responses are easier to control and explain. However, the response retrieval performance is limited by the size of the response repository. On the other hand, although generation-based methods can return highly coherent responses given conversation context, they are likely to return universal or general responses with insufficient ground knowledge information. In this paper, we build a hybrid neural conversation model with the capability of both response retrieval and generation, in order to combine the merits of these two types of methods. Experimental results on Twitter and Foursquare data show that the proposed model can outperform both retrieval-based methods and generation-based methods (including a recently proposed knowledge-grounded neural conversation model) under both automatic evaluation metrics and human evaluation. Our models and research findings provide new insights on how to integrate text retrieval and text generation models for building conversation systems.
