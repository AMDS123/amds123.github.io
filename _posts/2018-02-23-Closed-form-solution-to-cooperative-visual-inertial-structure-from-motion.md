##### Abstract
This paper considers the problem of visual-inertial sensor fusion in the cooperative case and it provides new theoretical contributions, which regard its observability and its resolvability in closed form. The case of two agents is investigated. Each agent is equipped with inertial sensors (accelerometer and gyroscope) and with a monocular camera. By using the monocular camera, each agent can observe the other agent. No additional camera observations (e.g., of external point features in the environment) are considered. All the inertial sensors are assumed to be affected by a bias. First, the entire observable state is analytically derived. This state includes the absolute scale, the relative velocity between the two agents, the three Euler angles that express the rotation between the two agent frames and all the accelerometer and gyroscope biases. Second, the paper provides the extension of the closed-form solution given in [19] (which holds for a single agent) to the aforementioned cooperative case. The impact of the presence of the bias on the performance of this closed-form solution is investigated. As in the case of a single agent, this performance is significantly sensitive to the presence of a bias on the gyroscope, while, the presence of a bias on the accelerometer is negligible. Finally, a simple and effective method to obtain the gyroscope bias is proposed. Extensive simulations clearly show that the proposed method is successful. It is amazing that, it is possible to automatically retrieve the absolute scale and simultaneously calibrate the gyroscopes not only without any prior knowledge (as in [13]), but also without external point features in the environment.

本文考虑了合作案例中视觉 - 惯性传感器融合的问题，并提供了新的理论贡献，其关于其可观性及其可解性的封闭形式提供了新的理论贡献。调查了两种药物的情况。每个代理都配备惯性传感器（加速度计和陀螺仪）和单眼相机。通过使用单眼相机，每个代理可以观察其他代理。不考虑额外的摄像机观察（例如环境中的外部点特征）。假设所有的惯性传感器都受到偏差的影响。首先，整个可观察状态是分析导出的。该状态包括绝对尺度，两个代理之间的相对速度，表示两个代理帧之间的旋转的三个欧拉角以及所有加速度计和陀螺仪偏差。其次，本文将[19]中给出的封闭形式解决方案（适用于单一代理人）扩展到上述合作案例。研究了偏置的存在对这种封闭式解决方案性能的影响。与单个代理的情况一样，这种性能对陀螺仪上的偏差存在显着敏感，而加速度计上的偏差可以忽略不计。最后，提出了一种简单有效的获得陀螺偏置的方法。广泛的模拟清楚地表明，所提出的方法是成功的。令人惊讶的是，有可能自动检索绝对尺度并且同时校准陀螺仪不仅没有任何先验知识（如在[13]中），而且在环境中没有外部点特征。
