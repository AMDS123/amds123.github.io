##### Abstract
Ultrasound (US) is the most commonly used liver imaging modality worldwide. Due to its low cost, it is increasingly used in the follow-up of cancer patients with metastases localized in the liver. In this contribution, we present the results of an interactive segmentation approach for liver metastases in US acquisitions. A (semi-) automatic segmentation is still very challenging because of the low image quality and the low contrast between the metastasis and the surrounding liver tissue. Thus, the state of the art in clinical practice is still manual measurement and outlining of the metastases in the US images. We tackle the problem by providing an interactive segmentation approach providing real-time feedback of the segmentation results. The approach has been evaluated with typical US acquisitions from the clinical routine, and the datasets consisted of pancreatic cancer metastases. Even for difficult cases, satisfying segmentations results could be achieved because of the interactive real-time behavior of the approach. In total, 40 clinical images have been evaluated with our method by comparing the results against manual ground truth segmentations. This evaluation yielded to an average Dice Score of 85% and an average Hausdorff Distance of 13 pixels.

超声（US）是全世界最常用的肝脏成像模式。由于其成本低，因此越来越多地用于肝转移癌症患者的随访。在这项贡献中，我们介绍了在美国收购中肝转移的交互式分割方法的结果。由于图像质量低和转移与周围肝组织之间的低对比度，（半）自动分割仍然是非常具有挑战性的。因此，临床实践中的技术水平仍然是人工测量和概述美国图像中的转移。我们通过提供交互式分割方法来解决问题，提供分割结果的实时反馈。该方法已经通过美国典型的临床常规采集进行了评估，数据集包括胰腺癌转移。即使在困难的情况下，由于该方法的交互式实时行为，也可以实现满足分割结果。总的来说，我们的方法通过比较结果与手动地面真实分割评估了40张临床图像。这个评估得出的平均骰子分数为85％，平均Hausdorff距离为13个像素。
