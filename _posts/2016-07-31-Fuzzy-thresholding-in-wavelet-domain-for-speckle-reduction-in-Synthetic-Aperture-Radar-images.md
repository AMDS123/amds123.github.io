##### Abstract
The application of wavelet transforms to Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imagery has improved despeckling performance. To deduce the problem of filtering the multiplicative noise to the case of an additive noise, the wavelet decomposition is performed on the logarithm of the image gray levels. The detail coefficients produced by the bidimensional discrete wavelet transform (DWT-2D) needs to be thresholded to extract out the speckle in highest subbands. An initial threshold value is estimated according to the noise variance. In this paper, an additional fuzzy thresholding approach for automatic determination of the rate threshold level around the traditional wavelet noise thresholding (initial threshold) is applied, and used for the soft or hard-threshold performed on all the high frequency subimages. The filtered logarithmic image is then obtained by reconstruction from the thresholded coefficients. This process is applied a single time, and exclusively to the first level of decomposition. The exponential function of this reconstructed image gives the final filtered image. Experimental results on test images have demonstrated the effectiveness of this method compared to the most of methods in use at the moment.

小波变换在合成孔径雷达（SAR）图像中的应用提高了去斑的性能。为了推导将相乘噪声滤波为加性噪声的问题，对图像灰度级的对数进行小波分解。需要对二维离散小波变换（DWT-2D）产生的细节系数进行阈值化处理，以提取出最高子带的散斑。根据噪声方差来估计初始阈值。本文采用了一种附加的模糊阈值方法来自动确定传统小波噪声阈值（初始阈值）附近的速率阈值水平，并用于所有高频子图像上的软阈值或硬阈值。滤波的对数图像然后通过从阈值系数重构获得。这个过程是一次性应用的，专门用于第一级分解。这个重建图像的指数函数给出了最终的滤波图像。测试图像的实验结果表明，与目前使用的大多数方法相比，该方法的有效性。
