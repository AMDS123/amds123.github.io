##### Abstract
Binary classification is one of the most common problem in machine learning. It consists in predicting whether a given element is of a particular class. In this paper, a new algorithm for binary classification is proposed using a hypergraph representation. Each element to be classified is partitioned according to its interactions with the training set. For each class, the total support is calculated as a convex combination of the {\it evidence} strength of the element of the partition. The evidence measure is pre-computed using the hypergraph induced by the training set and iteratively adjusted through a training phase. It does not require structured information, each case being represented by a set of {\it agnostic information} atoms. Empirical validation demonstrates its high potential on a wide range of well-known datasets and the results are compared to the state-of-art. The time complexity is given and empirically validated. Its capacity to provide good performances without hyperparameter tuning compared to standard classification methods is studied. Finally, the limitation of the model space is discussed and some potential solutions proposed.

二进制分类是机器学习中最常见的问题之一。它包括预测给定元素是否属于特定类。在本文中，提出了一种使用超图表示的二元分类新算法。每个要分类的元素根据其与训练集的交互进行划分。对于每个类，总支持计算为分区元素的{\ it证据}强度的凸组合。证据测量是使用由训练集引起的超图预先计算的并且通过训练阶段进行迭代调整。它不需要结构化信息，每种情况都由一组{\ it不可知信息}原子表示。经验验证证明了它在广泛的众所周知的数据集上的高潜力，并将结果与​​最先进的数据进行比较。时间复杂性给出并经验证实。研究了与标准分类方法相比，其无需超参数调整即可提供良好性能的能力。最后讨论了模型空间的局限性，提出了一些可能的解决方案。
