##### Abstract
Robust visual place recognition (VPR) requires scene representations that are invariant to various environmental challenges such as seasonal changes and variations due to ambient lighting conditions during day and night. Moreover, a practical VPR system necessitates compact representations of environmental features. To satisfy these requirements, in this paper we suggest a modification to the existing pipeline of VPR systems to incorporate supervised hashing. The modified system learns (in a supervised setting) compact binary codes from image feature descriptors. These binary codes imbibe robustness to the visual variations exposed to it during the training phase, thereby, making the system adaptive to severe environmental changes. Also, incorporating supervised hashing makes VPR computationally more efficient and easy to implement on simple hardware. This is because binary embeddings can be learned over simple-to-compute features and the distance computation is also in the low-dimensional hamming space of binary codes. We have performed experiments on several challenging data sets covering seasonal, illumination and viewpoint variations. We also compare two widely used supervised hashing methods of CCAITQ and MLH and show that this new pipeline out-performs or closely matches the state-of-the-art deep learning VPR methods that are based on high-dimensional features extracted from pre-trained deep convolutional neural networks.

强大的视觉位置识别（VPR）要求场景表示不受各种环境挑战的影响，如白天和夜晚环境照明条件下的季节变化和变化。而且，实际的VPR系统需要紧凑的环境特征表示。为了满足这些要求，在本文中，我们建议对VPR系统的现有流水线进行修改以包含监督哈希。修改的系统从图像特征描述符中学习（在监督设置中）紧凑的二进制码。这些二进制代码在训练阶段吸收了暴露给它的视觉变化的鲁棒性，从而使系统适应严重的环境变化。此外，结合监督散列使得VPR在计算上更加高效，易于在简单的硬件上实现。这是因为可以通过简单计算特征来学习二进制嵌入，并且距离计算也在二进制码的低维汉明空间中。我们已经对几个具有挑战性的数据集进行了实验，包括季节，照明和视点变化我们还比较了CCAITQ和MLH两种广泛使用的监督散列方法，并证明这种新的管道能够超越或紧密匹配基于从预训练中提取的高维特征的最先进的深度学习VPR方法深卷积神经网络。
