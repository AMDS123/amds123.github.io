##### Abstract
Machine translation is the discipline concerned with developing automated tools for translating from one human language to another. Statistical machine translation (SMT) is the dominant paradigm in this field. In SMT, translations are generated by means of statistical models whose parameters are learned from bilingual data. Scalability is a key concern in SMT, as one would like to make use of as much data as possible to train better translation systems. In recent years, mobile devices with adequate computing power have become widely available. Despite being very successful, mobile applications relying on NLP systems continue to follow a client-server architecture, which is of limited use because access to internet is often limited and expensive. The goal of this dissertation is to show how to construct a scalable machine translation system that can operate with the limited resources available on a mobile device. The main challenge for porting translation systems on mobile devices is memory usage. The amount of memory available on a mobile device is far less than what is typically available on the server side of a client-server application. In this thesis, we investigate alternatives for the two components which prevent standard translation systems from working on mobile devices due to high memory usage. We show that once these standard components are replaced with our proposed alternatives, we obtain a scalable translation system that can work on a device with limited memory.

机器翻译是与开发自动化工具从一种人类语言翻译到另一种有关的学科。统计机器翻译（SMT）是这个领域的主要范式。在SMT中，翻译是通过从双语数据中学习参数的统计模型生成的。可伸缩性是SMT中的一个关键问题，因为人们希望尽可能多地利用数据来训练更好的翻译系统。近年来，具有足够计算能力的移动设备已经被广泛使用。尽管非常成功，但依赖于NLP系统的移动应用程序仍然遵循客户端 - 服务器架构，因为访问互联网往往是有限和昂贵的，所以这种架构使用有限。本文的目标是展示如何构建一个可以在移动设备上有限的资源下运行的可扩展的机器翻译系统。在移动设备上移植翻译系统的主要挑战是内存使用。移动设备上的可用内存量远远小于客户端 - 服务器应用程序服务器端通常可用的内存量。在这篇论文中，我们研究了两个组件的替代方案，这两个组件由于内存使用率高而阻碍了标准翻译系统在移动设备上的工作我们表明，一旦这些标准组件被替换为我们提出的替代方案，我们将获得一个可扩展的翻译系统，可以在有限内存的设备上工作。
