##### Abstract
A visual-relational knowledge graph (KG) is a multi-relational graph whose entities are associated with images. We introduce ImageGraph, a KG with 1,330 relation types, 14,870 entities, and 829,931 images. Visual-relational KGs lead to novel probabilistic query types where images are treated as first-class citizens. Both the prediction of relations between unseen images and multi-relational image retrieval can be formulated as query types in a visual-relational KG. We approach the problem of answering such queries with a novel combination of deep convolutional networks and models for learning knowledge graph embeddings. The resulting models can answer queries such as "How are these two unseen images related to each other?" We also explore a zero-shot learning scenario where an image of an entirely new entity is linked with multiple relations to entities of an existing KG. The multi-relational grounding of unseen entity images into a knowledge graph serves as the description of such an entity. We conduct experiments to demonstrate that the proposed deep architectures in combination with KG embedding objectives can answer the visual-relational queries efficiently and accurately.

视觉关系知识图（KG）是一个多关系图，其实体与图像相关联。我们介绍ImageGraph，一个有1,330个关系类型的KG，14,870个实体和829,931个图像。视觉关系KG导致将图像视为一等公民的新型概率查询类型。预测未看到的图像和多关系图像检索之间的关系可以被制定为视觉关系KG中的查询类型。我们采用深度卷积网络和用于学习知识图嵌入的模型的新颖组合来处理回答这些查询的问题。由此产生的模型可以回答诸如“这两个看不见的图像彼此相关的图像怎么样？”等查询。我们还探索了一个零射击的学习场景，其中一个全新实体的图像与现有KG的实体有多重关系。看不见的实体图像与知识图形的多关系作为这种实体的描述。我们进行实验来证明所提出的与KG嵌入目标相结合的深层体系结构可以有效且准确地回答视觉关系查询。
