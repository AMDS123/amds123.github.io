##### Abstract
Numerous audio systems for musicians are expensive and bulky. Therefore, it could be advantageous to model them and to replace them by computer emulation. In guitar players' world, audio systems could have a desirable nonlinear behavior (distortion effects). It is thus difficult to find a simple model to emulate them in real time. Volterra series model and its subclass are usual ways to model nonlinear systems. Unfortunately, these systems are difficult to identify in an analytic way. In this paper we propose to take advantage of the new progress made in neural networks to emulate them in real time. We show that an accurate emulation can be reached with less than 1% of root mean square error between the signal coming from a tube amplifier and the output of the neural network. Moreover, the research has been extended to model the Gain parameter of the amplifier.

许多用于音乐家的音频系统都很昂贵且笨重。因此，建模它们并用计算机仿真来替代它们可能是有利的。在吉他手的世界中，音频系统可能具有理想的非线性行为（失真效应）。因此很难找到一个简单的模型来实时模拟它们。 Volterra系列模型及其子类是非线性系统建模的常用方法。不幸的是，这些系统很难以分析的方式识别。在本文中，我们建议利用神经网络中取得的新进展来实时模拟它们。我们证明，可以用来自管放大器的信号和神经网络输出之间的均方根误差小于1％的精确仿真。此外，该研究已扩展到对放大器的增益参数进行建模。
