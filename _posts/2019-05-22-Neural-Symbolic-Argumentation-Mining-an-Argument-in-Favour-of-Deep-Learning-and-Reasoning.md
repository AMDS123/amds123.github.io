##### Abstract
Deep learning is bringing remarkable contributions to the field of argumentation mining, but the existing approaches still need to fill the gap towards performing advanced reasoning tasks. We illustrate how neural-symbolic and statistical relational learning could play a crucial role in the integration of symbolic and sub-symbolic methods to achieve this goal.
