##### Abstract
Although recent advances in regional Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) enable them to outperform conventional techniques on standard object detection and classification tasks, their response time is still slow for real-time performance. To address this issue, we propose a method for region proposal as an alternative to selective search, which is used in current state-of-the art object detection algorithms. We evaluate our Keypoint Density-based Region Proposal (KDRP) approach and show that it speeds up detection and classification on fine-grained tasks by 100% versus the existing selective search region proposal technique without compromising classification accuracy. KDRP makes the application of CNNs to real-time detection and classification feasible.

尽管区域卷积神经网络（CNNs）的最新进展使其在传统的标准目标检测和分类任务技术方面表现优异，但其实时性能的响应时间仍然很慢。为了解决这个问题，我们提出一种区域建议的方法作为选择性搜索的替代方法，其被用在当前最先进的目标检测算法中。我们评估了我们的基于Keypoint密度的区域建议（KDRP）方法，并且显示它将细粒度任务的检测和分类加速了100％，而不会影响分类准确性。 KDRP使得CNN的应用可以实时检测和分类。
