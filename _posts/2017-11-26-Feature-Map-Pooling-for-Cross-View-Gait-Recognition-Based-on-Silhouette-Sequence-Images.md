##### Abstract
In this paper, we develop a novel convolutional neural network based approach to extract and aggregate useful information from gait silhouette sequence images instead of simply representing the gait process by averaging silhouette images. The network takes a pair of arbitrary length sequence images as inputs and extracts features for each silhouette independently. Then a feature map pooling strategy is adopted to aggregate sequence features. Subsequently, a network which is similar to Siamese network is designed to perform recognition. The proposed network is simple and easy to implement and can be trained in an end-to-end manner. Cross-view gait recognition experiments are conducted on OU-ISIR large population dataset. The results demonstrate that our network can extract and aggregate features from silhouette sequence effectively. It also achieves significant equal error rates and comparable identification rates when compared with the state of the art.

在本文中，我们开发了一种基于卷积神经网络的方法来提取和聚合步态轮廓序列图像中的有用信息，而不是通过平均轮廓图像来简单地表示步态过程。网络将一对任意长度的序列图像作为输入，并独立地提取每个轮廓的特征。然后采用特征映射池策略对序列特征进行聚合。随后，设计一个类似于连体网络的网络来进行识别。所提出的网络简单易行，可以以端到端的方式进行培训。在OU-ISIR大量人口数据集上进行横向步态识别实验。结果表明，我们的网络可以有效地从轮廓序列中提取和聚合特征。与现有技术相比，它也实现了显着的相等错误率和可比识别率。
