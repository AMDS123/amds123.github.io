##### Abstract
Correlation filtering based tracking model has received lots of attention and achieved great success in real-time tracking, however, the lost function in current correlation filtering paradigm could not reliably response to the appearance changes caused by occlusion and illumination variations. This study intends to promote the robustness of the correlation filter learning. By exploiting the anisotropy of the filter response, three sparsity related loss functions are proposed to alleviate the overfitting issue of previous methods and improve the overall tracking performance. As a result, three real-time trackers are implemented. Extensive experiments in various challenging situations demonstrate that the robustness of the learned correlation filter has been greatly improved via the designed loss functions. In addition, the study reveals, from an experimental perspective, how different loss functions essentially influence the tracking performance. An important conclusion is that the sensitivity of the peak values of the filter in successive frames is consistent with the tracking performance. This is a useful reference criterion in designing a robust correlation filter for visual tracking.

基于相关滤波的跟踪模型在实时跟踪方面受到了广泛的关注，取得了很大的成功，但是目前的相关滤波模型中的丢失函数不能可靠地响应遮挡和光照变化引起的外观变化。本研究旨在提高相关滤波器学习的鲁棒性。通过利用滤波器​​响应的各向异性，提出了三种与稀疏相关的损失函数，以缓解以前方法的过拟合问题，提高整体跟踪性能。结果，实现了三个实时跟踪器。在各种具有挑战性的情况下的大量实验表明，通过设计的损失函数，所学习的相关滤波器的鲁棒性已经得到了很大的改善。此外，研究从实验的角度揭示了不同的损失函数如何影响跟踪性能。一个重要的结论是，连续帧中滤波器峰值的灵敏度与跟踪性能一致。在设计用于视觉跟踪的鲁棒相关滤波器时，这是一个有用的参考标准。
