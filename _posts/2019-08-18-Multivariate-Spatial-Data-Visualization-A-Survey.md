##### Abstract
Multivariate spatial data plays an important role in computational science and engineering simulations. The potential features and hidden relationships in multivariate data can assist scientists to gain an in-depth understanding of a scientific process, verify a hypothesis and further discover a new physical or chemical law. In this paper, we present a comprehensive survey of the state-of-the-art techniques for multivariate spatial data visualization. We first introduce the basic concept and characteristics of multivariate spatial data, and describe three main tasks in multivariate data visualization: feature classification, fusion visualization, and correlation analysis. Finally, we prospect potential research topics for multivariate data visualization according to the current research.
