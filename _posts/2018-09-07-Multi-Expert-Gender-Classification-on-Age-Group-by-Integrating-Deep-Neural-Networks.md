##### Abstract
Generally, facial age variations affect gender classification accuracy significantly, because facial shape and skin texture change as they grow old. This requires re-examination on the gender classification system to consider facial age information. In this paper, we propose Multi-expert Gender Classification on Age Group (MGA), an end-to-end multi-task learning schemes of age estimation and gender classification. First, two types of deep neural networks are utilized; Convolutional Appearance Network (CAN) for facial appearance feature and Deep Geometry Network (DGN) for facial geometric feature. Then, CAN and DGN are integrated by the proposed model integration strategy and fine-tuned in order to improve age and gender classification accuracy. The facial images are categorized into one of three age groups (young, adult and elder group) based on their estimated age, and the system makes a gender prediction according to average fusion strategy of three gender classification experts, which are trained to fit gender characteristics of each age group. Rigorous experimental results conducted on the challenging databases suggest that the proposed MGA outperforms several state-of-art researches with smaller computational cost.

通常，面部年龄变化会显着影响性别分类的准确性，因为面部形状和皮肤纹理随着年龄的增长而变化。这需要重新审查性别分类系统，以考虑面部年龄信息。在本文中，我们提出了年龄组多性别专家分类（MGA），一种年龄估计和性别分类的端到端多任务学习方案。首先，使用两种类型的深度神经网络;用于面部外观特征的卷积外观网络（CAN）和用于面部几何特征的深度几何网络（DGN）。然后，CAN和DGN通过提出的模型集成策略进行整合并进行微调，以提高年龄和性别分类的准确性。根据他们的估计年龄，将面部图像分为三个年龄组（年轻组，成年组和老年组）中的一个，并且系统根据三个性别分类专家的平均融合策略进行性别预测，这些专家被训练以适应性别特征。每个年龄组。在具有挑战性的数据库上进行的严格实验结果表明，所提出的MGA优于具有较小计算成本的几项最新研究。
