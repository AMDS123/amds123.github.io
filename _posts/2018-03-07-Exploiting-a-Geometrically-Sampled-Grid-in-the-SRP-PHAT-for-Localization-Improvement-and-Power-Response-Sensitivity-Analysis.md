##### Abstract
The steered response power phase transform (SRP-PHAT) is a beamformer method very attractive in acoustic localization applications due to its robustness in reverberant environments. This paper presents a spatial grid design procedure, called the geometrically sampled grid (GSG), which aims at computing the spatial grid by taking into account the discrete sampling of time difference of arrival (TDOA) functions and the desired spatial resolution. A new SRP-PHAT localization algorithm based on the GSG method is also introduced. The proposed method exploits the intersections of the discrete hyperboloids representing the TDOA information domain of the sensor array, and projects the whole TDOA information on the space search grid. The GSG method thus allows to design the sampled spatial grid which represents the best search grid for a given sensor array, it allows to perform a sensitivity analysis of the array and to characterize its spatial localization accuracy, and it may assist the system designer in the reconfiguration of the array. Experimental results using both simulated data and real recordings show that the localization accuracy is substantially improved both for high and for low spatial resolution, and that it is closely related to the proposed power response sensitivity measure.

由于其在混响环境中的稳健性，导向响应功率相位变换（SRP-PHAT）是一种在声学定位应用中非常有吸引力的波束形成器方法。本文提出了一种空间网格设计过程，称为几何采样网格（GSG），其目标是通过考虑到达时间差（TDOA）函数的离散采样和期望的空间分辨率来计算空间网格。还介绍了一种基于GSG方法的新型SRP-PHAT定位算法。所提出的方法利用表示传感器阵列的TDOA信息域的离散双曲线的交点，并将整个TDOA信息投影到空间搜索网格上。因此，GSG方法允许设计表示给定传感器阵列的最佳搜索网格的采样空间网​​格，其允许执行对阵列的灵敏度分析并表征其空间定位精度，并且其可帮助系统设计者重新配置阵列。使用模拟数据和实际记录的实验结果表明，对于高空间分辨率和低空间分辨率，定位精度都得到了显着提高，并且与提出的功率响应灵敏度测量密切相关。
