##### Abstract
A person's face discloses important information about their affective state. Although there has been extensive research on recognition of facial expressions, the performance of existing approaches is challenged by facial occlusions. Facial occlusions are often treated as noise and discarded in recognition of affective states. However, hand over face occlusions can provide additional information for recognition of some affective states such as curiosity, frustration and boredom. One of the reasons that this problem has not gained attention is the lack of naturalistic occluded faces that contain hand over face occlusions as well as other types of occlusions. Traditional approaches for obtaining affective data are time demanding and expensive, which limits researchers in affective computing to work on small datasets. This limitation affects the generalizability of models and deprives researchers from taking advantage of recent advances in deep learning that have shown great success in many fields but require large volumes of data. In this paper, we first introduce a novel framework for synthesizing naturalistic facial occlusions from an initial dataset of non-occluded faces and separate images of hands, reducing the costly process of data collection and annotation. We then propose a model for facial occlusion type recognition to differentiate between hand over face occlusions and other types of occlusions such as scarves, hair, glasses and objects. Finally, we present a model to localize hand over face occlusions and identify the occluded regions of the face.

##### Abstract (translated by Google)
一个人的脸上揭示了他们的情感状态的重要信息。尽管对面部表情的识别已经有了广泛的研究，但是现有方法的性能受面部遮挡的挑战。面部遮挡通常被视为噪音，在识别情感状态时被丢弃。然而，交换面部遮挡可以提供用于识别一些情感状态的附加信息，例如好奇心，挫败感和无聊。这个问题没有得到关注的原因之一是缺乏包含面部遮挡以及其他类型遮挡的自然闭塞面部。获取情感数据的传统方法是时间要求高且昂贵的，这限制了情感计算的研究人员在小数据集上工作。这种局限性影响了模型的普遍性，并且剥夺了研究人员利用最近在许多领域取得巨大成功但需要大量数据的深度学习的进展。在本文中，我们首先引入一个新的框架来合成自然面部遮挡，从非遮挡人脸的初始数据集中分离手部图像，减少了昂贵的数据收集和标注过程。然后，我们提出了面部遮挡类型识别的模型，以区分面部遮挡和其他类型的遮挡，例如围巾，头发，眼镜和物体。最后，我们提出一个模型来定位交换面部遮挡，并识别遮挡的面部区域。
