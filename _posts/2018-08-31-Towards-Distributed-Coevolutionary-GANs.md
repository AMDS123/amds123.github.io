##### Abstract
Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have become one of the dominant methods for deep generative modeling. Despite their demonstrated success on multiple vision tasks, GANs are difficult to train and much research has been dedicated towards understanding and improving their gradient-based learning dynamics. Here, we investigate the use of coevolution, a class of black-box (gradient-free) co-optimization techniques and a powerful tool in evolutionary computing, as a supplement to gradient-based GAN training techniques. Experiments on a simple model that exhibits several of the GAN gradient-based dynamics (e.g., mode collapse, oscillatory behavior, and vanishing gradients) show that coevolution is a promising framework for escaping degenerate GAN training behaviors.
