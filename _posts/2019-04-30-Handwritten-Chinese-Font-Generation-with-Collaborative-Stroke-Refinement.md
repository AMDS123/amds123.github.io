##### Abstract
Automatic character generation is an appealing solution for new typeface design, especially for Chinese typefaces including over 3700 most commonly-used characters. This task has two main pain points: (i) handwritten characters are usually associated with thin strokes of few information and complex structure which are error prone during deformation; (ii) thousands of characters with various shapes are needed to synthesize based on a few manually designed characters. To solve those issues, we propose a novel convolutional-neural-network-based model with three main techniques: collaborative stroke refinement, using collaborative training strategy to recover the missing or broken strokes; online zoom-augmentation, taking the advantage of the content-reuse phenomenon to reduce the size of training set; and adaptive pre-deformation, standardizing and aligning the characters. The proposed model needs only 750 paired training samples; no pre-trained network, extra dataset resource or labels is needed. Experimental results show that the proposed method significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art methods under the practical restriction on handwritten font synthesis.
