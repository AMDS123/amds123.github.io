##### Abstract
Street architectures play an essential role in city image and streetscape analysing. However, existing approaches are all supervised which require costly labeled data. To solve this, we propose a street architectural unsupervised classification framework based on Information maximizing Generative Adversarial Nets (InfoGAN), in which we utilize the auxiliary distribution $Q$ of InfoGAN as an unsupervised classifier. Experiments on database of true street view images in Nanjing, China validate the practicality and accuracy of our framework. Furthermore, we draw a series of heuristic conclusions from the intrinsic information hidden in true images. These conclusions will assist planners to know the architectural categories better.
