##### Abstract
Automatic grading is not a new approach but the need to adapt the latest technology to automatic grading has become very important. As the technology has rapidly became more powerful on scoring exams and es- says, especially after the 1990s, partially or wholly automated grading systems using computational methods have evolved and have become a major area of research. In particular, the demand of scoring of natural language responses has created a need for tools that can be applied to automatically grade these responses. In this paper, we focus on the concept of automatic grading of short answer questions such as are typical in the UK GCSE system, and providing useful feedback on their answers to students. We present experimental results on a dataset provided from the introductory computer science class in the Uni- versity of North Texas. We first apply standard data mining techniques to the corpus of student answers for the purpose of measuring similarity between the student answers and the model answer. This is based on the number of common words. We then evaluate the relation between these similarities and marks awarded by scorers. We then consider a clustering approach that groups student answers into clusters. Each cluster would be awarded the same mark, and the same feedback given to each answer in a cluster. In this manner, we demonstrate that clusters indicate the groups of students who are awarded the same or the similar scores. Words in each cluster are compared to show that clusters are constructed based on how many and which words of the model answer have been used. The main novelty in this paper is that we design a model to predict marks based on the similarities between the student answers and the model answer.

自动分级不是一种新方法，但是将最新技术应用于自动分级的需求变得非常重要。随着技术在评分考试中迅速变得更加强大，特别是在20世纪90年代之后，使用计算方法的部分或全部自动化评分系统已经发展并已成为研究的主要领域。特别是，对自然语言反应评分的需求产生了对可用于自动评定这些反应的工具的需求。在本文中，我们重点关注简短答案问题的自动评分概念，例如英国GCSE系统中的典型问题，并提供有关他们对学生答案的有用反馈。我们在北德克萨斯大学的计算机科学入门级数据集中提供实验结果。我们首先将标准数据挖掘技术应用于学生答案的语料库，以便测量学生答案和模型答案之间的相似性。这是基于常用词的数量。然后，我们评估这些相似性与得分者所授予的分数之间的关系。然后，我们考虑一种将学生答案分组到群集中的聚类方法。每个群集将被授予相同的标记，并且对群集中的每个答案给予相同的反馈。通过这种方式，我们证明群集表明被授予相同或相似分数的学生群体。比较每个聚类中的单词以显示基于已使用模型答案的数量和单词来构建聚类。本文的主要新颖之处在于，我们根据学生答案与模型答案之间的相似性设计了一个预测标记的模型。
