##### Abstract
Our work introduces a novel way to increase pose estimation accuracy by discovering parts from unannotated regions of training images. Discovered parts are used to generate more accurate appearance likelihoods for traditional part-based models like Pictorial Structures [13] and its derivatives. Our experiments on images of a hawkmoth in flight show that our proposed approach significantly improves over existing work [27] for this application, while also being more generally applicable. Our proposed approach localizes landmarks at least twice as accurately as a baseline based on a Mixture of Pictorial Structures (MPS) model. Our unique High-Resolution Moth Flight (HRMF) dataset is made publicly available with annotations.

我们的工作引入了一种新的方法，通过发现训练图像的未注释区域的部分来提高姿态估计精度。发现的部分被用来产生像Pictorial Structures [13]及其衍生物这样传统的基于零件的模型的更准确的外观可能性。我们对飞行中的飞机图像进行的实验表明，我们提出的方法显着地改善了现有的工作[27]，同时也更普遍适用。我们提出的方法将地标至少两倍于基于图像结构（MPS）模型的基线的基线。我们独特的高分辨率飞蛾飞行（HRMF）数据集公开提供注释。
