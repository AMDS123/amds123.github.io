##### Abstract
Face recognition has been an active research area in the past few decades. In general, face recognition can be very challenging due to variations in viewpoint, illumination, facial expression, etc. Therefore it is essential to extract features which are invariant to some or all of these variations. Here a new image representation, called scattering transform/network, has been used to extract features from faces. The scattering transform is a kind of convolutional network which provides a powerful multi-layer representation for signals. After extraction of scattering features, PCA is applied to reduce the dimensionality of the data and then a multi-class support vector machine is used to perform recognition. The proposed algorithm has been tested on three face datasets and achieved a very high recognition rate.

人脸识别在过去几十年来一直是一个活跃的研究领域。一般而言，由于视点，照明，面部表情等的变化，面部识别可能是非常具有挑战性的。因此，提取对于这些变化中的一些或全部是不变的特征是至关重要的。这里一个新的图像表示，称为散射变换/网络，已经被用来从面部提取特征。散射变换是一种卷积网络，它为信号提供了强大的多层表示。提取散射特征后，应用PCA降低数据的维数，然后使用多类支持向量机进行识别。该算法已经在三个人脸数据集上进行了测试，并且获得了很高的识别率。
