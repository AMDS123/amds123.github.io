##### Abstract
A constant height of gallium nitride (GaN) nanowires with graphene deposited on them is shown to have a strong enhancement of Raman scattering, whilst variable height nanowires fail to give such an enhancement. Scanning electron microscopy reveals a smooth graphene surface which is present when the GaN nanowires are uniform, whereas graphene on nanowires with substantial height differences is observed to be pierced and stretched by the uppermost nanowires. The energy shifts of the characteristic Raman bands confirms that these differences in the nanowire height has a significant impact on the local graphene strain and the carrier concentration. The images obtained by Kelvin probe force microscopy show clearly that the carrier concentration in graphene is modulated by the nanowire substrate and dependent on the nanowire density. Therefore, the observed surface enhanced Raman scattering for graphene deposited on GaN nanowires of comparable height is triggered by self-induced nano-gating to the graphene. However, no clear correlation of the enhancement with the strain or the carrier concentration of graphene was discovered.

示出了具有沉积在其上的石墨烯的恒定高度的氮化镓（GaN）纳米线具有拉曼散射的强烈增强，而可变高度纳米线不能提供这样的增强。扫描电子显微镜显示当GaN纳米线均匀时存在光滑的石墨烯表面，而观察到具有相当高度差的纳米线上的石墨烯被最上面的纳米线刺穿和拉伸。特征拉曼谱带的能量变化证实，纳米线高度的这些差异对局部石墨烯应变和载流子浓度具有显着的影响。通过开尔文探针力显微镜获得的图像清楚地显示石墨烯中的载流子浓度由纳米线基板调节并取决于纳米线密度。因此，观察到的表面增强拉曼散射石墨烯沉积在相当高度的GaN纳米线是由自诱导纳米门控石墨烯。然而，发现增强与石墨烯的应变或载流子浓度之间没有明确的相关性。
