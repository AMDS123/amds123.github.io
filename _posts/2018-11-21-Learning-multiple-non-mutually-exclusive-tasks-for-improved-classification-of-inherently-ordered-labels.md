##### Abstract
Medical image classification involves thresholding of labels that represent malignancy risk levels. Usually, a task defines a single threshold, and when developing computer-aided diagnosis tools, a single network is trained per such threshold, e.g. as screening out healthy (very low risk) patients to leave possibly sick ones for further analysis (low threshold), or trying to find malignant cases among those marked as non-risk by the radiologist ("second reading", high threshold). We propose a way to rephrase the classification problem in a manner that yields several problems (corresponding to different thresholds) to be solved simultaneously. This allows the use of Multiple Task Learning (MTL) methods, significantly improving the performance of the original classifier, by facilitating effective extraction of information from existing data.
