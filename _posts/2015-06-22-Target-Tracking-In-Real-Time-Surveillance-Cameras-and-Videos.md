##### Abstract
Security concerns has been kept on increasing, so it is important for everyone to keep their property safe from thefts and destruction. So the need for surveillance techniques are also increasing. The system has been developed to detect the motion in a video. A system has been developed for real time applications by using the techniques of background subtraction and frame differencing. In this system, motion is detected from the webcam or from the real time video. Background subtraction and frames differencing method has been used to detect the moving target. In background subtraction method, current frame is subtracted from the referenced frame and then the threshold is applied. If the difference is greater than the threshold then it is considered as the pixel from the moving object, otherwise it is considered as background pixel. Similarly, two frames difference method takes difference between two continuous frames. Then that resultant difference frame is thresholded and the amount of difference pixels is calculated.

安全问题一直在增加，所以每个人都必须保护自己的财产免遭盗窃和破坏。所以对监控技术的需求也在增加。该系统已被开发来检测视频中的运动。通过使用背景减除和帧差分的技术已经开发了用于实时应用的系统。在这个系统中，从网络摄像头或实时视频中检测到运动。已经使用背景减法和帧差分法来检测移动目标。在背景减法中，从参考帧中减去当前帧，然后应用阈值。如果差值大于阈值，则认为是来自运动物体的像素，否则认为是背景像素。类似地，两帧差分方法在两个连续帧之间取得差异。然后，对得到的差分帧进行阈值处理，并计算差分像素的数量。
