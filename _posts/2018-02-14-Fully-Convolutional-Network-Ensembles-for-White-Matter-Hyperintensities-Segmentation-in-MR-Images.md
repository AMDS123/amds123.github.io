##### Abstract
White matter hyperintensities (WMH) are commonly found in the brains of healthy elderly individuals and have been associated with various neurological and geriatric disorders. In this paper, we present a study using deep fully convolutional network and ensemble models to automatically detect such WMH using fluid attenuation inversion recovery (FLAIR) and T1 magnetic resonance (MR) scans. The algorithm was evaluated and ranked 1 st in the WMH Segmentation Challenge at MICCAI 2017. In the evaluation stage, the implementation of the algorithm was submitted to the challenge organizers, who then independently tested it on a hidden set of 110 cases from 5 scanners. Averaged dice score, precision and robust Hausdorff distance obtained on held-out test datasets were 80%, 84% and 6.30mm respectively. These were the highest achieved in the challenge, suggesting the proposed method is the state-of-the-art. In this paper, we provide detailed descriptions and quantitative analysis on key components of the system. Furthermore, a study of cross-scanner evaluation is presented to discuss how the combination of modalities and data augmentation affect the generalization capability of the system. The adaptability of the system to different scanners and protocols is also investigated. A quantitative study is further presented to test the effect of ensemble size. Additionally, software and models of our method are made publicly available. The effectiveness and generalization capability of the proposed system show its potential for real-world clinical practice.

白质高信号（WMH）常见于健康老年人的大脑中，并与各种神经和老年病症有关。在本文中，我们提出了一个使用深度完全卷积网络和集成模型来自动检测这种使用流体衰减反转恢复（FLAIR）和T1磁共振（MR）扫描的WMH的研究。该算法在MICCAI 2017的WMH分段挑战赛中进行了评估和排名第一。在评估阶段，将算法的实施提交给挑战组织者，挑战组织者然后独立地对来自5台扫描仪的一组隐藏的110个案例进行测试。平均骰子得分，精确性和鲁棒豪斯多夫距离分别为80％，84％和6.30mm。这是挑战中实现的最高水平，表明所提议的方法是最先进的。在本文中，我们对系统的关键组件进行了详细的描述和定量分析。此外，还提出了一个交叉扫描器评估的研究，以讨论模态和数据增加的组合如何影响系统的泛化能力。还研究了系统对不同扫描仪和协议的适应性。定量研究进一步提出来测试集合大小的影响。此外，我们的方法的软件和模型已公开。所提出的系统的有效性和泛化能力显示出其对现实世界临床实践的潜力。
