##### Abstract
Simultaneous machine translation attempts to translate a source sentence before it is finished being spoken, with applications to translation of spoken language for live streaming and conversation. Since simultaneous systems trade quality to reduce latency, having an effective and interpretable latency metric is crucial. We introduce a variant of the recently proposed Average Lagging (AL) metric, which we call Differentiable Average Lagging (DAL). It distinguishes itself by being differentiable and internally consistent to its underlying mathematical model.
