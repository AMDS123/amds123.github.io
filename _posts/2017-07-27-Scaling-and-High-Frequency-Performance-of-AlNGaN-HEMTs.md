##### Abstract
Small- and large-signal RF characteristics were measured on AlN GaN HEMTs with 80-160 nm gate length and 100-300 {\mu}m width. Consistent with the literature, current-gain cut-off frequency and maximum frequency of oscillation were found to increase with inverse gate length and independent of gate width. For the first time, output power and efficiency were reported at the high end of Xband, and were comparable to the best reported at 2 GHz and insensitive to gate length or width. These results suggest that the AlN/GaN HEMTs can be further scaled for even higher frequency and higher power performance.

在80-160nm栅极长度和100-300μm宽度的AlN GaN HEMT上测量小信号和大信号RF特性。与文献一致，发现电流增益截止频率和振荡的最大频率随反向栅极长度而增加，而与栅极宽度无关。在Xband的高端报告的输出功率和效率是第一次，与在2 GHz报道的最好的结果相当，而且对栅极长度或宽度不敏感。这些结果表明，AlN / GaN HEMTs可以进一步升级以获得更高的频率和更高的功率性能。
