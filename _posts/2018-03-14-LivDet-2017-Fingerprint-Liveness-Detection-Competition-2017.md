##### Abstract
Fingerprint Presentation Attack Detection (FPAD) deals with distinguishing images coming from artificial replicas of the fingerprint characteristic, made up of materials like silicone, gelatine or latex, and images coming from alive fingerprints. Images are captured by modern scanners, typically relying on solid-state or optical technologies. Since from 2009, the Fingerprint Liveness Detection Competition (LivDet) aims to assess the performance of the state-of-the-art algorithms according to a rigorous experimental protocol and, at the same time, a simple overview of the basic achievements. The competition is open to all academics research centers and all companies that work in this field. The positive, increasing trend of the participants number, which supports the success of this initiative, is confirmed even this year: 17 algorithms were submitted to the competition, with a larger involvement of companies and academies. This means that the topic is relevant for both sides, and points out that a lot of work must be done in terms of fundamental and applied research.

指纹呈现攻击检测（FPAD）处理来自人造指纹特征复制品的区别图像，由硅胶，明胶或乳胶等材料以及来自活着指纹的图像组成。现代扫描仪捕获图像，通常依靠固态或光学技术。自2009年以来，指纹活性检测竞赛（LivDet）旨在根据严格的实验协议评估最先进算法的性能，同时简要概述基本成就。所有学术研究中心和所有在该领域工作的公司均可参加竞赛。即使今年，参与者人数的积极增长趋势也得到了证实：17项算法已提交给竞争对手，公司和学院的参与程度更高。这意味着这个话题对于双方都是相关的，并指出在基础和应用研究方面必须做很多工作。
