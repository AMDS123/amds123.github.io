##### Abstract
Recent years have seen rising needs for location-based services in our everyday life. Aside from the many advantages provided by these services, they have caused serious concerns regarding the location privacy of users. An adversary such as an untrusted location-based server can monitor the queried locations by a user to infer critical information such as the user's home address, health conditions, shopping habits, etc. To address this issue, dummy-based algorithms have been developed to increase the anonymity of users, and thus, protecting their privacy. Unfortunately, the existing algorithms only consider a limited amount of side information known by an adversary which may face more serious challenges in practice. In this paper, we incorporate a new type of side information based on consecutive location changes of users and propose a new metric called transition-entropy to investigate the location privacy preservation, followed by two algorithms to improve the transition-entropy for a given dummy generation algorithm. Then, we develop an attack model based on the Viterbi algorithm which can significantly threaten the location privacy of the users. Next, in order to protect the users from Viterbi attack, we propose an algorithm called robust dummy generation (RDG) which can resist against the Viterbi attack while maintaining a high performance in terms of the privacy metrics introduced in the paper. All the algorithms are applied and analyzed on a real-life dataset.

近年来，我们日常生活中对基于位置的服务的需求不断增长。除了这些服务提供的许多优势之外，它们还引起了用户位置隐私的严重担忧。诸如不受信任的基于位置的服务器之类的对手可以监视用户查询的位置以推断诸如用户的家庭住址，健康状况，购物习惯等的关键信息。为了解决这个问题，已经开发了基于虚拟的算法增加用户的匿名性，从而保护他们的隐私。不幸的是，现有的算法只考虑了对手已知的有限数量的边界信息，这些信息在实践中可能面临更严峻的挑战。在本文中，我们引入了一种基于用户连续位置变化的新型边信息，并提出了一种称为转移熵的新度量来调查位置隐私保护，其次是两种算法来改善给定虚拟世代的转换熵算法。然后，我们开发了一个基于Viterbi算法的攻击模型，这个模型可能会严重威胁用户的位置隐私。接下来，为了保护用户免受维特比攻击，我们提出了一种称为鲁棒虚拟生成（RDG）的算法，该算法能够抵御维特比攻击，同时保持本文中介绍的隐私度量方面的高性能。所有的算法都在真实的数据集上进行应用和分析。
