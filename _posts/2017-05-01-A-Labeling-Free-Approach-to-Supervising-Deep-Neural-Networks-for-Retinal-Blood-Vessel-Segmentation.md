##### Abstract
Segmenting blood vessels in fundus imaging plays an important role in medical diagnosis. Many algorithms have been proposed. While deep Neural Networks have been attracting enormous attention from computer vision community recent years and several novel works have been done in terms of its application in retinal blood vessel segmentation, most of them are based on supervised learning which requires amount of labeled data, which is both scarce and expensive to obtain. We leverage the power of Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (DCNN) in feature learning, in this work, to achieve this ultimate goal. The highly efficient feature learning of DCNN inspires our novel approach that trains the networks with automatically-generated samples to achieve desirable performance on real-world fundus images. For this, we design a set of rules abstracted from the domain-specific prior knowledge to generate these samples. We argue that, with the high efficiency of DCNN in feature learning, one can achieve this goal by constructing the training dataset with prior knowledge, no manual labeling is needed. This approach allows us to take advantages of supervised learning without labeling. We also build a naive DCNN model to test it. The results on standard benchmarks of fundus imaging show it is competitive to the state-of-the-art methods which implies a potential way to leverage the power of DCNN in feature learning.

在眼底成像中分割血管在医学诊断中起着重要的作用。已经提出了许多算法。近年来，深层神经网络引起了计算机视觉界的广泛关注，在视网膜血管分割方面已经取得了一些新进展，但其中大部分是基于监督学习的，需要大量的标记数据，既缺乏又昂贵。在这项工作中，我们利用深度卷积神经网络（DCNN）功能学习的功能来实现这个最终目标。 DCNN的高效特征学习激发了我们采用自动生成的样本来训练网络的新颖方法，以在真实世界的眼底图像上实现期望的性能。为此，我们设计了一组从规则领域抽象出来的规则来生成这些样本。我们认为，在DCNN在特征学习中的高效率的情况下，可以通过构造具有先验知识的训练数据集来实现这个目标，不需要手动标记。这种方法使我们能够利用有监督的学习而不用标签。我们也建立一个幼稚的DCNN模型来测试它。眼底成像的标准基准的结果表明其与最先进的方法相比具有竞争性，这意味着在特征学习中利用DCNN的能力的潜在方式。
