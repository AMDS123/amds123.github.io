##### Abstract
Current face recognition systems robustly recognize identities across a wide variety of imaging conditions. In these systems recognition is performed via classification into known identities obtained from supervised identity annotations. There are two problems with this current paradigm: (1) current systems are unable to benefit from unlabelled data which may be available in large quantities; and (2) current systems equate successful recognition with labelling a given input image. Humans, on the other hand, regularly perform identification of individuals completely unsupervised, recognising the identity of someone they have seen before even without being able to name that individual. How can we go beyond the current classification paradigm towards a more human understanding of identities? We propose an integrated Bayesian model that coherently reasons about the observed images, identities, partial knowledge about names, and the situational context of each observation. While our model achieves good recognition performance against known identities, it can also discover new identities from unsupervised data and learns to associate identities with different contexts depending on which identities tend to be observed together. In addition, the proposed semi-supervised component is able to handle not only acquaintances, whose names are known, but also unlabelled familiar faces and complete strangers in a unified framework.

##### Abstract (translated by Google)
当前的面部识别系统可以在各种成像条件下稳健地识别身份。在这些系统中，通过分类到从监督身份注释获得的已知身份来执行识别。这个当前范例存在两个问题：（1）当前系统无法从可能大量获得的未标记数据中受益; （2）当前系统将成功识别等同于给定输入图像的标记。另一方面，人类定期对完全无人监督的个体进行识别，即使没有能够命名该个体，也要认识到他们之前见过的人的身份。我们如何超越当前的分类范式，更加人性化地理解身份？我们提出了一个综合的贝叶斯模型，该模型连贯地证明了观察到的图像，身份，名称的部分知识以及每个观察的情境背景。虽然我们的模型对已知身份获得了良好的识别性能，但它也可以从无监督数据中发现新身份，并学习将身份与不同情境联系起来，这取决于哪些身份倾向于一起观察。此外，拟议的半监督组件不仅能够处理熟人的名字，而且还能够处理统一框架中未标记的熟悉面孔和完全陌生人。
