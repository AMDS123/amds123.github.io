##### Abstract
Over the last few years, automatic facial micro-expression analysis has garnered increasing attention from experts across different disciplines because of its potential applications in various fields such as clinical diagnosis, forensic investigation and security systems. Advances in computer algorithms and video acquisition technology have rendered machine analysis of facial micro-expressions possible today, in contrast to decades ago when it was primarily the domain of psychiatrists where analysis was largely manual. Indeed, although the study of facial micro-expressions is a well-established field in psychology, it is still relatively new from the computational perspective with many interesting problems. In this survey, we present a comprehensive review of state-of-the-art databases and methods for micro-expressions spotting and recognition. Individual stages involved in the automation of these tasks are also described and reviewed at length. In addition, we also deliberate on the challenges and future directions in this growing field of automatic facial micro-expression analysis.

在过去几年中，自动面部微表达分析因其在不同领域的专家中越来越受到关注，这是因为其在临床诊断，法医调查和安全系统等各个领域中的潜在应用。计算机算法和视频采集技术的进步使面部微表情的机器分析成为可能，而几十年前它主要是精神病医生的领域，分析主要是手工分析。事实上，虽然面部微表情的研究在心理学领域是一个非常成熟的领域，但从计算角度来看，它仍然是一个相对较新的领域，并且存在许多有趣的问题。在这次调查中，我们对微型表达式发现和识别的最新数据库和方法进行了全面审查。涉及这些任务自动化的各个阶段也会被详细描述和审查。此外，我们还在这个日益增长的自动面部微表情分析领域中考虑了挑战和未来发展方向。
