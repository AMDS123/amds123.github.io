##### Abstract
In this paper, we have extensively investigated the unconstrained ear recognition problem. We have first shown the importance of domain adaptation, when deep convolutional neural network models are used for ear recognition. To enable domain adaptation, we have collected a new ear dataset using the Multi-PIE face dataset, which we named as Multi-PIE ear dataset. To improve the performance further, we have combined different deep convolutional neural network models. We have analyzed in depth the effect of ear image quality, for example illumination and aspect ratio, on the classification performance. Finally, we have addressed the problem of dataset bias in the ear recognition field. Experiments on the UERC dataset have shown that domain adaptation leads to a significant performance improvement. For example, when VGG-16 model is used and the domain adaptation is applied, an absolute increase of around 10\% has been achieved. Combining different deep convolutional neural network models has further improved the accuracy by 4\%. It has also been observed that image quality has an influence on the results. In the experiments that we have conducted to examine the dataset bias, given an ear image, we were able to classify the dataset that it has come from with 99.71\% accuracy, which indicates a strong bias among the ear recognition datasets.

在本文中，我们广泛研究了无约束耳识别问题。我们首先证明了当深度卷积神经网络模型用于耳朵识别时领域适应的重要性。为了启用域适应，我们使用Multi-PIE人脸数据集收集了一个新的人耳数据集，我们将其命名为Multi-PIE人耳数据集。为了进一步提高性能，我们组合了不同的深度卷积神经网络模型。我们深入分析了人耳图像质量的影响，例如照明和宽高比等对分类性能的影响。最后，我们已经解决了耳朵识别领域中数据集偏差的问题。 UERC数据集上的实验表明，领域适应导致了显着的性能提升。例如，当使用VGG-16模型并应用领域适应时，已经实现了大约10％的绝对增加。结合不同的深度卷积神经网络模型，将精度进一步提高了4％。也观察到图像质量对结果有影响。在我们进行的用于检查数据集偏差的实验中，给定一个耳朵图像，我们能够将来自99.71％精度的数据集进行分类，这表明耳朵识别数据集中存在较强的偏差。
