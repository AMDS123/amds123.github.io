##### Abstract
A speech-based hearing test is designed to identify the susceptible error-prone phones for individual hearing impaired (HI) ear. Only robust tokens in the experiment noise levels had been chosen for the test. The noise-robustness of tokens is measured as SNR90 of the token, which is the signal to the speech-weighted noise ratio where a normal hearing (NH) listener would recognize the token with an accuracy of 90% on average. Two sets of tokens T1 and T2 having the same consonant-vowels but different talkers with distinct SNR90 had been presented with flat gain at listeners' most comfortable level. We studied the effects of frequency fine-tuning of the primary cue by presenting tokens of the same consonant but different vowels with similar SNR90. Additionally, we investigated the role of changing the intensity of primary cue in HI phone recognition, by presenting tokens from both sets T1 and T2. On average, 92% of tokens are improved when we replaced the CV with the same CV but with a more robust talker. Additionally, using CVs with similar SNR90, on average, tokens are improved by 75%, 71%, 63%, and 72%, when we replaced vowels /A, ae, I, E/, respectively. The confusion pattern in each case provides insight into how these changes affect the phone recognition in each HI ear. We propose to prescribe hearing aid amplification tailored to individual HI ears, based on the confusion pattern, the response from cue enhancement, and the response from frequency fine-tuning of the cue.
