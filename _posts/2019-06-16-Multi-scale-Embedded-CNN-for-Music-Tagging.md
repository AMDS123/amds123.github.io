##### Abstract
Convolutional neural networks (CNN) recently gained notable attraction in a variety of machine learning tasks: including music classification and style tagging. In this work, we propose implementing intermediate connections to the CNN architecture to facilitate the transfer of multi-scale/level knowledge between different layers. Our novel model for music tagging shows significant improvement in comparison to the proposed approaches in the literature, due to its ability to carry low-level timbral features to the last layer.
