##### Abstract
Predicting stock market movements is a well-known problem of interest. Now-a-days social media is perfectly representing the public sentiment and opinion about current events. Especially, twitter has attracted a lot of attention from researchers for studying the public sentiments. Stock market prediction on the basis of public sentiments expressed on twitter has been an intriguing field of research. Previous studies have concluded that the aggregate public mood collected from twitter may well be correlated with Dow Jones Industrial Average Index (DJIA). The thesis of this work is to observe how well the changes in stock prices of a company, the rises and falls, are correlated with the public opinions being expressed in tweets about that company. Understanding author's opinion from a piece of text is the objective of sentiment analysis. The present paper have employed two different textual representations, Word2vec and N-gram, for analyzing the public sentiments in tweets. In this paper, we have applied sentiment analysis and supervised machine learning principles to the tweets extracted from twitter and analyze the correlation between stock market movements of a company and sentiments in tweets. In an elaborate way, positive news and tweets in social media about a company would definitely encourage people to invest in the stocks of that company and as a result the stock price of that company would increase. At the end of the paper, it is shown that a strong correlation exists between the rise and falls in stock prices with the public sentiments in tweets.

预测股市走势是一个众所周知的问题。现在的社交媒体完全代表了公众对时事的看法和看法。尤其是Twitter已经引起了研究者们对研究民众情绪的关注。在Twitter上公开表达的基于公众情绪的股市预测一直是一个有趣的研究领域。之前的研究已经得出结论，从twitter收集到的公众情绪可能与道琼斯工业平均指数（DJIA）密切相关。这项工作的主题是观察一家公司的股票价格变化如何，以及这个公司股价上涨和下跌，是否与公众的意见相关。从一篇文章理解作者的意见是情感分析的目标。本文采用了两种不同的文本表达方式：Word2vec和N-gram来分析推特中的公众情绪。本文对twitter中提取的推文进行情绪分析和监督机器学习原理，分析公司股票走势与推特情绪的相关性。精心设计的方式是，在社交媒体上发布关于公司的正面新闻和推特肯定会鼓励人们投资该公司的股票，结果公司的股票价格将会上涨。文章最后表明，股票价格的上涨和下跌与微博中的公众情绪存在很强的相关性。
