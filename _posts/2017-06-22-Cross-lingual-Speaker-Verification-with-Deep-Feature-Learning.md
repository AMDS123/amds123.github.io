##### Abstract
Existing speaker verification (SV) systems often suffer from performance degradation if there is any language mismatch between model training, speaker enrollment, and test. A major cause of this degradation is that most existing SV methods rely on a probabilistic model to infer the speaker factor, so any significant change on the distribution of the speech signal will impact the inference. Recently, we proposed a deep learning model that can learn how to extract the speaker factor by a deep neural network (DNN). By this feature learning, an SV system can be constructed with a very simple back-end model. In this paper, we investigate the robustness of the feature-based SV system in situations with language mismatch. Our experiments were conducted on a complex cross-lingual scenario, where the model training was in English, and the enrollment and test were in Chinese or Uyghur. The experiments demonstrated that the feature-based system outperformed the i-vector system with a large margin, particularly with language mismatch between enrollment and test.

如果模型训练，演讲者注册和测试之间存在任何语言不匹配，则现有的说话者验证（SV）系统经常遭受性能下降。造成这种恶化的一个主要原因是，大多数现有的SV方法都依赖于概率模型来推断说话者因子，因此语音信号分布的任何显着变化都将影响推理。最近，我们提出了一个深度学习模型，可以学习如何通过深度神经网络（DNN）来提取说话人因子。通过这个特征学习，一个SV系统可以用一个非常简单的后端模型来构建。在本文中，我们研究了基于特征的SV系统在语言不匹配的情况下的鲁棒性。我们的实验是在一个复杂的跨语言情景下进行的，模型训练是英语的，而且入学和考试是在中国或维吾尔语。实验表明，基于特征的系统性能优于i-vector系统，特别是入学与测试语言不匹配。
