##### Abstract
Natural languages are complexly structured entities. They exhibit characterising regularities that can be exploited to link them one another. In this work, I compare two morphological aspects of languages: Written Patterns and Sentence Structure. I show how languages spontaneously group by similarity in both analyses and derive an average language distance. Finally, exploiting Sentence Structure I developed an Artificial Neural Network capable of distinguishing languages suggesting that not only word roots but also grammatical sentence structure is a characterising trait which alone suffice to identify them.
