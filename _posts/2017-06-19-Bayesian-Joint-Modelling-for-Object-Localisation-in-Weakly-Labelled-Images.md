##### Abstract
We address the problem of localisation of objects as bounding boxes in images and videos with weak labels. This weakly supervised object localisation problem has been tackled in the past using discriminative models where each object class is localised independently from other classes. In this paper, a novel framework based on Bayesian joint topic modelling is proposed, which differs significantly from the existing ones in that: (1) All foreground object classes are modelled jointly in a single generative model that encodes multiple object co-existence so that "explaining away" inference can resolve ambiguity and lead to better learning and localisation. (2) Image backgrounds are shared across classes to better learn varying surroundings and "push out" objects of interest. (3) Our model can be learned with a mixture of weakly labelled and unlabelled data, allowing the large volume of unlabelled images on the Internet to be exploited for learning. Moreover, the Bayesian formulation enables the exploitation of various types of prior knowledge to compensate for the limited supervision offered by weakly labelled data, as well as Bayesian domain adaptation for transfer learning. Extensive experiments on the PASCAL VOC, ImageNet and YouTube-Object videos datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our Bayesian joint model for weakly supervised object localisation.

我们解决了在图像和弱标签视频中将对象本地化为边界框的问题。这种弱监督的对象本地化问题已经在过去使用区分模型来解决，其中每个对象类别独立于其他类别而被本地化。本文提出了一种基于贝叶斯联合主题建模的框架，与现有框架存在显着差异：（1）将所有的前景对象类联合建模成一个单一的生成多个对象共存的生成模型， “解释”推理可以解决歧义问题，并带来更好的学习和本地化。 （2）图像背景在课堂上共享，以更好地学习不同的环境，并“推出”感兴趣的对象。 （3）我们的模型可以混合使用弱标记和未标记的数据，从而可以利用因特网上的大量未标记图像进行学习。此外，贝叶斯公式能够利用各种先验知识来弥补弱标记数据提供的有限监督，以及贝叶斯领域适应转移学习。在PASCAL VOC，ImageNet和YouTube-Object视频数据集上的大量实验证明了我们的贝叶斯联合模型对弱监督对象定位的有效性。
