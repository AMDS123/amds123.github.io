##### Abstract
Kinect skeleton tracker is able to achieve considerable human body tracking performance in convenient and a low-cost manner. However, The tracker often captures unnatural human poses such as discontinuous and vibrated motions when self-occlusions occur. A majority of approaches tackle this problem by using multiple Kinect sensors in a workspace. Combination of the measurements from different sensors is then conducted in Kalman filter framework or optimization problem is formulated for sensor fusion. However, these methods usually require heuristics to measure reliability of measurements observed from each Kinect sensor. In this paper, we developed a method to improve Kinect skeleton using single Kinect sensor, in which supervised learning technique was employed to correct unnatural tracking motions. Specifically, deep recurrent neural networks were used for improving joint positions and velocities of Kinect skeleton, and three methods were proposed to integrate the refined positions and velocities for further enhancement. Moreover, we suggested a novel measure to evaluate naturalness of captured motions. We evaluated the proposed approach by comparison with the ground truth obtained using a commercial optical maker-based motion capture system.

##### Abstract (translated by Google)
Kinect骨骼跟踪器能够以便捷和低成本的方式实现可观的人体跟踪性能。然而，当发生自闭症时，追踪器经常捕捉不自然的人体姿势，例如不连续的和振动的动作。大多数方法通过在工作空间中使用多个Kinect传感器来解决这个问题。然后在卡尔曼滤波器框架中进行来自不同传感器的测量的组合，或者为传感器融合制定优化问题。但是，这些方法通常需要启发式方法来测量每个Kinect传感器观测到的测量结果的可靠性。在本文中，我们利用单个Kinect传感器开发了一种改进Kinect骨架的方法，其中使用监督学习技术来校正非自然跟踪运动。具体来说，使用深回归神经网络来提高Kinect骨架的关节位置和速度，并且提出了三种方法来整合精化的位置和速度以进一步增强。此外，我们提出了一个新的措施来评估被捕获的议案的自然性。我们通过与使用基于商业光学制造商的动作捕捉系统获得的基本事实进行比较来评估所提出的方法。
