##### Abstract
Noise is an important factor which when get added to an image reduces its quality and appearance. So in order to enhance the image qualities, it has to be removed with preserving the textural information and structural features of image. There are different types of noises exist who corrupt the images. Selection of the denoising algorithm is application dependent. Hence, it is necessary to have knowledge about the noise present in the image so as to select the appropriate denoising algorithm. Objective of this paper is to present brief account on types of noises, its types and different noise removal algorithms. In the first section types of noises on the basis of their additive and multiplicative nature are being discussed. In second section a precise classification and analysis of the different potential image denoising algorithm is presented. At the end of paper, a comparative study of all these algorithms in context of performance evaluation is done and concluded with several promising directions for future research work.
