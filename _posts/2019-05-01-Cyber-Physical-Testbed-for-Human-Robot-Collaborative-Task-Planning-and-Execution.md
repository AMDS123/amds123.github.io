##### Abstract
In this paper, we present a cyber-physical testbed created to enable a human-robot team to preform a shared task in a shared workspace. The testbed is suitable for the implementation of a tabletop manipulation task, a common human-robot collaboration scenario. The testbed integrates elements that exists in the physical and virtual world. In this work, we report the insights we gathered through out our exploration in understanding and implementing task planning and execution for human-robot team.
