##### Abstract
Compressed sensing (CS) is a sampling theory that allows reconstruction of sparse (or compressible) signals from an incomplete number of measurements, using of a sensing mechanism implemented by an appropriate projection matrix. The CS theory is based on random Gaussian projection matrices, which satisfy recovery guarantees with high probability; however, sparse ternary {0, -1, +1} projections are more suitable for hardware implementation. In this paper, we present a deep learning approach to obtain very sparse ternary projections for compressed sensing. Our deep learning architecture jointly learns a pair of a projection matrix and a reconstruction operator in an end-to-end fashion. The experimental results on real images demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach compared to state-of-the-art methods, with significant advantage in terms of complexity.

##### Abstract (translated by Google)
压缩感知（CS）是一种采样理论，它允许使用由适当的投影矩阵实现的感测机制，从不完整数量的测量中重构稀疏（或可压缩）信号。 CS理论基于随机高斯投影矩阵，满足高概率的恢复保证;然而，稀疏的三元{0，-1，+1}投影更适合硬件实现。在本文中，我们提出了一个深入的学习方法来获得非常稀疏的三元投影压缩感知。我们的深度学习架构以端到端的方式共同学习一对投影矩阵和重建算子。实际图像的实验结果证明了所提出的方法与最先进的方法相比的有效性，在复杂性方面具有显着的优势。
