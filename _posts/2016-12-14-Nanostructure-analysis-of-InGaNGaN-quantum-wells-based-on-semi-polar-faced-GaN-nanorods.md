##### Abstract
We demonstrate a series of InGaN/GaN double quantum well nanostructure elements. We grow a layer of 2 {\mu}m undoped GaN template on top of a (0001)-direction sapphire substrate. A 100 nm SiO2 thin film is deposited on top as a masking pattern layer. This layer is then covered with a 300 nm aluminum layer as the anodic aluminum oxide (AAO) hole pattern layer. After oxalic acid etching, we transfer the hole pattern from the AAO layer to the SiO2 layer by reactive ion etching. Lastly, we utilize metal-organic chemical vapor deposition to grow GaN nanorods approximately 1.5 {\mu}m in size. We then grow two layers of InGaN/GaN double quantum wells on the semi-polar face of the GaN nanorod substrate under different temperatures. We then study the characteristics of the InGaN/GaN quantum wells formed on the semi-polar faces of GaN nanorods. We report the following findings from our study: first, using SiO2 with repeating hole pattern, we are able to grow high-quality GaN nanorods with diameters of approximately 80-120 nm; second, photoluminescence (PL) measurements enable us to identify Fabry-Perot effect from InGaN/GaN quantum wells on the semi-polar face. We calculate the quantum wells' cavity thickness with obtained PL measurements. Lastly, high resolution TEM images allow us to study the lattice structure characteristics of InGaN/GaN quantum wells on GaN nanorod and identify the existence of threading dislocations in the lattice structure that affects the GaN nanorod's growth mechanism.
