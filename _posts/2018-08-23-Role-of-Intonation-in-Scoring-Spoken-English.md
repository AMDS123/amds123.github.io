##### Abstract
In this paper, we have introduced and evaluated intonation based feature for scoring the English speech of nonnative English speakers in Indian context. For this, we created an automated spoken English scoring engine to learn from the manual evaluation of spoken English. This involved using an existing Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) engine to convert the speech to text. Thereafter, macro features like accuracy, fluency and prosodic features were used to build a scoring model. In the process, we introduced SimIntonation, short for similarity between spoken intonation pattern and "ideal" i.e. training intonation pattern. Our results show that it is a highly predictive feature under controlled environment. We also categorized interword pauses into 4 distinct types for a granular evaluation of pauses and their impact on speech evaluation. Moreover, we took steps to moderate test difficulty through its evaluation across parameters like difficult word count, average sentence readability and lexical density. Our results show that macro features like accuracy and intonation, and micro features like pause-topography are strongly predictive. The scoring of spoken English is not within the purview of this paper.

在本文中，我们引入并评估了基于语调的特征，用于在印度语境中对非母语英语人士的英语演讲进行评分。为此，我们创建了一个自动英语口语评分引擎，以学习英语口语的手动评估。这涉及使用现有的自动语音识别（ASR）引擎将语音转换为文本。此后，使用准确性，流畅性和韵律特征等宏观特征来构建评分模型。在这个过程中，我们引入了SimIntonation，简称语音模式和“理想”即训练语调模式之间的相似性。我们的结果表明它在受控环境下是一种高度预测的特征。我们还将词间暂停分为4种不同类型，以便对暂停及其对语音评估的影响进行细化评估。此外，我们采取措施通过对难度字数，平均句子可读性和词汇密度等参数的评估来调节测试难度。我们的研究结果表明，准确性和语调等宏观特征以及暂停地形等微观特征具有很强的预测性。英语口语的得分不属于本文的范围。
