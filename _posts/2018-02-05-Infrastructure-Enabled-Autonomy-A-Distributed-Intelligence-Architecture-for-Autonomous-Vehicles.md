##### Abstract
Multiple studies have illustrated the potential for dramatic societal, environmental and economic benefits from significant penetration of autonomous driving. However, all the current approaches to autonomous driving require the automotive manufacturers to shoulder the primary responsibility and liability associated with replacing human perception and decision making with automation, potentially slowing the penetration of autonomous vehicles, and consequently slowing the realization of the societal benefits of autonomous vehicles. We propose here a new approach to autonomous driving that will re-balance the responsibility and liabilities associated with autonomous driving between traditional automotive manufacturers, infrastructure players, and third-party players. Our proposed distributed intelligence architecture leverages the significant advancements in connectivity and edge computing in the recent decades to partition the driving functions between the vehicle, edge computers on the road side, and specialized third-party computers that reside in the vehicle. Infrastructure becomes a critical enabler for autonomy. With this Infrastructure Enabled Autonomy (IEA) concept, the traditional automotive manufacturers will only need to shoulder responsibility and liability comparable to what they already do today, and the infrastructure and third-party players will share the added responsibility and liabilities associated with autonomous functionalities. We propose a Bayesian Network Model based framework for assessing the risk benefits of such a distributed intelligence architecture. An additional benefit of the proposed architecture is that it enables "autonomy as a service" while still allowing for private ownership of automobiles.

多项研究表明，自动驾驶的显着渗透可能带来巨大的社会，环境和经济收益。然而，目前所有的自动驾驶方法都要求汽车制造商承担与用自动化取代人类感知和决策相关的主要责任和责任，可能会减慢自动驾驶汽车的渗透，并因此放慢实现自治的社会效益汽车。我们在这里提出了一种新的自主驾驶方法，将重新平衡传统汽车制造商，基础设施运营商和第三方玩家之间与自主驾驶相关的责任和义务。我们提出的分布式智能体系结构利用了近几十年来连接性和边缘计算方面的显着进步来划分车辆，路边计算机和位于车辆中的专用第三方计算机之间的驱动功能。基础设施成为自治的关键促成因素。凭借这种基础设施支持自主（IEA）理念，传统汽车制造商将只需承担与他们目前已做的工作相当的责任和责任，而基础设施和第三方参与者将分担与自主功能相关的额外责任和义务。我们提出了一个基于贝叶斯网络模型的框架来评估这种分布式智能体系结构的风险收益。所提出的架构的另一个好处是它能够实现“自治即服务”，同时仍然允许汽车的私人所有权。
