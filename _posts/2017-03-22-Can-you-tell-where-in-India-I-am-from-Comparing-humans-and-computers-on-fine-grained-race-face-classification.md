##### Abstract
Faces form the basis for a rich variety of judgments in humans, yet the underlying features remain poorly understood. Although fine-grained distinctions within a race might more strongly constrain possible facial features used by humans than in case of coarse categories such as race or gender, such fine grained distinctions are relatively less studied. Fine-grained race classification is also interesting because even humans may not be perfectly accurate on these tasks. This allows us to compare errors made by humans and machines, in contrast to standard object detection tasks where human performance is nearly perfect. We have developed a novel face database of close to 1650 diverse Indian faces labeled for fine-grained race (South vs North India) as well as for age, weight, height and gender. We then asked close to 130 human subjects who were instructed to categorize each face as belonging toa Northern or Southern state in India. We then compared human performance on this task with that of computational models trained on the ground-truth labels. Our main results are as follows: (1) Humans are highly consistent (average accuracy: 63.6%), with some faces being consistently classified with > 90% accuracy and others consistently misclassified with < 30% accuracy; (2) Models trained on ground-truth labels showed slightly worse performance (average accuracy: 62%) but showed higher accuracy (72.2%) on faces classified with > 80% accuracy by humans. This was true for models trained on simple spatial and intensity measurements extracted from faces as well as deep neural networks trained on race or gender classification; (3) Using overcomplete banks of features derived from each face part, we found that mouth shape was the single largest contributor towards fine-grained race classification, whereas distances between face parts was the strongest predictor of gender.

面孔构成了人类各种各样判断的基础，但其基本特征仍然不甚了解。尽管种族内部的细微区别可能会更强烈地限制人类使用的可能的面部特征，而不是像种族或性别这样的粗糙的种类，但这种细微的区别相对较少地被研究。细粒度的种族分类也很有趣，因为甚至人类在这些任务上可能也不是很准确。这使我们能够比较人类和机器产生的错误，而人类的表现几乎完美的标准物体检测任务则相反。我们已经开发了一个新的脸部数据库，贴近1650个不同的印度面孔标签为细粒度种族（南与北印度）以及年龄，体重，身高和性别。然后，我们问了近130名人类受试者，他们被指示把每个脸部分类为属于印度的北方或南方的州。然后，我们将人类在这个任务上的表现与在地面实况标签上训练的计算模型进行比较。我们的主要结果如下：（1）人类高度一致（平均准确度：63.6％），一些人脸一直分类精度> 90％，其他人一直误分类，准确度<30％; （2）在地面实况标签上训练的模型表现出稍差的表现（平均准确度为62％），但对人类准确度> 80％的人脸表现出更高的准确性（72.2％）。这对于从面部提取的简单空间和强度测量以及在种族或性别分类上训练的深度神经网络进行训练的模型是正确的; （3）利用从每个脸部获得的超完备的特征组，我们发现嘴形是细粒度种族分类的唯一最大贡献者，而脸部部分之间的距离是性别的最强预测者。
