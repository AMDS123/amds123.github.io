##### Abstract
Studies in Referring Expression Generation (REG) often make use of corpora of definite descriptions produced by human subjects in controlled experiments. Experiments of this kind, which are essential for the study of reference phenomena and many others, may however include a considerable amount of noise. Human subjects may easily lack attention, or may simply misunderstand the task at hand and, as a result, the elicited data may include large proportions of ambiguous or ill-formed descriptions. In addition to that, REG corpora are usually collected for the study of semantics-related phenomena, and it is often the case that the elicited descriptions (and their input contexts) need to be annotated with their corresponding semantic properties. This, as in many other fields, may require considerable time and skilled annotators. As a means to tackle both kinds of difficulties - poor data quality and high annotation costs - this work discusses a semi-automatic method for the annotation of definite descriptions produced by human subjects in REG data collection experiments. The method makes use of simple rules to establish associations between words and meanings, and is intended to facilitate the design of experiments that produce REG corpora.

##### Abstract (translated by Google)
参考表达式生成（REG）中的研究经常利用在受控实验中由人类受试者产生的明确描述的语料库。然而，这种对参考现象和许多其他研究是必不可少的实验可能包括相当大的噪音。人类受试者可能很容易缺乏注意力，或者可能仅仅是误解了手头的任务，因此引起的数据可能包含大量模棱两可或形式不明的描述。除此之外，通常收集REG语料库用于研究与语义相关的现象，并且通常情况下引出的描述（及其输入上下文）需要用其相应的语义属性进行注释。与其他许多领域一样，这可能需要相当多的时间和熟练的注释者。作为解决这两种难题的一种手段 - 数据质量差和注释成本高 - 这项工作讨论了在REG数据收集实验中人类主体产生的明确描述注释的半自动方法。该方法利用简单的规则建立单词与意义之间的关联，旨在便于设计产生REG语料的实验。
