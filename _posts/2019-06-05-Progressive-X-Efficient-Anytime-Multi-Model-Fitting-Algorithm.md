##### Abstract
The Progressive-X algorithm, Prog-X in short, is proposed for geometric multi-model fitting. The method interleaves sampling and consolidation of the current data interpretation via repetitive hypothesis proposal, fast rejection, and integration of the new hypothesis into the kept instance set by labeling energy minimization. Due to exploring the data progressively, the method has several beneficial properties compared with the state-of-the-art. First, a clear criterion, adopted from RANSAC, controls the termination and stops the algorithm when the probability of finding a new model with a reasonable number of inliers falls below a threshold. Second, Prog-X is an any-time algorithm. Thus, whenever is interrupted, e.g. due to a time limit, the returned instances cover real and, likely, the most dominant ones. The method is superior to the state-of-the-art in terms of accuracy in both synthetic experiments and on publicly available real-world datasets for homography, two-view motion, and motion segmentation.
