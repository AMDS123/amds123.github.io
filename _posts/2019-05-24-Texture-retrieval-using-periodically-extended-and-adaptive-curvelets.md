##### Abstract
Image retrieval is an important problem in the area of multimedia processing. This paper presents two new curvelet-based algorithms for texture retrieval which are suitable for use in constrained-memory devices. The developed algorithms are tested on three publicly available texture datasets: CUReT, Mondial-Marmi, and STex-fabric. Our experiments confirm the effectiveness of the proposed system. Furthermore, a weighted version of the proposed retrieval algorithm is proposed, which is shown to achieve promising results in the classification of seismic activities.
