##### Abstract
In recent years, car makers and tech companies have been racing towards self driving cars. It seems that the main parameter in this race is who will have the first car on the road. The goal of this paper is to add to the equation two additional crucial parameters. The first is standardization of safety assurance --- what are the minimal requirements that every self-driving car must satisfy, and how can we verify these requirements. The second parameter is scalability --- engineering solutions that lead to unleashed costs will not scale to millions of cars, which will push interest in this field into a niche academic corner, and drive the entire field into a "winter of autonomous driving". In the first part of the paper we propose a white-box, interpretable, mathematical model for safety assurance, which we call Responsibility-Sensitive Safety (RSS). In the second part we describe a design of a system that adheres to our safety assurance requirements and is scalable to millions of cars.

近年来，汽车制造商和科技公司一直在争抢自驾车。看来这场比赛的主要参数是谁将有第一辆车在路上。这篇论文的目的是给方程增加两个额外的关键参数。首先是安全保证的标准化 - 每辆自驾车必须满足哪些最低要求，以及如何验证这些要求。第二个参数是可扩展性---导致成本下降的工程解决方案不会扩展到数百万辆汽车，这将把这个领域的兴趣推到一个狭小的学术角落，并将整个领域推向“自动驾驶的冬天”。在本文的第一部分中，我们提出了一个白皮书，可解释的安全保证数学模型，我们称之为责任敏感安全（RSS）。在第二部分中，我们描述了符合我们安全保证要求的系统设计，并且可以扩展到数百万辆汽车。
