##### Abstract
Rapid increase in internet users along with growing power of online review sites and social media has given birth to sentiment analysis or opinion mining, which aims at determining what other people think and comment. Sentiments or Opinions contain public generated content about products, services, policies and politics. People are usually interested to seek positive and negative opinions containing likes and dislikes, shared by users for features of particular product or service. This paper proposed sentence-level lexical based domain independent sentiment classification method for different types of data such as reviews and blogs. The proposed method is based on general lexicons i.e. WordNet, SentiWordNet and user defined lexical dictionaries for semantic orientation. The relations and glosses of these dictionaries provide solution to the domain portability problem. The method performs better than word and text level corpus based machine learning methods for semantic orientation. The results show the proposed method performs better as it shows precision of 87% and83% at document and sentence levels respectively for online comments.

随着在线评论网站和社交媒体日益增长的力量，互联网用户的快速增长催生了情感分析或意见挖掘，旨在确定其他人的想法和评论。情感或观点包含公共生成的关于产品，服务，政策和政治的内容。人们通常有兴趣寻求包含好恶的正面和负面的意见，由用户分享特定产品或服务的特征。本文针对评论和博客等不同类型的数据，提出了基于句法级别词法的领域独立情感分类方法。所提出的方法基于通用词典，即WordNet，SentiWordNet和用户定义的用于语义定向的词典词典。这些字典的关系和密码为域可移植性问题提供了解决方案。该方法比单词和文本级别的基于语料的机器学习方法具有更好的语义定位性能。结果表明，所提出的方法在网上评论中分别显示87％和83％的文档和句子水平的精度，表现更好。
