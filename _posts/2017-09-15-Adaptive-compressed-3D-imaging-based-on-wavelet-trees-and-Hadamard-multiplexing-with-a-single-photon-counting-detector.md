##### Abstract
Photon counting 3D imaging allows to obtain 3D images with single-photon sensitivity and sub-ns temporal resolution. However, it is challenging to scale to high spatial resolution. In this work, we demonstrate a photon counting 3D imaging technique with short-pulsed structured illumination and a single-pixel photon counting detector. The proposed multi-resolution photon counting 3D imaging technique acquires a high-resolution 3D image from a coarse image and edges at successfully finer resolution sampled by Hadamard multiplexing along the wavelet trees. The detected power is significantly increased thanks to the Hadamard multiplexing. Both the required measurements and the reconstruction time can be significantly reduced by performing wavelet-tree-based regions of edges predication and Hadamard demultiplexing, which makes the proposed technique suitable for scenes with high spatial resolution. The experimental results indicate that a 3D image at resolution up to 512*512 pixels can be acquired and retrieved with practical time as low as 17 seconds.

光子计数3D成像允许获得具有单光子灵敏度和子ns时间分辨率的3D图像。然而，扩展到高空间分辨率是一个挑战。在这项工作中，我们展示了光子计数三维成像技术与短脉冲结构照明和单像素光子计数检测器。所提出的多分辨率光子计数三维成像技术从粗糙图像获得高分辨率3D图像，并且沿着小波树通过Hadamard多路复用成功地获得更高分辨率的边缘。由于哈达玛复用，检测到的功率显着增加。通过执行边缘预测和Hadamard解复用的基于小波树的区域，可以显着减少所需的测量和重建时间，这使得所提出的技术适用于具有高空间分辨率的场景。实验结果表明，分辨率高达512×512像素的3D图像可以在17秒的实际时间内被采集和检索。
