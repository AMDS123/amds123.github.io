##### Abstract
This paper describes an automatic process for combining patterns and features, to guide a search process and make predictions. It is based on the functionality that a human brain might have, which is a highly distributed network of simple neuronal components that can apply some level of matching and cross-referencing over retrieved patterns. The process uses memory in a dynamic way and it is directed through the pattern matching. The first half of the paper describes the mechanisms for neuronal search, memory and prediction. The second half of the paper then presents a formal language for defining cognitive processes, that is, pattern-based sequences and transitions. The language can define an outer framework for nested pattern sets that can be linked to perform the cognitive act. The language also has a mathematical basis, allowing for the rule construction process to be systematic and consistent. The paper then puts the new ideas into the context of the cognitive model.
