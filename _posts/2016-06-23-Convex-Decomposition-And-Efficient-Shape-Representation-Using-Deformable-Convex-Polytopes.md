##### Abstract
Decomposition of shapes into (approximate) convex parts is essential for applications such as part-based shape representation, shape matching, and collision detection. In this paper, we propose a novel convex decomposition using a parametric implicit shape model called Disjunctive Normal Shape Model (DNSM). The DNSM is formed as a union of polytopes which themselves are formed by intersections of halfspaces. The key idea is by deforming the polytopes, which naturally remain convex during the evolution, the polytopes capture convex parts without the need to compute convexity. The major contributions of this paper include a robust convex decomposition which also results in an efficient part-based shape representation, and a novel shape convexity measure. The experimental results show the potential of the proposed method.

将形状分解成（近似）凸起部分对于基于部件的形状表示，形状匹配和碰撞检测等应用是必不可少的。在本文中，我们提出了一种新的使用称为析取正常形状模型（DNSM）的参数隐式形状模型的凸分解。 DNSM被形成为多面体的联合体，它们本身是由半空间的交叉形成的。关键的想法是通过使多面体变形，在演化过程中自然保持凸面，多面体捕捉凸面部分而不需要计算凸面。本文的主要贡献包括一个稳健的凸分解，也导致了一个有效的基于零件的形状表示，以及一个新的形状凸性度量。实验结果表明了该方法的潜力。
