##### Abstract
In this paper we present a new method for shape recognition based on dynamic programming. First, each contour of shape is represented by a set of points. After alignment and matching between two shapes, the outline of the shape is divided into parts according to N angular and M radial sectors , Each Sector contains a portion of the contour; this portion is divided at the inflexion points into convex and concave sections, and the information about sections are extracted in order to provide a semantic content to the outline shape, then this information are coded and transformed into a string of symbols. Finally we find the best alignment of two complete strings and compute the optimal cost of similarity. The algorithm has been tested on a large set of shape databases and real images (MPEG-7, natural silhouette database).
