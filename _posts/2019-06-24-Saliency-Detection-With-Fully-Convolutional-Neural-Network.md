##### Abstract
Saliency detection is an important task in image processing as it can solve many problems and it usually is the first step in for other processes. Convolutional neural networks have been proved to be very effective on several image processing tasks such as classification, segmentation, semantic colorization and object manipulation. Besides, using the weights of a pretrained networks is a common practice for enhancing the accuracy of a network. In this paper a fully convolutional neural network which uses a part of VGG-16 is proposed for saliency detection in images.
