##### Abstract
Cellular Automata (CA) have been considered one of the most pronounced parallel computational tools in the recent era of nature and bio-inspired computing. Taking advantage of their local connectivity, the simplicity of their design and their inherent parallelism, CA can be effectively applied to many image processing tasks. In this paper, a CA approach for efficient salt-n-pepper noise filtering in grayscale images is presented. Using a 2D Moore neighborhood, the classified "noisy" cells are corrected by averaging the non-noisy neighboring cells. While keeping the computational burden really low, the proposed approach succeeds in removing high-noise levels from various images and yields promising qualitative and quantitative results, compared to state-of-the-art techniques.

元胞自动机（CA）被认为是最近在自然界和生物启发计算时代最显着的并行计算工具之一。利用它们的局部连通性，设计的简单性和固有的并行性，CA可以有效地应用于许多图像处理任务。本文提出了一种用于灰度图像高效椒盐噪声滤波的CA方法。使用2D摩尔邻域，通过平均非噪声相邻单元来校正分类的“噪声”单元。在保持计算负担真的很低的同时，与最先进的技术相比，所提出的方法成功地消除了来自各种图像的高噪声水平，并产生了有希望的定性和定量结果。
