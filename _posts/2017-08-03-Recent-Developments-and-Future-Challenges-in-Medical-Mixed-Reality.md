##### Abstract
Mixed Reality (MR) is of increasing interest within technology-driven modern medicine but is not yet used in everyday practice. This situation is changing rapidly, however, and this paper explores the emergence of MR technology and the importance of its utility within medical applications. A classification of medical MR has been obtained by applying an unbiased text mining method to a database of 1,403 relevant research papers published over the last two decades. The classification results reveal a taxonomy for the development of medical MR research during this period as well as suggesting future trends. We then use the classification to analyse the technology and applications developed in the last five years. Our objective is to aid researchers to focus on the areas where technology advancements in medical MR are most needed, as well as providing medical practitioners with a useful source of reference.

混合现实（MR）在技术驱动的现代医学中越来越受到关注，但在日常实践中尚未被使用。然而，这种情况正在迅速变化，本文探讨了MR技术的出现及其在医学应用中的重要性。通过对过去二十年发表的1,403篇相关研究论文的数据库应用无偏差文本挖掘方法，获得了医学MR分类。分类结果揭示了这一时期医学MR研究的发展分类，并提出了未来趋势。然后，我们使用分类来分析过去五年中开发的技术和应用。我们的目标是帮助研究人员把重点放在最需要医学MR技术进步的领域，并为医疗人员提供有用的参考资料。
