##### Abstract
In multiagent systems (MASs), each agent makes individual decisions but all of them contribute globally to the system evolution. Learning in MASs is difficult since the selection of actions must take place in the presence of other co-learning agents. Moreover, the environmental stochasticity and uncertainties increase exponentially with the number of agents. A number of previous works borrow various multiagent coordination mechanisms into deep multiagent learning architecture to facilitate multiagent coordination. However, none of them explicitly consider action semantics between agents. In this paper, we propose a novel network architecture, named Action Semantics Network (ASN), that explicitly represents such action semantics between agents. ASN characterizes different actions' influence on other agents using neural networks based on the action semantics between agents. ASN can be easily combined with existing deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithms to boost their performance. Experimental results on StarCraft II and Neural MMO show ASN significantly improves the performance of state-of-the-art DRL approaches compared with a number of network architectures.
