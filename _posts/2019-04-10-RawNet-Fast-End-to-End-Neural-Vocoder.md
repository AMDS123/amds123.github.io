##### Abstract
Neural networks based vocoders have recently demonstrated the powerful ability to synthesize high quality speech. These models usually generate samples by conditioning on some spectrum features, such as Mel-spectrum. However, these features are extracted by using speech analysis module including some processing based on the human knowledge. In this work, we proposed RawNet, a truly end-to-end neural vocoder, which use a coder network to learn the higher representation of signal, and an autoregressive voder network to generate speech sample by sample. The coder and voder together act like an auto-encoder network, and could be jointly trained directly on raw waveform without any human-designed features. The experiments on the Copy-Synthesis tasks show that RawNet can achieve the comparative synthesized speech quality with LPCNet, with a smaller model architecture and faster speech generation at the inference step.
