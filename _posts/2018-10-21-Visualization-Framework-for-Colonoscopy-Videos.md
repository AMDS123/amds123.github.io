##### Abstract
We present a visualization framework for annotating and comparing colonoscopy videos, where these annotations can then be used for semi-automatic report generation at the end of the procedure. Currently, there are approximately 14 million colonoscopies performed every year in the US. In this work, we create a visualization tool to deal with the deluge of colonoscopy videos in a more effective way. We present an interactive visualization framework for the annotation and tagging of colonoscopy videos in an easy and intuitive way. These annotations and tags can later be used for report generation for electronic medical records and for comparison at an individual as well as group level. We also present important use cases and medical expert feedback for our visualization framework.
