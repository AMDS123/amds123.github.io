##### Abstract
Polarization is an important property of GaN/AlN multi-quantum-well (MQW) avalanche diode (MAPD) but has been ignored in recent analyses of MAPD to simplify the Monte Carlo simulation. Here, the photocurrent characteristics of GaN/AlN MAPD are investigated to understand the role of polarization field in the MQW structure. Carrier multiplication in AlN/GaN MAPD is found as a result of interfacial impact ionization not much helped from external field but instead considerably contributed by the polarization field. In addition, the movement of ionized electrons out of quantum well is proved as Fowler-Nordheim tunneling process helped by the polarization field in AlN barrier. Furthermore, the transport of ionized electrons through MQW structure is found influenced by the reverse polarization field in GaN layer, which could be suppressed by the external electric field. With all the three effects, the quick photocurrent increase of GaN/AlN MAPD is ascribed to the efficient transport of interfacial-ionized electrons step by step out of MQW at high voltages, which is in big difference from conventional APD due to avalanche breakdown.

极化是GaN / AlN多量子阱（MQW）雪崩二极管（MAPD）的重要特性，但在最近的MAPD分析中被忽略以简化蒙特卡罗模拟。这里，研究了GaN / AlN MAPD的光电流特性，以了解极化场在MQW结构中的作用。发现AlN / GaN MAPD中的载流子倍增是界面碰撞电离的结果，而外部场没有太大帮助，而是由极化场引起的。此外，离子化电子从量子阱中的运动被证明为Fowler-Nordheim隧穿过程有助于AlN势垒中的极化场。此外，发现电离电子通过MQW结构的传输受到GaN层中的反向极化场的影响，这可以通过外部电场来抑制。由于所有这三种效应，GaN / AlN MAPD的快速光电流增加归因于MQW在高电压下逐步有效地传输界面电离电子，这与由于雪崩击穿导致的传统APD有很大不同。
