##### Abstract
The properties of an entangled two-photon state antisymmetric in frequencies are studied. At a beam-splitter, two entangled photons are perfectly anti-correlated. In addition, they cannot be detected at the same time instant despite the fact that their detection times are confined to a narrow time window, i.e. they are temporally anti-bunched. Using nonlinear photonic-band-gap structures made of GaN/AlN, two schemes for generating such states are described.
