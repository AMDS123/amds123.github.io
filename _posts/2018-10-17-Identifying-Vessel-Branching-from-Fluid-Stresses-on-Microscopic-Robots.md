##### Abstract
Objects moving in fluids experience patterns of stress on their surfaces determined by the geometry of nearby boundaries. Flows at low Reynolds number, as occur in microscopic vessels such as capillaries in biological tissues, have relatively simple relations between stresses and nearby vessel geometry. Using these relations, this paper shows how a microscopic robot moving with such flows can use changes in stress on its surface to identify when it encounters vessel branches.
