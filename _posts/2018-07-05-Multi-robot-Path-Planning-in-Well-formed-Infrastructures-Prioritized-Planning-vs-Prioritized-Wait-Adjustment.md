##### Abstract
We study the problem of planning collision-free paths for a group of homogeneous robots. We propose a novel approach for turning the paths that were planned egocentrically by the robots, e.g. without taking other robots' moves into account, into collision-free trajectories and evaluate it empirically. Suggested algorithm is much faster (up to one order of magnitude) than state-of-the-art but this comes at the price of notable drop-down of the solution cost.

我们研究了为一组均匀机器人规划无碰撞路径的问题。我们提出了一种新方法来转动机器人以自我为中心计划的路径，例如不考虑其他机器人的动作，进入无碰撞轨迹并根据经验进行评估。建议的算法比现有技术更快（达到一个数量级），但这是以降低解决方案成本的代价为代价的。
