##### Abstract
Reinforcement Learning, a machine learning framework for training an autonomous agent based on rewards, has shown outstanding results in various domains. However, it is known that learning a good policy is difficult in a domain where rewards are rare. We propose a method, optimistic proximal policy optimization (OPPO) to alleviate this difficulty. OPPO considers the uncertainty of the estimated total return and optimistically evaluates the policy based on that amount. We show that OPPO outperforms the existing methods in a tabular task.
