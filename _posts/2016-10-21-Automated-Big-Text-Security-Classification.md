##### Abstract
In recent years, traditional cybersecurity safeguards have proven ineffective against insider threats. Famous cases of sensitive information leaks caused by insiders, including the WikiLeaks release of diplomatic cables and the Edward Snowden incident, have greatly harmed the U.S. government's relationship with other governments and with its own citizens. Data Leak Prevention (DLP) is a solution for detecting and preventing information leaks from within an organization's network. However, state-of-art DLP detection models are only able to detect very limited types of sensitive information, and research in the field has been hindered due to the lack of available sensitive texts. Many researchers have focused on document-based detection with artificially labeled "confidential documents" for which security labels are assigned to the entire document, when in reality only a portion of the document is sensitive. This type of whole-document based security labeling increases the chances of preventing authorized users from accessing non-sensitive information within sensitive documents. In this paper, we introduce Automated Classification Enabled by Security Similarity (ACESS), a new and innovative detection model that penetrates the complexity of big text security classification/detection. To analyze the ACESS system, we constructed a novel dataset, containing formerly classified paragraphs from diplomatic cables made public by the WikiLeaks organization. To our knowledge this paper is the first to analyze a dataset that contains actual formerly sensitive information annotated at paragraph granularity.

##### Abstract (translated by Google)
近年来，传统的网络安全防护已经被证明对内部威胁无效。知情人士泄露的知情案件，包括维基解密公布的外交电报和爱德华·斯诺登事件，都严重损害了美国政府与其他政府和本国公民的关系。数据泄漏防护（DLP）是检测和防止组织网络内部信息泄露的解决方案。但是，最先进的DLP检测模型只能检测非常有限类型的敏感信息，而且由于缺乏可用的敏感文本而阻碍了该领域的研究。许多研究人员把重点放在基于文档的检测上，并在人为标注的“机密文档”中为整个文档分配了安全标签，而实际上只有一部分文档是敏感的。这种基于全文档的安全标签增加了防止授权用户访问敏感文档中的非敏感信息的可能性。在本文中，我们介绍一种安全相似性自动分类技术（ACESS），这是一种新型的，创新的检测模型，能够渗透大型文本安全分类/检测的复杂性。为了分析ACESS系统，我们构建了一个新的数据集，其中包含维基解密组织公布的外交电报的以前分类的段落。据我们所知，这篇论文是第一个分析数据集的，它包含了以段落粒度标注的实际以前的敏感信息。
