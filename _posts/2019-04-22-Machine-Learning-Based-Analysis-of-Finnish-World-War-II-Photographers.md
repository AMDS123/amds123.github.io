##### Abstract
In this paper, we demonstrate the benefits of using state-of-the-art machine learning methods in the analysis of historical photo archives. Specifically, we analyze prominent Finnish World War II photographers, who have captured high numbers of photographs in the publicly available SA photo archive, which contains 160,000 photographs from Finnish Winter, Continuation, and Lapland Wars captures in 1939-1945. We were able to find some special characteristics for different photographers in terms of their typical photo content and photo types (e.g., close-ups vs. overview images, number of people). Furthermore, we managed to train a neural network that can successfully recognize the photographer from some of the photos, which shows that such photos are indeed characteristic for certain photographers. We further analyze the similarities and differences between the photographers using the features extracted from the photographer classifier network. All the extracted information will help historical and societal studies over the photo archive.
