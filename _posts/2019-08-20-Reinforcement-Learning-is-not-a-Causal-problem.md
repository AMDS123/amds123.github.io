##### Abstract
We use an analogy between non-isomorphic mathematical structures defined over the same set and the algebras induced by associative and causal levels of information in order to argue that Reinforcement Learning, in its current formulation, is not a causal problem, independently if the motivation behind it has to do with an agent taking actions.
