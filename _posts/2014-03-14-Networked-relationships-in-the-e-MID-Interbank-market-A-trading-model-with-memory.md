##### Abstract
Interbank markets are fundamental for bank liquidity management. In this paper, we introduce a model of interbank trading with memory. Our model reproduces features of preferential trading patterns in the e-MID market recently empirically observed through the method of statistically validated networks. The memory mechanism is used to introduce a proxy of trust in the model. The key idea is that a lender, having lent many times to a borrower in the past, is more likely to lend to that borrower again in the future than to other borrowers, with which the lender has never (or has in- frequently) interacted. The core of the model depends on only one parameter representing the initial attractiveness of all the banks as borrowers. Model outcomes and real data are compared through a variety of measures that describe the structure and properties of trading networks, including number of statistically validated links, bidirectional links, and 3-motifs. Refinements of the pairing method are also proposed, in order to capture finite memory and reciprocity in the model. The model is implemented within the Mason framework in Java.

银行间市场是银行流动性管理的基础。在本文中，我们引入了一个带有记忆的银行间交易模型。我们的模型再现了e-MID市场中最近通过统计验证网络的方法经验性地观察到的优惠交易模式的特征。记忆机制被用来在模型中引入信任的代理。关键的想法是，贷款人过去多次借给借款人的贷款人更有可能在未来再次借给借款人，而不是其他贷款人与贷款人从未（或不经常）交往的借款人。模型的核心只取决于一个参数，代表所有银行作为借款人的初始吸引力。通过描述交易网络的结构和性质的各种措施比较模型结果和实际数据，包括经过统计验证的链接的数量，双向链接和3个图案。也提出了配对方法的细化，以便捕捉模型中的有限记忆和互惠。该模型在Java的Mason框架内实现。
