##### Abstract
The Multi-target Challenge aims to assess how well current speech technology is able to determine whether or not a recorded utterance was spoken by one of a large number of blacklisted speakers. It is a form of multi-target speaker detection based on real-world telephone conversations. Data recordings are generated from call center customer-agent conversations. The task is to measure how accurately one can detect 1) whether a test recording is spoken by a blacklisted speaker, and 2) which specific blacklisted speaker was talking. This paper outlines the challenge and provides its baselines, results, and discussions.
