##### Abstract
In this paper, we introduce the task of targeted aspect-based sentiment analysis. The goal is to extract fine-grained information with respect to entities mentioned in user comments. This work extends both aspect-based sentiment analysis that assumes a single entity per document and targeted sentiment analysis that assumes a single sentiment towards a target entity. In particular, we identify the sentiment towards each aspect of one or more entities. As a testbed for this task, we introduce the SentiHood dataset, extracted from a question answering (QA) platform where urban neighbourhoods are discussed by users. In this context units of text often mention several aspects of one or more neighbourhoods. This is the first time that a generic social media platform in this case a QA platform, is used for fine-grained opinion mining. Text coming from QA platforms is far less constrained compared to text from review specific platforms which current datasets are based on. We develop several strong baselines, relying on logistic regression and state-of-the-art recurrent neural networks.

在本文中，我们将介绍面向方面情感分析的任务。目标是提取关于用户评论中提到的实体的细粒度信息。这项工作扩展了基于方面的情感分析，假设每个文档有单个实体，而目标情感分析则假设对目标实体有单一的情感。特别是，我们确定对一个或多个实体的每个方面的情绪。作为这个任务的测试平台，我们介绍SentiHood数据集，从用户讨论城市社区的问答（QA）平台提取。在这种情况下，文本单元经常提到一个或多个社区的几个方面。这是在这种情况下，一个通用的社交媒体平台QA平台首次用于细粒度的意见挖掘。与来自QA平台的文本相比，当前数据集所基于的评估特定平台的文本要少得多。我们依靠逻辑回归和最先进的递归神经网络开发了几个强大的基线。
