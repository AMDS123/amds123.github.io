##### Abstract
Variously stained histology slices are routinely used by pathologists to assess extracted tissue samples from various anatomical sites and determine the presence or extent of a disease. Evaluation of sequential slides is expected to enable a better understanding of the spatial arrangement and growth patterns of cells and vessels. In this paper we present a practical two-step approach based on diffeomorphic registration to align digitized sequential histopathology stained slides to each other, starting with an initial affine step followed by the estimation of a detailed deformation field.
