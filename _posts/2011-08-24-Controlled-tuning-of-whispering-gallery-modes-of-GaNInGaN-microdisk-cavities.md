##### Abstract
Controlled tuning of the whispering gallery modes of GaN/InGaN {\mu}-disk cavities is demonstrated. The whispering gallery mode (WGM) tuning is achieved at room temperature by immersing the {\mu}-disks in water and irradiating with ultraviolet (UV) laser. The tuning rate can be controlled by varying the laser excitation power, with a nanometer precision accessible at low excitation power (~ several {\mu}W). The selective oxidation mechanism is proposed to explain the results and supported by theoretical analysis. The tuning of WGMs in GaN/InGaN {\mu}-disk cavities may have important implication in cavity quantum electrodynamics and the development of efficient light emitting devices.
