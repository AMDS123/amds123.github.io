##### Abstract
Recently developed model allows for simulations of electric field influence on the surface states. The results of slab simulations show considerable change of the energy of quantum states in the electric field, i.e. Stark Effect associated with the surface (SSSE - Surface States Stark Effect). Detailed studies of the GaN slabs demonstrate spatial variation of the conduction and valence band energy revealing real nature of SSSE phenomenon. It is shown that long range variation of the electric potential is in accordance with the change of the energy of the conduction and valence bands. However, at short distances from GaN(0001) surface, the valence band follows the potential change while the conduction states energy is increased due to quantum overlap repulsion by surface states. It is also shown that at clean GaN(0001) surface Fermi level is pinned at about 0.34 eV below the long range projection of the conduction band bottom and varies with the field by about 0.31 eV due to electron filling of the surface states.

最近开发的模型允许模拟电场对表面状态的影响。平板模拟的结果显示了电场中量子态的能量，即与表面相关的斯塔克效应（SSSE-表面态斯塔克效应）的相当大的变化。详细的氮化镓板研究证明了传导和价带能量的空间变化，揭示了SSSE现象的真实性。结果表明，电位的长程变化与导带和价带能量的变化相一致。然而，在离GaN（0001）表面很近的距离处，价带遵循电势变化，而导电态能量由于表面态的量子重叠排斥而增加。还表明，在干净的GaN（0001）表面，费米能级被钉扎在导带底部的长范围投影下约0.34eV，并且由于表面态的电子填充而随着场改变约0.31eV。
