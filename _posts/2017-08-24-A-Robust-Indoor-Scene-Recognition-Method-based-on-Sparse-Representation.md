##### Abstract
In this paper, we present a robust method for scene recognition, which leverages Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) features and Sparse Coding setting by creating a new representation of indoor scenes. Although CNNs highly benefited the fields of computer vision and pattern recognition, convolutional layers adjust weights on a global-approach, which might lead to losing important local details such as objects and small structures. Our proposed scene representation relies on both: global features that mostly refers to environment's structure, and local features that are sparsely combined to capture characteristics of common objects of a given scene. This new representation is based on fragments of the scene and leverages features extracted by CNNs. The experimental evaluation shows that the resulting representation outperforms previous scene recognition methods on Scene15 and MIT67 datasets, and performs competitively on SUN397, while being highly robust to perturbations in the input image such as noise and occlusion.

在本文中，我们提出了一个强大的场景识别方法，利用卷积神经网络（CNNs）特征和稀疏编码设置，创建一个室内场景的新表示。尽管CNN在计算机视觉和模式识别领域受益匪浅，但是卷积层依靠全局方法来调整权重，这可能导致丢失重要的局部细节，如对象和小型结构。我们提出的场景表示依赖于：主要指环境结构的全局特征和稀疏组合的局部特征，以捕捉给定场景的共同对象的特征。这个新的表示是基于场景的片段，并利用CNN提取的特征。实验评估表明，结果表现优于Scene15和MIT67数据集上的先前场景识别方法，并在SUN397上具有竞争力，同时对噪声和遮挡等输入图像具有很强的鲁棒性。
