##### Abstract
Automatically solving mathematical word problems (MWPs) is challenging, primarily due to the semantic gap between human-readable words and machine-understandable logics. Despite a long history dated back to the 1960s, MWPs has regained intensive attention in the past few years with the advancement of Artificial Intelligence (AI). To solve MWPs successfully is considered as a milestone towards general AI. Many systems have claimed promising results in self-crafted and small-scale datasets. However, when applied on large and diverse datasets, none of the proposed methods in the literatures achieves a high precision, revealing that current MWPs solvers are still far from intelligent. This motivated us to present a comprehensive survey to deliver a clear and complete picture of automatic math problem solvers. In this survey, we emphasize on algebraic word problems, summarize their extracted features and proposed techniques to bridge the semantic gap, and compare their performance in the publicly accessible datasets. We will also cover automatic solvers for other types of math problems such as geometric problems that require the understanding of diagrams. Finally, we will identify several emerging research directions for the readers with interests in MWPs.

##### Abstract (translated by Google)
自动解决数学单词问题（MWP）具有挑战性，主要是由于人类可读单词和机器可理解逻辑之间的语义差异。尽管历史可以追溯到20世纪60年代，但随着人工智能（AI）的发展，MWP在过去几年中已经重新受到关注。成功解决MWP被认为是普通AI的里程碑。许多系统在自制和小规模数据集中声称有希望的结果。然而，当应用于大型和多样化的数据集时，文献中提出的方法都没有达到高精度，这表明当前的MWP求解器仍远未智能化。这促使我们提供全面的调查，以提供自动数学问题解决者的清晰和完整的图片。在本次调查中，我们强调代数词问题，总结其提取的特征和提出的技术，以弥合语义差距，并比较它们在公共可访问数据集中的表现。我们还将介绍其他类型数学问题的自动求解器，例如需要理解图表的几何问题。最后，我们将为对MWP感兴趣的读者确定几个新兴的研究方向。
