##### Abstract
The ability to live without being controlled by any action, judgment and any outside factors including any opinions and regulations is defined by the term Independent. But in reality physical movement for travelling or simply walking through a crowded street pose great challenge for a visually impaired person. Also they must learn every detail about the home environment such as placement of tables; chairs etc. to prevent injury. Because of this disability they have to sacrifice their independence in daily living by depending on the sighted people in every busy place like bus, footpaths, railway stations etc. This paper aims to design an artificial navigating system with adjustable sensitivity with the help of ultrasonic proximity sensor to assist these blind persons to walk fearlessly and independently in both indoor and outdoor environment. This system can detect any type of upcoming obstacles and potholes using the reflection properties of ultrasound. Attachment of the system to different body areas makes its utilization more versatile and reliable.
