##### Abstract
The Wireless Capsule Endoscopy (WCE) is becoming a popular way of screening gastrointestinal system diseases and cancer. However, the time-consuming process in inspecting WCE data limits its applications and increases the cost of examinations. This paper considers WCE-based gastric ulcer detection, in which the major challenge is to detect the lesions in a local region. We propose an approach named infinite curriculum learning, which generalizes curriculum learning to an infinite sampling space by approximately measuring the difficulty of each patch by its scale. This allows us to adapt our model from local patches to global images gradually, leading to a consistent accuracy gain. Experiments are performed on a large dataset with more than 3 million WCE images. Our approach achieves a binary classification accuracy of 87%, and is able to detect some lesions mis-annotated by the physicians. In a real-world application, our approach can reduce the workload of a physician by 90%-98% in gastric ulcer screening.

无线胶囊内窥镜（WCE）正成为筛查胃肠系统疾病和癌症的流行方式。然而，检查WCE数据的耗时过程限制了其应用并增加了检查的成本。本文考虑了基于WCE的胃溃疡检测，其中主要的挑战是检测局部区域的病变。我们提出了一种名为无限课程学习的方法，通过大致按比例测量每个补丁的难度，将课程学习概括为无限的采样空间。这使我们能够逐步调整我们的模型，从局部补丁到全局图像，从而获得一致的精度增益。在具有超过300万个WCE图像的大型数据集上执行实验。我们的方法实现了87％的二元分类准确度，并且能够检测医生错误注释的一些病变。在实际应用中，我们的方法可以将胃溃疡筛查中医生的工作量减少90％-98％。
