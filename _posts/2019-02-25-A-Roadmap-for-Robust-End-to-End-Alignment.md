##### Abstract
We analyze the AI alignment problem. This is the problem of aligning an AI's objective function with human preferences. This problem has been argued to be critical to AI safety, especially in the long run. But it has also been argued that solving it robustly is extremely challenging, especially in highly complex environments like the Internet. It seems crucial to accelerate research in this direction. 
 To this end, we propose a preliminary research program. Our roadmap aims to decompose alignment into numerous more tractable subproblems. Our hope is that this will help scholars, engineers and decision-makers to better grasp the upcoming difficulties, and to foresee how they can best contribute to the global effort.
