##### Abstract
The problem of correctly segmenting touching characters is an hard task to solve and it is of major relevance in pattern recognition. In the recent years, many methods and algorithms have been proposed; still, a definitive solution is far from being found. In this paper, we propose a novel method based on fuzzy logic. The proposed method combines in a novel way three features for segmenting touching characters that have been already proposed in other studies but have been exploited only singularly so far. The proposed strategy is based on a 3--input/1--output fuzzy inference system with fuzzy rules specifically optimized for segmenting touching characters in the case of Latin printed and handwritten characters. The system performances are illustrated and supported by numerical examples showing that our approach can achieve a reasonable good overall accuracy in segmenting characters even on tricky conditions of touching characters. Moreover, numerical results suggest that the method can be applied to many different datasets of characters by means of a convenient tuning of the fuzzy sets and rules.

正确分割字符的问题是一个难以解决的问题，在模式识别中具有重要的意义。近年来，已经提出了许多方法和算法;仍然没有找到明确的解决办法。在本文中，我们提出了一种基于模糊逻辑的新方法。所提出的方法以新颖的方式结合了用于分割触摸字符的三个特征，这些特征在其他研究中已经被提出，但是迄今为止仅被单独利用。所提出的策略是基于一个3输入/ 1输出的模糊推理系统，该模糊推理系统在拉丁语和手写字符的情况下，特别优化了用于分割触摸字符的模糊规则。通过数值例子说明和支持系统性能，表明我们的方法即使在触摸字符的棘手条件下也能够实现对字符分割的合理良好的总体精度。此外，数值结果表明，该方法可以适用于许多不同的字符数据集，方便调整模糊集和规则。
