##### Abstract
Traffic scene recognition is an important and challenging issue in Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS). Recently, Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models have achieved great success in many applications, including scene classification. The remarkable representational learning capability of CNN remains to be further explored for solving real-world problems. Vector of Locally Aggregated Descriptors (VLAD) encoding has also proved to be a powerful method in catching global contextual information. In this paper, we attempted to solve the traffic scene recognition problem by combining the features representational capabilities of CNN with the VLAD encoding scheme. More specifically, the CNN features of image patches generated by a region proposal algorithm are encoded by applying VLAD, which subsequently represent an image in a compact representation. To catch the spatial information, spatial pyramids are exploited to encode CNN features. We experimented with a dataset of 10 categories of traffic scenes, with satisfactory categorization performances.

智能交通系统（ITS）中的交通场景识别是一个重要且具有挑战性的问题。最近，卷积神经网络（CNN）模型在包括场景分类在内的许多应用中取得了巨大的成功。 CNN的显着代表性学习能力还有待进一步探索解决现实世界的问题。本地聚合描述符（VLAD）编码矢量也被证明是捕捉全局上下文信息的有效方法。本文试图通过将CNN的特征表示能力与VLAD编码方案相结合来解决交通场景识别问题。更具体地说，由区域提议算法产生的图像块的CNN特征通过应用VLAD进行编码，所述VLAD随后以紧凑表示来表示图像。为了捕捉空间信息，空间金字塔被用来编码CNN特征。我们对10类交通场景数据集进行了实验，分类效果令人满意。
