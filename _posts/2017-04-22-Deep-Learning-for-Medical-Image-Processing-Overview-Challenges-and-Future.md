##### Abstract
Healthcare sector is totally different from other industry. It is on high priority sector and people expect highest level of care and services regardless of cost. It did not achieve social expectation even though it consume huge percentage of budget. Mostly the interpretations of medical data is being done by medical expert. In terms of image interpretation by human expert, it is quite limited due to its subjectivity, the complexity of the image, extensive variations exist across different interpreters, and fatigue. After the success of deep learning in other real world application, it is also providing exciting solutions with good accuracy for medical imaging and is seen as a key method for future applications in health secotr. In this chapter, we discussed state of the art deep learning architecture and its optimization used for medical image segmentation and classification. In the last section, we have discussed the challenges deep learning based methods for medical imaging and open research issue.

##### Abstract (translated by Google)
医疗行业与其他行业完全不同。这是高度重视的部门，人们期望最高水平的护理和服务，无论成本如何。即使消耗了大量的预算，也没有达到社会期望。医疗数据的解释大多由医学专家来完成。就人类专家的形象解读而言，由于其主观性，形象的复杂性，不同译者之间的广泛变化以及疲劳等因素，其影响力十分有限。深度学习在其他现实应用中取得成功之后，也为医学影像提供了精确的解决方案，被认为是未来健康照护应用的关键。在本章中，我们讨论了用于医学图像分割和分类的最先进的深度学习架构及其优化。在最后一节中，我们讨论了基于深度学习的医学成像方法和开放研究课题面临的挑战。
