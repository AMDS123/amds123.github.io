##### Abstract
Mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) is a growing public health problem with an estimated incidence of one million people annually in US. Neurocognitive tests are used to both assess the patient condition and to monitor the patient progress. This work aims to directly use MR images taken shortly after injury to detect whether a patient suffers from mTBI, by incorporating machine learning and computer vision techniques to learn features suitable discriminating between mTBI and normal patients. We focus on 3 regions in brain, and extract multiple patches from them, and use bag-of-visual-word technique to represent each subject as a histogram of representative patterns derived from patches from all training subjects. After extracting the features, we use greedy forward feature selection, to choose a subset of features which achieves highest accuracy. We show through experimental studies that BoW features perform better than the simple mean value features which were used previously.

轻度创伤性脑损伤（mTBI）是一个日益严重的公共卫生问题，估计美国每年有100万人发病。神经认知测试用于评估患者状况并监测患者进展。这项工作旨在直接使用损伤后不久拍摄的MR图像，通过结合机器学习和计算机视觉技术来学习患者是否患有mTBI，以学习适合区分mTBI和正常患者的特征。我们将注意力集中在脑部的3个区域，并从中提取多个斑块，并使用视觉词袋技术将每个对象表示为来自所有训练对象斑块的代表性模式的直方图。在提取特征之后，我们使用贪婪前向特征选择来选择实现最高精度的特征子集。我们通过实验研究表明BoW特征比之前使用的简单均值特征更好地表现。
