##### Abstract
A convolution neural network (CNN) based classification method for broadband DOA estimation is proposed, where the phase component of the short-time Fourier transform coefficients of the received microphone signals are directly fed into the CNN and the features required for DOA estimation are learnt during training. Since only the phase component of the input is used, the CNN can be trained with synthesized noise signals, thereby making the preparation of the training data set easier compared to using speech signals. Through experimental evaluation, the ability of the proposed noise trained CNN framework to generalize to speech sources is demonstrated. In addition, the robustness of the system to noise, small perturbations in microphone positions, as well as its ability to adapt to different acoustic conditions is investigated using experiments with simulated and real data.

提出一种基于卷积神经网络（CNN）的宽带DOA估计分类方法，将接收到的麦克风信号的短时傅里叶变换系数的相位分量直接馈入CNN，并在此期间学习DOA估计所需的特征训练。由于只使用输入的相位分量，所以可以用合成的噪声信号训练CNN，从而使得训练数据组的准备比使用语音信号更容易。通过实验评估，证明了所提出的噪声训练CNN框架推广到语音源的能力。此外，通过模拟和真实数据的实验，研究了系统对噪声的鲁棒性，麦克风位置的微小扰动，以及适应不同声学条件的能力。
