##### Abstract
As the issue of freshwater shortage is increasing daily, it is critical to take effective measures for water conservation. According to previous studies, device level consumption could lead to significant freshwater conservation. Existing water disaggregation methods focus on learning the signatures for appliances; however, they are lack of the mechanism to accurately discriminate parallel appliances' consumption. In this paper, we propose a Bayesian Discriminative Sparse Coding model using Laplace Prior (BDSC-LP) to extensively enhance the disaggregation performance. To derive discriminative basis functions, shape features are presented to describe the low-sampling-rate water consumption patterns. A Gibbs sampling based inference method is designed to extend the discriminative capability of the disaggregation dictionaries. Extensive experiments were performed to validate the effectiveness of the proposed model using both real-world and synthetic datasets.

由于淡水短缺日益增加，采取有效的节水措施至关重要。根据以前的研究，设备水平消耗可能导致显着的淡水保护。现有的水分解方法着重于学习器具的签名;然而，他们缺乏准确区分并联电器消费的机制。在本文中，我们提出了一种使用拉普拉斯先验（BDSC-LP）的贝叶斯判别稀疏编码模型，以广泛地增强解聚性能。为了得出判别基函数，提出了形状特征来描述低采样率的耗水模式。基于吉布斯采样的推理方法旨在扩展分解词典的判别能力。使用真实世界和合成数据集进行了大量实验以验证所提出模型的有效性。
