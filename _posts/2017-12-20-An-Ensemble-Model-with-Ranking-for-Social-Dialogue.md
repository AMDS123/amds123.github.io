##### Abstract
Open-domain social dialogue is one of the long-standing goals of Artificial Intelligence. This year, the Amazon Alexa Prize challenge was announced for the first time, where real customers get to rate systems developed by leading universities worldwide. The aim of the challenge is to converse "coherently and engagingly with humans on popular topics for 20 minutes". We describe our Alexa Prize system (called 'Alana') consisting of an ensemble of bots, combining rule-based and machine learning systems, and using a contextual ranking mechanism to choose a system response. The ranker was trained on real user feedback received during the competition, where we address the problem of how to train on the noisy and sparse feedback obtained during the competition.

开放领域的社会对话是人工智能的长期目标之一。今年，亚马逊Alexa的挑战是第一次宣布，真正的客户得到世界领先的大学开发的系统。挑战的目的是在20分钟内“与人类进行连贯而有趣的交流”。我们描述了由机器人集合组成的Alexa Prize系统（称为“Alana”），结合了基于规则和机器学习系统，并使用上下文排序机制来选择系统响应。排行榜是在比赛期间接收到真实用户反馈的训练，我们解决了如何训练比赛中获得的嘈杂和稀疏反馈的问题。
