##### Abstract
Convolutional neural networks have been applied to a wide variety of computer vision tasks. Recent advances in semantic segmentation have enabled their application to medical image segmentation. While most CNNs use two-dimensional kernels, recent CNN-based publications on medical image segmentation featured three-dimensional kernels, allowing full access to the three-dimensional structure of medical images. Though closely related to semantic segmentation, medical image segmentation includes specific challenges that need to be addressed, such as the scarcity of labelled data, the high class imbalance found in the ground truth and the high memory demand of three-dimensional images. In this work, a CNN-based method with three-dimensional filters is demonstrated and applied to hand and brain MRI. Two modifications to an existing CNN architecture are discussed, along with methods on addressing the aforementioned challenges. While most of the existing literature on medical image segmentation focuses on soft tissue and the major organs, this work is validated on data both from the central nervous system as well as the bones of the hand.

##### Abstract (translated by Google)
卷积神经网络已被应用于各种计算机视觉任务。语义分割方面的最新进展使其能够应用于医学图像分割。虽然大多数CNN使用二维内核，但近期基于CNN的医学图像分割出版物具有三维内核，可以充分利用医学图像的三维结构。医学图像分割虽然与语义分割密切相关，但其中包括标注数据的稀缺性，基础事实中存在的高级别不平衡性和三维图像的高存储需求等特殊挑战。在这项工作中，基于CNN的三维滤波器的方法被证明，并应用于手和脑MRI。讨论了对现有CNN体系结构的两种修改，以及解决上述挑战的方法。虽然现有的大部分关于医学图像分割的文献主要集中在软组织和主要器官，但这项工作是从中枢神经系统和手部骨骼两方面进行验证的。
