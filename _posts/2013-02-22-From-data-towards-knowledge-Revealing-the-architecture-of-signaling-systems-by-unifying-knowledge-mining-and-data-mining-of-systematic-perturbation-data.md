##### Abstract
Genetic and pharmacological perturbation experiments, such as deleting a gene and monitoring gene expression responses, are powerful tools for studying cellular signal transduction pathways. However, it remains a challenge to automatically derive knowledge of a cellular signaling system at a conceptual level from systematic perturbation-response data. In this study, we explored a framework that unifies knowledge mining and data mining approaches towards the goal. The framework consists of the following automated processes: 1) applying an ontology-driven knowledge mining approach to identify functional modules among the genes responding to a perturbation in order to reveal potential signals affected by the perturbation; 2) applying a graph-based data mining approach to search for perturbations that affect a common signal with respect to a functional module, and 3) revealing the architecture of a signaling system organize signaling units into a hierarchy based on their relationships. Applying this framework to a compendium of yeast perturbation-response data, we have successfully recovered many well-known signal transduction pathways; in addition, our analysis have led to many hypotheses regarding the yeast signal transduction system; finally, our analysis automatically organized perturbed genes as a graph reflecting the architect of the yeast signaling system. Importantly, this framework transformed molecular findings from a gene level to a conceptual level, which readily can be translated into computable knowledge in the form of rules regarding the yeast signaling system, such as "if genes involved in MAPK signaling are perturbed, genes involved in pheromone responses will be differentially expressed".
