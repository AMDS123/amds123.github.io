##### Abstract
Formal Semantics and Distributional Semantics are two important semantic frameworks in Natural Language Processing (NLP). Cognitive Semantics belongs to the movement of Cognitive Linguistics, which is based on contemporary cognitive science. Each framework could deal with some meaning phenomena, but none of them fulfills all requirements proposed by applications. A unified semantic theory characterizing all important language phenomena has both theoretical and practical significance; however, although many attempts have been made in recent years, no existing theory has achieved this goal yet. This article introduces a new semantic theory that has the potential to characterize most of the important meaning phenomena of natural language and to fulfill most of the necessary requirements for philosophical analysis and for NLP applications. The theory is based on a unified representation of information, and constructs a kind of mathematical model called cognitive model to interpret natural language expressions in a compositional manner. It accepts the empirical assumption of Cognitive Semantics, and overcomes most shortcomings of Formal Semantics and of Distributional Semantics. The theory, however, is not a simple combination of existing theories, but an extensive generalization of classic logic and Formal Semantics. It inherits nearly all advantages of Formal Semantics, and also provides descriptive contents for objects and events as fine-gram as possible, descriptive contents which represent the results of human cognition.

形式语义和分布语义是自然语言处理（NLP）中两个重要的语义框架。认知语义学属于认知语言学的运动，认知语言学是以当代认知科学为基础的。每个框架可以处理一些意义现象，但是它们都不能满足应用程序提出的所有要求。表征所有重要语言现象的统一语义理论既具有理论意义，又具有实践意义。然而，近年来虽然做了很多尝试，但是现在还没有一个理论能够实现这个目标。本文介绍了一种新的语义理论，它有可能表征大多数自然语言的重要意义现象，并满足哲学分析和NLP应用的大部分必要要求。该理论基于信息的统一表征，构建了一种称为认知模型的数学模型，以组合方式解释自然语言表达。它接受了认知语义学的经验假设，克服了形式语义学和分布语义学的缺点。然而，这个理论并不是现有理论的简单组合，而是经典逻辑和形式语义学的广泛推广。它继承了形式语义学几乎所有的优点，也为对象和事件提供了描述性的内容，尽可能细致地描述了人类认知结果的描述性内容。
