##### Abstract
Head CT is one of the most commonly performed imaging studied in the Emergency Department setting and Intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) is among the most critical and timesensitive findings to be detected on Head CT. We present BloodNet, a deep learning architecture designed for optimal triaging of Head CTs, with the goal of decreasing the time from CT acquisition to accurate ICH detection. The BloodNet architecture incorporates dependency between the otherwise independent tasks of segmentation and classification, achieving improved classification results. AUCs of 0.9493 and 0.9566 are reported on held out positive-enriched and randomly sampled sets comprised of over 1400 studies acquired from over 10 different hospitals. These results are comparable to previously reported results with smaller number of tagged studies.
