##### Abstract
Face detection has witnessed immense progress in the last few years, with new milestones being surpassed every year. While many challenges such as large variations in scale, pose, appearance are successfully addressed, there still exist several issues which are not specifically captured by existing methods or datasets. In this work, we identify the next set of challenges that requires attention from the research community and collect a new dataset of face images that involve these issues such as weather-based degradations, motion blur, focus blur and several others. We demonstrate that there is a considerable gap in the performance of state-of-the-art detectors and real-world requirements. Hence, in an attempt to fuel further research in unconstrained face detection, we present a new annotated Unconstrained Face Detection Dataset (UFDD) with several challenges and benchmark recent methods. Additionally, we provide an in-depth analysis of the results and failure cases of these methods. The dataset as well as baseline results will be made publicly available in due time.

##### Abstract (translated by Google)
人脸识别在过去几年中取得了巨大的进步，每年都有新的里程碑被超越。虽然诸如规模，姿势，外观上的巨大变化等许多挑战已被成功解决，但仍存在若干问题，这些问题未被现有方法或数据集专门捕获。在这项工作中，我们确定了需要研究界关注的下一组挑战，并收集涉及这些问题的新图像数据集，例如基于天气的降级，运动模糊，焦点模糊等等。我们证明，在最先进的探测器和真实世界需求的性能方面存在相当大的差距。因此，为了进一步加强对无约束人脸检测的研究，我们提出了一种新的带注释的无约束人脸检测数据集（UFDD），其中有几个挑战和基准最近的方法。此外，我们对这些方法的结果和失败案例进行了深入分析。数据集以及基线结果将在适当的时候公布。
