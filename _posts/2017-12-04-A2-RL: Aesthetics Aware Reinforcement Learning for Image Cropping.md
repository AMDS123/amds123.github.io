##### Abstract
Image cropping aims at improving the aesthetic quality of images by adjusting their composition. Most previous methods rely on the sliding window mechanism. The sliding window mechanism requires fixed aspect ratios and limits the cropping region with arbitrary size. Moreover, the sliding window method usually produces tens of thousands of windows which is very time-consuming. Motivated by these challenges, we firstly formulate the aesthetic image cropping as a sequential decision-making process and propose an Aesthetics Aware Reinforcement Learning (A2-RL) framework to address this problem. Particularly, the proposed method develops an aesthetics aware reward function which especially benefits image cropping. Similar to human's decision making, we use a comprehensive state representation including both the current observation and the historical experience. We train the agent using the actor-critic architecture in an end-to-end manner. The agent is evaluated on several popular unseen cropping datasets. Experiment results show that our method achieves the state-of-the-art performance with much fewer candidate windows and much less time compared with previous methods.

图像裁剪旨在通过调整图像的组成来改善图像的美感质量。大多数以前的方法依赖于滑动窗口机制。滑动窗口机制需要固定的高宽比，并将裁剪区域限制为任意大小。而且，滑动窗口方法通常产生数万个窗口，这非常耗时。受这些挑战的驱动，我们首先将审美意象裁剪作为一个连续的决策过程，并提出一个美学意识强化学习（A2-RL）框架来解决这个问题。特别是，所提出的方法开发了美学意识的奖励功能，特别有利于图像裁剪。与人类决策类似，我们使用包括当前观察和历史经验的全面状态表示。我们以端到端的方式使用actor-critic架构来训练代理。该代理在几个流行的不可见的裁剪数据集上进行评估。实验结果表明，与先前的方法相比，我们的方法实现了最先进的性能，候选窗口少得多，时间也少得多。
