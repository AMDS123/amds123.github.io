##### Abstract
In the modern era, abundant information is easily accessible from various sources, however only a few of these sources are reliable as they mostly contain unverified contents. We develop a system to validate the truthfulness of a given statement together with underlying evidence. The proposed system provides supporting evidence when the statement is tagged as false. Our work relies on an inference method on a knowledge graph (KG) to identify the truthfulness of statements. In order to extract the evidence of falseness, the proposed algorithm takes into account combined knowledge from KG and ontologies. The system shows very good results as it provides valid and concise evidence. The quality of KG plays a role in the performance of the inference method which explicitly affects the performance of our evidence-extracting algorithm.

##### Abstract (translated by Google)
在现代时代，丰富的信息很容易从各种渠道获取，然而只有少数这些信息来源是可靠的，因为它们大多含有未经验证的内容。我们开发了一个系统来验证给定陈述的真实性以及潜在的证据。当声明被标记为错误时，拟议系统提供支持性证据。我们的工作依赖于知识图表（KG）的推理方法来识别陈述的真实性。为了提取虚假证据，该算法考虑了KG和本体的组合知识。该系统提供了非常好的结果，因为它提供了有效和简明的证据。 KG的质量在推理方法的性能中扮演着重要角色，这明确影响了我们证据提取算法的性能。
