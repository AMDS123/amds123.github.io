##### Abstract
Elections unleash strong political views on Twitter, but what do people really think about politics? Opinion and trend mining on micro blogs dealing with politics has recently attracted researchers in several fields including Information Retrieval and Machine Learning (ML). Since the performance of ML and Natural Language Processing (NLP) approaches are limited by the amount and quality of data available, one promising alternative for some tasks is the automatic propagation of expert annotations. This paper intends to develop a so-called active learning process for automatically annotating French language tweets that deal with the image (i.e., representation, web reputation) of politicians. Our main focus is on the methodology followed to build an original annotated dataset expressing opinion from two French politicians over time. We therefore review state of the art NLP-based ML algorithms to automatically annotate tweets using a manual initiation step as bootstrap. This paper focuses on key issues about active learning while building a large annotated data set from noise. This will be introduced by human annotators, abundance of data and the label distribution across data and entities. In turn, we show that Twitter characteristics such as the author's name or hashtags can be considered as the bearing point to not only improve automatic systems for Opinion Mining (OM) and Topic Classification but also to reduce noise in human annotations. However, a later thorough analysis shows that reducing noise might induce the loss of crucial information.

选举在Twitter上引发强烈的政治观点，但人们对政治有什么看法？微博上关于政治的意见和趋势挖掘最近吸引了包括信息检索和机器学习（ML）在内的多个领域的研究人员。由于ML和自然语言处理（NLP）方法的性能受限于可用数据的数量和质量，所以对于某些任务来说，一种有希望的替代方案是自动传播专家注释。本文旨在开发一种所谓的主动学习过程，用于自动注释处理政客的形象（即表现，网络声誉）的法语推文。我们主要关注的是采用的方法是建立一个原始的注释数据集，表达两位法国政治家的意见。因此，我们审查了最先进的基于NLP的ML算法，以自动注释使用手动启动步骤作为引导的推文。本文侧重于主动学习的关键问题，同时建立一个大型的噪声注释数据集。这将由人类注释员，数据丰富和数据和实体之间的标签分布引入。反过来，我们表明，作者的名字或主题标签等Twitter特征可以被认为是不仅改进了意见挖掘（OM）和主题分类的自动系统，而且减少人类注释中的噪声的方向。不过，稍后的透彻分析表明，降低噪音可能会导致关键信息的丢失。
