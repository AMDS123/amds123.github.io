##### Abstract
A rigorous formulation of the dynamics of a signal processing scheme aimed at dense signal scanning without any loss in accuracy is introduced and analyzed. Related methods proposed in the recent past lack a satisfactory analysis of whether they actually fulfill any exactness constraints. This is improved through an exact characterization of the requirements for a sound sliding window approach. The tools developed in this paper are especially beneficial if Convolutional Neural Networks are employed, but can also be used as a more general framework to validate related approaches to signal scanning. The proposed theory helps to eliminate redundant computations and renders special case treatment unnecessary, resulting in a dramatic boost in efficiency particularly on massively parallel processors. This is demonstrated both theoretically in a computational complexity analysis and empirically on modern parallel processors.

介绍并分析了一个严格的信号处理方案的动态表达，旨在密集的信号扫描，没有任何的精度损失。最近提出的相关方法缺乏令人满意的分析，究竟它们是否实际上满足任何精确性约束。这是通过对声音滑动窗口方法的要求的精确表征来改进的。如果使用卷积神经网络，本文开发的工具特别有用，但也可以作为更一般的框架来验证相关的信号扫描方法。所提出的理论有助于消除冗余计算，并且不需要特殊情况下的处理，从而导致效率的显着提高，特别是在大规模并行处理器上。这在计算复杂性分析和现代并行处理器的经验上都在理论上得到证明。
