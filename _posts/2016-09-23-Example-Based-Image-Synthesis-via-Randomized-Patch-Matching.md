##### Abstract
Image and texture synthesis is a challenging task that has long been drawing attention in the fields of image processing, graphics, and machine learning. This problem consists of modelling the desired type of images, either through training examples or via a parametric modeling, and then generating images that belong to the same statistical origin. This work addresses the image synthesis task, focusing on two specific families of images -- handwritten digits and face images. This paper offers two main contributions. First, we suggest a simple and intuitive algorithm capable of generating such images in a unified way. The proposed approach taken is pyramidal, consisting of upscaling and refining the estimated image several times. For each upscaling stage, the algorithm randomly draws small patches from a patch database, and merges these to form a coherent and novel image with high visual quality. The second contribution is a general framework for the evaluation of the generation performance, which combines three aspects: the likelihood, the originality and the spread of the synthesized images. We assess the proposed synthesis scheme and show that the results are similar in nature, and yet different from the ones found in the training set, suggesting that true synthesis effect has been obtained.

图像和纹理合成是一项具有挑战性的任务，在图像处理，图形和机器学习领域一直备受关注。这个问题包括对所需类型的图像进行建模，通过训练样例或通过参数化建模，然后生成属于相同统计学原点的图像。这项工作解决了图像合成任务，侧重于两个特定的图像家族 - 手写数字和人脸图像。本文提供了两个主要的贡献。首先，我们建议一个简单而直观的算法，能够以统一的方式生成这样的图像。所提出的方法是金字塔形，包括放大和精炼估计的图像几次。对于每个放大的阶段，算法从补丁数据库中随机抽取小块，并将其合并，形成具有高视觉质量的连贯和新颖的图像。第二个贡献是对发电性能评估的总体框架，其结合了三个方面：合成图像的可能性，原创性和传播性。我们评估提出的综合方案，并表明，结果是性质相似，但不同于在训练集中发现，表明真正的合成效果已经获得。
