##### Abstract
Human interaction involves very sophisticated non-verbal communication skills like understanding the goals and actions of others and coordinating our own actions accordingly. Neuroscience refers to this mechanism as motor resonance, in the sense that the perception of another person's actions and sensory experiences activates the observer's brain as if (s)he would be performing the same actions and having the same experiences. We analyze and model non-verbal cues (arm movements) exchanged between two humans that interact and execute handover actions. The contributions of this paper are the following: (i) computational models, using recorded motion data, describing the motor behaviour of each actor in action-in-interaction situations, (ii) a computational model that captures the behaviour if the "giver" and "receiver" during an object handover action, by coupling the arm motion of both actors, and (iii) embedded these models in the iCub robot for both action execution and recognition. Our results show that: (i) the robot can interpret the human arm motion and recognize handover actions; and (ii) behave in a "human-like" manner to receive the object of the recognized handover action.
