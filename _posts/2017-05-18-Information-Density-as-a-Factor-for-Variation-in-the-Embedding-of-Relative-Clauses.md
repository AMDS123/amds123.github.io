##### Abstract
In German, relative clauses can be positioned in-situ or extraposed. A potential factor for the variation might be information density. In this study, this hypothesis is tested with a corpus of 17th century German funeral sermons. For each referent in the relative clauses and their matrix clauses, the attention state was determined (first calculation). In a second calculation, for each word the surprisal values were determined, using a bi-gram language model. In a third calculation, the surprisal values were accommodated as to whether it is the first occurrence of the word in question or not. All three calculations pointed in the same direction: With in-situ relative clauses, the rate of new referents was lower and the average surprisal values were lower, especially the accommodated surprisal values, than with extraposed relative clauses. This indicated that in-formation density is a factor governing the choice between in-situ and extraposed relative clauses. The study also sheds light on the intrinsic relation-ship between the information theoretic concept of information density and in-formation structural concepts such as givenness which are used under a more linguistic perspective.

在德语中，相关条款可以原位或外置。这种变化的潜在因素可能是信息密度。在这项研究中，这个假设是用17世纪的德国葬礼布道的语料进行的。对于关系从句及其基础句中的每个对象，确定注意状态（首先计算）。在第二个计算中，使用二元语言模型为每个单词确定惊人的值。在第三个计算中，这个惊人的数值是否适合于这个词是否是第一次出现。这三个计算都指向同一方向：就地关系从句而言，新的指称的比率较低，平均意外值较低，特别是容纳的惊人价值，而不是相关的附加条款。这表明，信息密度是决定现场和附加关系条款之间选择的一个因素。本研究还揭示了信息密度的信息理论概念与更多语言学视角下的信息结构概念（如给定）之间的内在联系。
