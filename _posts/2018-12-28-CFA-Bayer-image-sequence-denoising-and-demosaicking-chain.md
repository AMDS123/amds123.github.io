##### Abstract
The demosaicking provokes the spatial and color correlation of noise, which is afterwards enhanced by the imaging pipeline. The correct removal previous or simultaneously with the demosaicking process is not usually considered in the literature. We present a novel imaging chain including a denoising of the Bayer CFA and a demosaicking method for image sequences. The proposed algorithm uses a spatio-temporal patch method for the noise removal and demosaicking of the CFA. The experimentation, including real examples, illustrates the superior performance of the proposed chain, avoiding the creation of artifacts and colored spots in the final image.
