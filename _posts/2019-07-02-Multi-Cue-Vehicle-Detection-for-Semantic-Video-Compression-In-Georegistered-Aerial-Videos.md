##### Abstract
Detection of moving objects such as vehicles in videos acquired from an airborne camera is very useful for video analytics applications. Using fast low power algorithms for onboard moving object detection would also provide region of interest-based semantic information for scene content aware image compression. This would enable more efficient and flexible communication link utilization in lowbandwidth airborne cloud computing networks. Despite recent advances in both UAV or drone platforms and imaging sensor technologies, vehicle detection from aerial video remains challenging due to small object sizes, platform motion and camera jitter, obscurations, scene complexity and degraded imaging conditions. This paper proposes an efficient moving vehicle detection pipeline which synergistically fuses both appearance and motion-based detections in a complementary manner using deep learning combined with flux tensor spatio-temporal filtering. Our proposed multi-cue pipeline is able to detect moving vehicles with high precision and recall, while filtering out false positives such as parked vehicles, through intelligent fusion. Experimental results show that incorporating contextual information of moving vehicles enables high semantic compression ratios of over 100:1 with high image fidelity, for better utilization of limited bandwidth air-to-ground network links.
