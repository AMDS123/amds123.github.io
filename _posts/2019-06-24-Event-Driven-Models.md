##### Abstract
In Reinforcement Learning we look for meaning in the flow of input/output information. If we do not find meaning, the information flow is not more than noise to us. Before we are able to find meaning, we should first learn how to discover and identify objects. What is an object? In this article we will demonstrate that an object is an event-driven model. These models are a generalization of action-driven models. In Markov Decision Process we have an action-driven model which changes its state at each step. The advantage of event-driven models is their greater sustainability as they change their states only upon the occurrence of particular events. These events may occur very rarely, therefore the state of the event-driven model is much more predictable.
