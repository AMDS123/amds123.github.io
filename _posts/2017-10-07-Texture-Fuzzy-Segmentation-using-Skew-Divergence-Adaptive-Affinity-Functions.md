##### Abstract
Digital image segmentation is the process of assigning distinct labels to different objects in a digital image, and the fuzzy segmentation algorithm has been successfully used in the segmentation of images from a wide variety of sources. However, the traditional fuzzy segmentation algorithm fails to segment objects that are characterized by textures whose patterns cannot be successfully described by simple statistics computed over a very restricted area. In this paper, we propose an extension of the fuzzy segmentation algorithm that uses adaptive textural affinity functions to perform the segmentation of such objects on bidimensional images. The adaptive affinity functions compute their appropriate neighborhood size as they compute the texture descriptors surrounding the seed spels (spatial elements), according to the characteristics of the texture being processed. The algorithm then segments the image with an appropriate neighborhood for each object. We performed experiments on mosaic images that were composed using images from the Brodatz database, and compared our results with the ones produced by a recently published texture segmentation algorithm, showing the applicability of our method.

数字图像分割是将不同标签分配给数字图像中的不同对象的过程，并且模糊分割算法已经成功地用于来自各种来源的图像的分割。然而，传统的模糊分割算法未能通过在非常有限的区域上计算简单的统计信息来分割由其纹理不能被成功描述的纹理表征的对象。在本文中，我们提出了一个扩展的模糊分割算法，使用自适应纹理亲和函数来执行这些对象在二维图像上的分割。自适应亲和函数根据正在处理的纹理的特征，在计算种子拼写（空间元素）周围的纹理描述符时计算其适当的邻域大小。该算法然后将图像分割为每个对象的适当邻域。我们使用Brodatz数据库中的图像对马赛克图像进行了实验，并将我们的结果与最近发布的纹理分割算法的结果进行了比较，显示了我们方法的适用性。
