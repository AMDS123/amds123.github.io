##### Abstract
Mount Tai has abundant sunshine, abundant rainfall and favorable climatic conditions, forming dense vegetation with various kinds of trees. In order to make it easier for tourists to understand each tree and experience the culture of Mount Tai, this paper develops an App for tree recognition of Mount Tai based on convolution neural network (CNN), taking advantage of CNN efficient image recognition ability and easy-to-carry characteristics of Android mobile phone. The APP can accurately identify several common trees in Mount Tai, and give a brief introduction for tourists.
