##### Abstract
This paper accompanies the release of Opusparcus, a new paraphrase corpus for six European languages: German, English, Finnish, French, Russian, and Swedish. The corpus consists of paraphrases, that is, pairs of sentences in the same language that mean approximately the same thing. The paraphrases are extracted from the OpenSubtitles2016 corpus, which contains subtitles from movies and TV shows. The informal and colloquial genre that occurs in subtitles makes such data a very interesting language resource, for instance, from the perspective of computer assisted language learning. For each target language, the Opusparcus data have been partitioned into three types of data sets: training, development and test sets. The training sets are large, consisting of millions of sentence pairs, and have been compiled automatically, with the help of probabilistic ranking functions. The development and test sets consist of sentence pairs that have been checked manually; each set contains approximately 1000 sentence pairs that have been verified to be acceptable paraphrases by two annotators.

本文伴随着Opusparcus的发布，Opusparcus是六种欧洲语言的新释义语料库：德语，英语，芬兰语，法语，俄语和瑞典语。语料库由释义组成，即用同一种语言表示大致相同的句子的句子对。这些释义是从OpenSubtitles2016语料库中提取的，其中包含来自电影和电视节目的字幕。字幕中出现的非正式和口语类型使得这些数据成为非常有趣的语言资源，例如，从计算机辅助语言学习的角度来看。对于每种目标语言，Opusparcus数据已被划分为三种类型的数据集：培训，开发和测试集。训练集很大，由数百万个句子对组成，并且在概率排序函数的帮助下自动编译。开发和测试集包括已手动检查的句子对;每组包含大约1000个句子对，这两个句子对被两个注释者验证为可接受的释义。
