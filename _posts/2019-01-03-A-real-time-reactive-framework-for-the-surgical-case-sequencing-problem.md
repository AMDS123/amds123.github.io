##### Abstract
In this paper, the multiple operating room (OR) surgical case sequencing problem (SCSP) is addressed. The objective is to maximise total OR utilisation during standard opening hours. A case study of a large Australian public hospital with long surgical waiting lists and high levels of non-elective demand informs this work. Due to the complexity of the SCSP and the size of the instances considered herein, heuristic techniques are required to solve the problem. We present constructive heuristics based on both a modified block scheduling policy and an open scheduling policy. A number of real-time reactive strategies are presented that can be used to maintain schedule feasibility in the case of disruptions. Results of computational experiments show that this approach maintains schedule feasibility in real-time, whilst increasing operating theatre (OT) utilisation and throughput, and reducing the waiting time of non-elective patients. The framework presented here is applicable to the real-life scheduling of OT departments, and we provide recommendations regarding implementation of the approach.
