##### Abstract
Large-scale knowledge bases have currently reached impressive sizes; however, these knowledge bases are still far from complete. In addition, most of the existing methods for knowledge base completion only consider the direct links between entities, ignoring the vital impact of the consistent semantics of relation paths. In this paper, we study the problem of how to better embed entities and relations of knowledge bases into different low-dimensional spaces by taking full advantage of the additional semantics of relation paths, and we propose a compositional learning model of relation path embedding (RPE). Specifically, with the corresponding relation and path projections, RPE can simultaneously embed each entity into two types of latent spaces. It is also proposed that type constraints could be extended from traditional relation-specific constraints to the new proposed path-specific constraints. The results of experiments show that the proposed model achieves significant and consistent improvements compared with the state-of-the-art algorithms.

##### Abstract (translated by Google)
大规模的知识库目前已经达到令人印象深刻的规模但是，这些知识库还远远没有完成。另外，现有的大多数知识库完成方法只考虑了实体之间的直接联系，忽略了关系路径一致性语义的重要影响。本文研究了如何充分利用关系路径的附加语义，将实体和知识库的关系更好地嵌入到不同的低维空间中，提出了关系路径嵌入（RPE）的组合学习模型）。具体而言，通过相应的关系和路径投影，RPE可以同时将每个实体嵌入到两种潜在空间中。还提出类型约束可以从传统的关系特定约束扩展到新提出的特定路径约束。实验结果表明，与最先进的算法相比，所提出的模型取得了显着和一致的改进。
