##### Abstract
Deep learning is increasingly being used in high-stake decision making applications that affect individual lives. However, deep learning models might exhibit algorithmic discrimination behaviors with respect to protected groups, potentially posing negative impacts on individuals and society. Therefore, fairness in deep learning has attracted tremendous attention recently. We provide a comprehensive review covering existing techniques to tackle algorithmic fairness problems from the computational perspective. Specifically, we show that interpretability can serve as a useful ingredient, which could be augmented into the biases detection and mitigation pipelines. We also discuss open research problems and future research directions, aiming to push forward the area of fairness in deep learning and build genuinely fair, accountable, and transparent deep learning systems.
