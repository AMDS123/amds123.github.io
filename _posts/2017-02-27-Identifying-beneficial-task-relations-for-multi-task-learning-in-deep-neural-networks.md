##### Abstract
Multi-task learning (MTL) in deep neural networks for NLP has recently received increasing interest due to some compelling benefits, including its potential to efficiently regularize models and to reduce the need for labeled data. While it has brought significant improvements in a number of NLP tasks, mixed results have been reported, and little is known about the conditions under which MTL leads to gains in NLP. This paper sheds light on the specific task relations that can lead to gains from MTL models over single-task setups.

##### Abstract (translated by Google)
深度神经网络中用于自然语言处理的多任务学习（MTL）最近因为一些引人注目的好处而受到越来越多的关注，其中包括有效地规范模型和减少标注数据需求的潜力。尽管它在一些NLP任务中带来了显着的改进，但是已经有不同的结果，但是对MTL导致NLP增长的条件知之甚少。本文阐述了可以导致MTL模型在单任务设置上获益的具体任务关系。
