##### Abstract
A sample-relaxed two-dimensional color principal component analysis (SR-2DCPCA) approach is presented for face recognition and image reconstruction based on quaternion models. A relaxation vector is automatically generated according to the variances of training color face images with the same label. A sample-relaxed, low-dimensional covariance matrix is constructed based on all the training samples relaxed by a relaxation vector, and its eigenvectors corresponding to the $r$ largest eigenvalues are defined as the optimal projection. The SR-2DCPCA aims to enlarge the global variance rather than to maximize the variance of the projected training samples. The numerical results based on real face data sets validate that SR-2DCPCA has a higher recognition rate than state-of-the-art methods and is efficient in image reconstruction.

提出了基于四元数模型的人脸识别和图像重构的样本松弛二维彩色主成分分析（SR-2DCPCA）方法。根据具有相同标签的训练彩色人脸图像的方差自动生成松弛矢量。基于松弛向量松弛的所有训练样本构造一个样本松弛的低维协方差矩阵，并且其对应于$ r $最大特征值的特征向量被定义为最优投影。 SR-2DCPCA旨在扩大全局变化而不是最大化投影训练样本的方差。基于真实人脸数据集的数值结果证明，SR-2DCPCA具有比最先进的方法更高的识别率，并且在图像重建中是高效的。
