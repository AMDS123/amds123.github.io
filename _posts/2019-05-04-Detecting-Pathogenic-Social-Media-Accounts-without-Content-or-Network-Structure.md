##### Abstract
The spread of harmful mis-information in social media is a pressing problem. We refer accounts that have the capability of spreading such information to viral proportions as "Pathogenic Social Media" accounts. These accounts include terrorist supporters accounts, water armies, and fake news writers. We introduce an unsupervised causality-based framework that also leverages label propagation. This approach identifies these users without using network structure, cascade path information, content and user's information. We show our approach obtains higher precision (0.75) in identifying Pathogenic Social Media accounts in comparison with random (precision of 0.11) and existing bot detection (precision of 0.16) methods.
