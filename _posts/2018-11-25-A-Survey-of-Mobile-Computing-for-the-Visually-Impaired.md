##### Abstract
The number of visually impaired or blind (VIB) people in the world is estimated at several hundred million. Based on a series of interviews with the VIB and developers of assistive technology, this paper provides a survey of machine-learning based mobile applications and identifies the most relevant applications. We discuss the functionality of these apps, how they align with the needs and requirements of the VIB users, and how they can be improved with techniques such as federated learning and model compression. As a result of this study we identify promising future directions of research in mobile perception, micro-navigation, and content-summarization.
