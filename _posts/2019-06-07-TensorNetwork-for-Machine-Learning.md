##### Abstract
We demonstrate the use of tensor networks for image classification with the TensorNetwork open source library. We explain in detail the encoding of image data into a matrix product state form, and describe how to contract the network in a way that is parallelizable and well-suited to automatic gradients for optimization. Applying the technique to the MNIST and Fashion-MNIST datasets we find out-of-the-box performance of 98% and 88% accuracy, respectively, using the same tensor network architecture. The TensorNetwork library allows us to seamlessly move from CPU to GPU hardware, and we see a factor of more than 10 improvement in computational speed using a GPU.
