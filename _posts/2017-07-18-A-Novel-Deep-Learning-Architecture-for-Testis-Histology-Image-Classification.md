##### Abstract
Unlike other histology analysis, classification of tubule status in testis histology is very challenging due to their high similarity of texture and shape. Traditional deep learning networks have difficulties to capture nuance details among different tubule categories. In this paper, we propose a novel deep learning architecture for feature learning, image classification, and image reconstruction. It is based on stacked auto-encoders with an additional layer, called a hyperlayer, which is created to capture features of an image at different layers in the network. This addition effectively combines features at different scales and thus provides a more complete profile for further classification. Evaluation is performed on a set of 10,542 tubule image patches. We demonstrate our approach with two experiments on two different subsets of the dataset. The results show that the features learned from our architecture achieve more than 98% accuracy and represent an improvement over traditional deep network architectures.

与其他组织学分析不同的是，睾丸组织学中的肾小管状态分类是非常具有挑战性的，因为它们的纹理和形状高度相似。传统的深度学习网络难以捕捉不同细管类别之间的细微差别细节。在本文中，我们提出了一种新的深度学习架构的特征学习，图像分类和图像重建。它基于叠加的自动编码器，并具有一个称为超级层（hyperlayer）的附加层，该层用于捕获网络中不同层的图像特征。这种添加有效地结合了不同规模的功能，从而为进一步分类提供了更完整的配置文件。在一组10,542个小管图像块上进行评估。我们用数据集的两个不同子集上的两个实验来演示我们的方法。结果表明，从我们的架构中学到的特性达到了超过98％的准确度，并且是对传统深层网络架构的改进。
