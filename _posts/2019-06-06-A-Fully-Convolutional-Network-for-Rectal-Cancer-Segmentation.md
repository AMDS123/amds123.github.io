##### Abstract
In preoperative imaging, the demarcation of rectal cancer forms an important basis for various tasks including prediction, staging, and treatment planning. The aim of this study is to develop a fully automatic method to segment rectal cancer with axial T2-weighted magnetic resonance images. In order to improve the performance, the network was supplemented with the rectum segmentation task as well, which is also clinically informative. Moreover, we propose an assessment method based on bias-variance decomposition to visualize and measure the regional model robustness of a segmentation network. In addition, we implement an augmentation method enabled by the fully convolutional nature of the network, showing that it improves segmentation performance and reduces training time. Our proposed method is computationally efficient compared to the previous studies regarding rectal cancer segmentation. It also shows high accuracy in rectum segmentation, for which no previous studies exist. We conclude that rectum information improves the training of the rectal cancer segmentation model, especially model variance.
