##### Abstract
Autonomous inspection of large geographical areas is a central requirement for efficient hazard detection and disaster management in future cyber-physical systems such as smart cities. In this regard, exploiting unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) swarms is a promising solution to inspect vast areas efficiently and with low cost. In fact, UAVs can easily fly and reach inspection points, record surveillance data, and send this information to a wireless base station (BS). Nonetheless, in many cases, such as operations at remote areas, the UAVs cannot be guided directly by the BS in real-time to find their path. Moreover, another key challenge of inspection by UAVs is the limited battery capacity. Thus, realizing the vision of autonomous inspection via UAVs requires energy-efficient path planning that takes into account the energy constraint of each individual UAV. In this paper, a novel path planning algorithm is proposed for performing energy-efficient inspection, under stringent energy availability constraints for each UAV. The developed framework takes into account all aspects of energy consumption for a UAV swarm during the inspection operations, including energy required for flying, hovering, and data transmission. It is shown that the proposed algorithm can address the path planning problem efficiently in polynomial time. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm can yield substantial performance gains in terms of minimizing the overall inspection time and energy. Moreover, the results provide guidelines to determine parameters such as the number of required UAVs and amount of energy, while designing an autonomous inspection system.

大型地理区域的自主检查是未来网络物理系统（如智能城市）中有效的危险检测和灾难管理的核心要求。在这方面，开发无人驾驶飞行器（UAV）群是有效且低成本地检查大面积区域的有前景的解决方案。事实上，无人机可以轻松飞行并到达检查点，记录监视数据，并将此信息发送到无线基站（BS）。尽管如此，在许多情况下，例如在偏远地区的操作，无法由BS直接引导无人机以找到它们的路径。此外，无人机检查的另一个关键挑战是电池容量有限。因此，实现通过UAV进行自主检查的愿景需要能量有效的路径规划，其考虑了每个单独UAV的能量约束。在本文中，提出了一种新的路径规划算法，用于在每个无人机严格的能量可用性约束下进行节能检测。开发的框架在检查操作期间考虑了无人机群的能耗的所有方面，包括飞行，悬停和数据传输所需的能量。结果表明，该算法能够在多项式时间内有效地解决路径规划问题。仿真结果表明，该算法在最小化整体检测时间和能量方面可以产生显着的性能提升。此外，在设计自主检查系统时，结果提供了确定诸如所需无人机数量和能量数量等参数的指南。
