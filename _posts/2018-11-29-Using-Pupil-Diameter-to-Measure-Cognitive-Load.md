##### Abstract
In this paper, we will present a method for measuring cognitive load and online real-time feedback using the Tobii Pro 2 eye-tracking glasses. The system is envisaged to be capable of estimating high cognitive load states and situations, and adjust human-machine interfaces to the user's needs. The system is using well-known metrics such as average pupillary size over time. Our system can provide cognitive load feedback at 17-18 Hz. We will elaborate on our results of a HRI study using this tool to show it's functionality.
