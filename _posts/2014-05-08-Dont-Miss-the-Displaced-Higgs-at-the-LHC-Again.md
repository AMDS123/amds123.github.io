##### Abstract
A signature often found in non-minimal Higgs sectors is Higgs decay to a new gauge-singlet scalar, followed by decays of the singlets into Standard Model fermions through small mixing angles. The scalar decay can naturally be displaced from the primary vertex. The present experimental constraints on such models are extremely weak, due to low (or zero) trigger rates for the resulting low $p_T$ displaced jets. In this letter, we highlight the advantages of integrating into the trigger system massively parallel computing and coprocessors based on Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) or the Many Integrated Core (MIC) architecture. In particular, if such coprocessors are added to the LHC experiments' high level trigger systems, a fast Hough transform based triggers performed on this hardware would result in significant improvement to displaced searches, sufficient to discover long-lived Higgs models with a small amount of luminosity in Run II at the 14 TeV LHC.
