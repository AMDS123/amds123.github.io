##### Abstract
With the fast growth of communication networks, the video data transmission from these networks is extremely vulnerable. Error concealment is a technique to estimate the damaged data by employing the correctly received data at the decoder. In this paper, an efficient boundary matching algorithm for estimating damaged motion vectors (MVs) is proposed. The proposed algorithm performs error concealment for each damaged macro block (MB) according to the list of identified priority of each frame. It then uses a classic boundary matching criterion or the proposed boundary matching criterion adaptively to identify matching distortion in each boundary of candidate MB. Finally, the candidate MV with minimum distortion is selected as an MV of damaged MB and the list of priorities is updated. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm improves both objective and subjective qualities of reconstructed frames without any significant increase in computational cost. The PSNR for test sequences in some frames is increased about 4.7, 4.5, and 4.4 dB compared to the classic boundary matching, directional boundary matching, and directional temporal boundary matching algorithm, respectively.

随着通信网络的快速增长，这些网络的视频数据传输极为脆弱。错误隐藏是通过在解码器处使用正确接收的数据来估计损坏的数据的技术。本文提出了一种有效的估计损伤运动矢量（MV）的边界匹配算法。所提出的算法根据每个帧的识别优先级列表对每个损坏的宏块（MB）进行错误隐藏。然后使用经典边界匹配准则或所提出的边界匹配准则自适应地识别候选MB的每个边界中的匹配失真。最后，选择具有最小失真的候选MV作为受损MB的MV，并且更新优先级列表。实验结果表明，该算法改善了重构帧的客观质量和主观质量，而不会显着增加计算成本。与经典边界匹配，方向边界匹配和方向时间边界匹配算法相比，在一些帧中测试序列的PSNR增加了大约4.7,4.5和4.4dB。
