##### Abstract
Performance appraisal (PA) is an important HR process to periodically measure and evaluate every employee's performance vis-a-vis the goals established by the organization. A PA process involves purposeful multi-step multi-modal communication between employees, their supervisors and their peers, such as self-appraisal, supervisor assessment and peer feedback. Analysis of the structured data and text produced in PA is crucial for measuring the quality of appraisals and tracking actual improvements. In this paper, we apply text mining techniques to produce insights from PA text. First, we perform sentence classification to identify strengths, weaknesses and suggestions of improvements found in the supervisor assessments and then use clustering to discover broad categories among them. Next we use multi-class multi-label classification techniques to match supervisor assessments to predefined broad perspectives on performance. Finally, we propose a short-text summarization technique to produce a summary of peer feedback comments for a given employee and compare it with manual summaries. All techniques are illustrated using a real-life dataset of supervisor assessment and peer feedback text produced during the PA of 4528 employees in a large multi-national IT company.

绩效考核（PA）是定期衡量和评估每个员工绩效的一个重要的人力资源流程，与组织建立的目标相对照。 PA流程涉及员工，主管和同事之间的有目的的多步骤多方式沟通，如自我评估，主管评估和同伴反馈。对PA中产生的结构化数据和文本的分析对于衡量评估质量和跟踪实际改进至关重要。在本文中，我们应用文本挖掘技术从PA文本中产生洞察力。首先，我们进行句子分类，以找出主管评估中发现的优点，弱点和改进建议，然后使用聚类发现其中的大类。接下来，我们使用多类多标签分类技术来将主管评估与预定义的广泛性能视角进行匹配。最后，我们提出了一种短文摘要技术，为给定的员工提供同侪反馈意见摘要，并将其与人工摘要进行比较。所有的技术都是通过在一家大型跨国IT公司的4528名雇员的PA中生成的一个真实的数据集来进行说明的。
