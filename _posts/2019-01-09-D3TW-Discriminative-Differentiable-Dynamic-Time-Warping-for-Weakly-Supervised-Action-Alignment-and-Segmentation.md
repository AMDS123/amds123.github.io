##### Abstract
We address weakly-supervised action alignment and segmentation in videos, where only the order of occurring actions is available during training. We propose Discriminative Differentiable Dynamic Time Warping (D${}^3$TW), which is the first discriminative model for weak ordering supervision. This allows us to bypass the degenerated sequence problem usually encountered in previous work. The key technical challenge for discriminative modeling with weak-supervision is that the loss function of the ordering supervision is usually formulated using dynamic programming and is thus not differentiable. We address this challenge by continuous relaxation of the min-operator in dynamic programming and extend the DTW alignment loss to be differentiable. The proposed D${}^3$TW innovatively solves sequence alignment with discriminative modeling and end-to-end training, which substantially improves the performance in weakly supervised action alignment and segmentation tasks. We show that our model outperforms the current state-of-the-art across three evaluation metrics in two challenging datasets.
