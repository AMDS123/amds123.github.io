##### Abstract
Imitation learning holds the promise to address challenging robotic tasks such as autonomous navigation. It however requires a human supervisor to oversee the training process and send correct control commands to robots without feedback, which is always prone to error and expensive. To minimize human involvement and avoid manual labeling of data in the robotic autonomous navigation with imitation learning, this paper proposes a novel semi-supervised imitation learning solution based on a multi-sensory design. This solution includes a suboptimal sensor policy based on sensor fusion to automatically label states encountered by a robot to avoid human supervision during training. In addition, a recording policy is developed to throttle the adversarial affect of learning too much from the suboptimal sensor policy. This solution allows the robot to learn a navigation policy in a self-supervised manner. With extensive experiments in indoor environments, this solution can achieve near human performance in most of the tasks and even surpasses human performance in case of unexpected events such as hardware failures or human operation errors. To best of our knowledge, this is the first work that synthesizes sensor fusion and imitation learning to enable robotic autonomous navigation in the real world without human supervision.

模仿学习有望解决诸如自主导航等具有挑战性的机器人任务。然而，它需要人工主管来监督训练过程，并向机器人发送正确的控制命令，而这些命令总是容易出错和昂贵。为了最大限度地减少人为干预并避免在模拟学习中对机器人自主导航中的数据进行手动标记，本文提出了一种基于多感官设计的新型半监督模仿学习解决方案。该解决方案包括基于传感器融合的次优传感器策略，以自动标记机器人遇到的状态，以避免在训练期间的人员监督。此外，还制定了一项录音政策，以遏制从次优的传感器政策中学习太多的敌对影响。该解决方案允许机器人以自我监督的方式学习导航策略。通过在室内环境中进行大量实验，该解决方案可以在大多数任务中实现近乎人性化的性能，甚至在出现意外事件（例如硬件故障或人为操作错误）时甚至超越人类表现。据我们所知，这是第一部综合了传感器融合和模仿学习的工作，以便在没有人工监控的情况下在现实世界中实现机器人自主导航。
