##### Abstract
In this paper, we present a new kind of learning implementation to recognize the patterns using the concept of Mirroring Neural Network (MNN) which can extract information from distinct sensory input patterns and perform pattern recognition tasks. It is also capable of being used as an advanced associative memory wherein image data is associated with voice inputs in an unsupervised manner. Since the architecture is hierarchical and modular it has the potential of being used to devise learning engines of ever increasing complexity.
