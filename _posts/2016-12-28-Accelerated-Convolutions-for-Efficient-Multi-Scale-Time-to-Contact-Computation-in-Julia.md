##### Abstract
Convolutions have long been regarded as fundamental to applied mathematics, physics and engineering. Their mathematical elegance allows for common tasks such as numerical differentiation to be computed efficiently on large data sets. Efficient computation of convolutions is critical to artificial intelligence in real-time applications, like machine vision, where convolutions must be continuously and efficiently computed on tens to hundreds of kilobytes per second. In this paper, we explore how convolutions are used in fundamental machine vision applications. We present an accelerated n-dimensional convolution package in the high performance computing language, Julia, and demonstrate its efficacy in solving the time to contact problem for machine vision. Results are measured against synthetically generated videos and quantitatively assessed according to their mean squared error from the ground truth. We achieve over an order of magnitude decrease in compute time and allocated memory for comparable machine vision applications. All code is packaged and integrated into the official Julia Package Manager to be used in various other scenarios.

卷积一直被认为是应用数学，物理学和工程学的基础。他们的数学优雅考虑到了常见的任务，如数值微分在大数据集上的高效计算。卷积的高效计算对于实时应用中的人工智能至关重要，例如机器视觉，其中卷积必须连续且有效地计算在每秒数千千字节。在本文中，我们探讨了如何在基础机器视觉应用中使用卷积。我们在高性能计算语言Julia中提出了一个加速的n维卷积包，并展示了它在解决机器视觉接触问题的时间方面的功效。结果是根据综合生成的视频进行测量的，并根据其真实平均误差进行定量评估。我们在计算时间和可分配的机器视觉应用中实现了一个数量级的减少。所有代码都打包并集成到官方的Julia包管理器中，以用于各种其他场景。
