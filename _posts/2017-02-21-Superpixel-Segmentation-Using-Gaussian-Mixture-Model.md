##### Abstract
Superpixel segmentation algorithms are to partition an image into perceptually coherence atomic regions by assigning every pixel a superpixel label. Those algorithms have been wildly used as a preprocessing step in computer vision works, as they can enormously reduce the number of entries of subsequent algorithms. In this work, we propose an alternative superpixel segmentation method based on Gaussian mixture model (GMM) by assuming that each superpixel corresponds to a Gaussian distribution, and assuming that each pixel is generated by first randomly choosing one distribution from several Gaussian distributions which are defined to be related to that pixel, and then the pixel is drawn from the selected distribution. Based on this assumption, each pixel is supposed to be drawn from a mixture of Gaussian distributions with unknown parameters (GMM). An algorithm based on expectation-maximization method is applied to estimate the unknown parameters. Once the unknown parameters are obtained, the superpixel label of a pixel is determined by a posterior probability. The success of applying GMM to superpixel segmentation depends on the two major differences between the traditional GMM-based clustering and the proposed one: data points in our model may be non-identically distributed, and we present an approach to control the shape of the estimated Gaussian functions by adjusting their covariance matrices. Our method is of linear complexity with respect to the number of pixels. The proposed algorithm is inherently parallel and can get faster speed by adding simple OpenMP directives to our implementation. According to our experiments, our algorithm outperforms the state-of-the-art superpixel algorithms in accuracy and presents a competitive performance in computational efficiency.

超像素分割算法是通过为每个像素分配一个超像素标签来将图像划分为感知相干原子区域。这些算法被广泛用作计算机视觉工作中的预处理步骤，因为它们可以极大地减少后续算法的输入数量。在这项工作中，我们提出了一个基于高斯混合模型（GMM）的替代超像素分割方法，假设每个超像素对应一个高斯分布，并假设每个像素是通过首先随机选择一个分布从几个高斯分布与该像素相关，然后从选择的分布画出像素。基于这个假设，每个像素应该是从具有未知参数（GMM）的高斯分布的混合物中抽取的。应用基于期望最大化方法的算法估计未知参数。一旦获得未知参数，则像素的超像素标签由后验概率确定。将GMM应用于超像素分割的成功与否取决于传统的基于GMM的聚类和提出的两种主要区别：我们模型中的数据点可能是非同分布的，我们提出了一种控制估计形状的方法高斯函数通过调整它们的协方差矩阵来起作用。我们的方法是关于像素数量的线性复杂度。所提出的算法本质上是并行的，并且可以通过在我们的实现中添加简单的OpenMP指令来获得更快的速度。根据我们的实验，我们的算法在精度上优于最先进的超像素算法，并且在计算效率方面呈现出有竞争力的性能。
