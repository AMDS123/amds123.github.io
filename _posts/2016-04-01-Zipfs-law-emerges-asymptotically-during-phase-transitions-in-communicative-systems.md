##### Abstract
Zipf's law predicts a power-law relationship between word rank and frequency in language communication systems, and is widely reported in texts yet remains enigmatic as to its origins. Computer simulations have shown that language communication systems emerge at an abrupt phase transition in the fidelity of mappings between symbols and objects. Since the phase transition approximates the Heaviside or step function, we show that Zipfian scaling emerges asymptotically at high rank based on the Laplace transform. We thereby demonstrate that Zipf's law gradually emerges from the moment of phase transition in communicative systems. We show that this power-law scaling behavior explains the emergence of natural languages at phase transitions. We find that the emergence of Zipf's law during language communication suggests that the use of rare words in a lexicon is critical for the construction of an effective communicative system at the phase transition.

拉夫夫定律在语言交际系统中预言了单词等级和频率之间的幂律关系，并且在文本中被广泛报道，但其起源仍然是神秘的。计算机模拟已经表明，语言通信系统在符号和对象之间的映射的保真度中突然出现相变。由于相变近似Heaviside或阶跃函数，我们证明Zipfian标度在高阶上渐近地出现在拉普拉斯变换的基础上。从而证明Zipf定律从交往制度的阶段性转换时刻逐渐显现出来。我们证明这种幂律缩放行为解释了相变过程中自然语言的出现。我们发现，在语言交际中Zipf定律的出现表明，在词汇中使用稀有词汇对于在阶段转换中建立有效的交际系统是至关重要的。
