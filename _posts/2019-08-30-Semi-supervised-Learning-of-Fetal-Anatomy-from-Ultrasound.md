##### Abstract
Semi-supervised learning methods have achieved excellent performance on standard benchmark datasets using very few labelled images. Anatomy classification in fetal 2D ultrasound is an ideal problem setting to test whether these results translate to non-ideal data. Our results indicate that inclusion of a challenging background class can be detrimental and that semi-supervised learning mostly benefits classes that are already distinct, sometimes at the expense of more similar classes.
