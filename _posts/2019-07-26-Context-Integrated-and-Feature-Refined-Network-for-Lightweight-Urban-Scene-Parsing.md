##### Abstract
Semantic segmentation for lightweight urban scene parsing is a very challenging task, because both accuracy and efficiency (e.g., execution speed, memory footprint, and computation complexity) should all be taken into account. However, most previous works pay too much attention to one-sided perspective, either accuracy or speed, and ignore others, which poses a great limitation to actual demands of intelligent devices. To tackle this dilemma, we propose a new lightweight architecture named Context-Integrated and Feature-Refined Network (CIFReNet). The core components of our architecture are the Long-skip Refinement Module (LRM) and the Multi-scale Contexts Integration Module (MCIM). With low additional computation cost, LRM is designed to ease the propagation of spatial information and boost the quality of feature refinement. Meanwhile, MCIM consists of three cascaded Dense Semantic Pyramid (DSP) blocks with a global constraint. It makes full use of sub-regions close to the target and enlarges the field of view in an economical yet powerful way. Comprehensive experiments have demonstrated that our proposed method reaches a reasonable trade-off among overall properties on Cityscapes and Camvid dataset. Specifically, with only 7.1 GFLOPs, CIFReNet that contains less than 1.9 M parameters obtains a competitive result of 70.9% MIoU on Cityscapes test set and 64.5% on Camvid test set at a real-time speed of 32.3 FPS, which is more cost-efficient than other state-of-the-art methods.
