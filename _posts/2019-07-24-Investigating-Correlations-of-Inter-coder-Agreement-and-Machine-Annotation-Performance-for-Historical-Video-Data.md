##### Abstract
Video indexing approaches such as visual concept classification and person recognition are essential to enable fine-grained semantic search in large-scale video archives such as the historical video collection of former German Democratic Republic (GDR) maintained by the German Broadcasting Archive (DRA). Typically, a lexicon of visual concepts has to be defined for semantic search. However, the definition of visual concepts can be more or less subjective due to individually differing judgments of annotators, which may have an impact on annotation quality and subsequently training of supervised machine learning methods. In this paper, we analyze the inter-coder agreement for historical TV data of the former GDR for visual concept classification and person recognition. The inter-coder agreement is evaluated for a group of expert as well as non-expert annotators in order to determine differences in annotation homogeneity. Furthermore, correlations between visual recognition performance and inter-annotator agreement are measured. In this context, information about image quantity and agreement are used to predict average precision for concept classification. Finally, the influence of expert vs. non-expert annotations acquired in the study are used to evaluate person recognition.
