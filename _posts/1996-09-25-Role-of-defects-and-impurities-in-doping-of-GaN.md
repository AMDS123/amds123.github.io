##### Abstract
We have calculated formation energies and position of the defect levels for all native defects and for a variety of donor and acceptor impurities employing first-principles total-energy calculations. An analysis of the numerical results gives direct insight into defect concentrations and impurity solubility with respect to growth parameters (temperature, chemical potentials) and into the mechanisms limiting the doping levels in GaN. We show how compensation and passivation by native defects or impurities, solubility issues, and incorporation of dopants on other sites influence the acceptor doping levels.
