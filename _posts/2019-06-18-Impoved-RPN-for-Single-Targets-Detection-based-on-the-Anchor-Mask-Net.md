##### Abstract
Common target detection is usually based on single frame images, which is vulnerable to affected by the similar targets in the image and not applicable to video images. In this paper , anchor mask is proposed to add the prior knowledge for target detection and an anchor mask net is designed to impove the RPN performance for single target detection. Tested in the VOT2016, the model perform better.
