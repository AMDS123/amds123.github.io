##### Abstract
We study the problem of recognition of fingerspelled letter sequences in American Sign Language in a signer-independent setting. Fingerspelled sequences are both challenging and important to recognize, as they are used for many content words such as proper nouns and technical terms. Previous work has shown that it is possible to achieve almost 90% accuracies on fingerspelling recognition in a signer-dependent setting. However, the more realistic signer-independent setting presents challenges due to significant variations among signers, coupled with the dearth of available training data. We investigate this problem with approaches inspired by automatic speech recognition. We start with the best-performing approaches from prior work, based on tandem models and segmental conditional random fields (SCRFs), with features based on deep neural network (DNN) classifiers of letters and phonological features. Using DNN adaptation, we find that it is possible to bridge a large part of the gap between signer-dependent and signer-independent performance. Using only about 115 transcribed words for adaptation from the target signer, we obtain letter accuracies of up to 82.7% with frame-level adaptation labels and 69.7% with only word labels.

我们在独立于签名者的环境中研究美国手语识别手指式字母序列的问题。指纹序列既具有挑战性也很重要，因为它们被用于诸如专有名词和专业术语等许多内容词汇。以前的研究表明，在依赖签名者的环境中，通过手势识别可以达到近90％的准确率。然而，由于签名者之间的重大差异，以及缺乏可用的训练数据，更符合实际的独立于签名者的设置提出了挑战。我们用自动语音识别的方法来调查这个问题。我们从基于串联模型和分段条件随机场（SCRF）的基于深度神经网络（DNN）分类器的字母和音韵特征的特征开始，从先前的工作中表现最好的方法。使用DNN自适应，我们发现有可能弥补签名者依赖和签名者独立性能之间的大部分差距。对于目标签名者，只用约115个转录词进行自适应调整，得到的字面精度最高可达82.7％，只有词标签可达69.7％。
