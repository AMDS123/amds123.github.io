##### Abstract
Our premise is that autonomous vehicles must optimize communications and motion planning jointly. Specifically, a vehicle must adapt its motion plan staying cognizant of communications rate related constraints and adapt the use of communications while being cognizant of motion planning related restrictions that may be imposed by the on-road environment. To this end, we formulate a reinforcement learning problem wherein an autonomous vehicle jointly chooses (a) a motion planning action that executes on-road and (b) a communications action of querying sensed information from the infrastructure. The goal is to optimize the driving utility of the autonomous vehicle. We apply the Q-learning algorithm to make the vehicle learn the optimal policy, which makes the optimal choice of planning and communications actions at any given time. We demonstrate the ability of the optimal policy to smartly adapt communications and planning actions, while achieving large driving utilities, using simulations.

我们的前提是自动驾驶汽车必须共同优化通信和运动规划。具体地，车辆必须使其运动计划适应于保持认识到通信速率相关的约束并且在认识到可能由路上环境施加的运动规划相关限制的同时适应通信的使用。为此，我们制定了强化学习问题，其中自主车辆联合选择（a）在路上执行的运动规划动作和（b）从基础设施查询感测信息的通信动作。目标是优化自动驾驶车辆的驾驶效用。我们应用Q学习算法使车辆学习最优策略，这使得在任何给定时间的计划和通信动作的最佳选择。我们展示了最优策略能够巧妙地适应通信和规划操作，同时使用模拟实现大型驱动实用程序。
