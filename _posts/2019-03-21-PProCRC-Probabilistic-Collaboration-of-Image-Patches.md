##### Abstract
We present a conditional probabilistic framework for collaborative representation of image patches. It in-corporates background compensation and outlier patch suppression into the main formulation itself, thus doingaway with the need for pre-processing steps to handle the same. A closed form non-iterative solution of the costfunction is derived. The proposed method (PProCRC) outperforms earlier related patch based (PCRC, GP-CRC)as well as the state-of-the-art probabilistic (ProCRC and EProCRC) models on several fine-grained benchmarkimage datasets for face recognition (AR and LFW) and species recognition (Oxford Flowers and Pets) tasks.We also expand our recent endemic Indian birds (IndBirds) dataset and report results on it. The demo code andIndBirds dataset are available through lead author.
