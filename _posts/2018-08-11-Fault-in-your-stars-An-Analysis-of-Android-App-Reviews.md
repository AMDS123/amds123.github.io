##### Abstract
Mobile app distribution platforms such as Google Play Store allow users to share their feedback about downloaded apps in the form of a review comment and a corresponding star rating. Typically, the star rating ranges from one to five stars, with one star denoting a high sense of dissatisfaction with the app and five stars denoting a high sense of satisfaction. 
 Unfortunately, due to a variety of reasons, often the star rating provided by a user is inconsistent with the opinion expressed in the review. For example, consider the following review for the Facebook App on Android; "Awesome App". One would reasonably expect the rating for this review to be five stars, but the actual rating is one star! 
 Such inconsistent ratings can lead to a deflated (or inflated) overall average rating of an app which can affect user downloads, as typically users look at the average star ratings while making a decision on downloading an app. Also, the app developers receive a biased feedback about the application that does not represent ground reality. This is especially significant for small apps with a few thousand downloads as even a small number of mismatched reviews can bring down the average rating drastically. 
 In this paper, we conducted a study on this review-rating mismatch problem. We manually examined 8600 reviews from 10 popular Android apps and found that 20% of the ratings in our dataset were inconsistent with the review. Further, we developed three systems; two of which were based on traditional machine learning and one on deep learning to automatically identify reviews whose rating did not match with the opinion expressed in the review. Our deep learning system performed the best and had an accuracy of 92% in identifying the correct star rating to be associated with a given review.

##### Abstract (translated by Google)
移动应用分发平台（如Google Play商店）允许用户以评论评论和相应的星级评分的形式分享他们对下载的应用的反馈。通常情况下，星级评分范围从1到5星，其中一颗星表示对应用程序的高度不满，而五颗星则表示高度满意。
 不幸的是，由于各种原因，用户提供的星级评分通常与评论中表达的观点不一致。例如，考虑对Android上的Facebook应用程序进行以下审核; “很棒的应用程序”。有人会合理地期望这次评论的评级是五星级，但实际评级是一颗星！
 这种不一致的评级可能导致应用程序的缩小（或夸大）整体平均评级，这会影响用户下载，因为通常用户在下载应用程序时会查看平均星级评级。此外，应用程序开发人员收到有关应用程序的偏见反馈，这些反馈并不代表基础现实。这对于拥有几千下载量的小型应用程序尤其重要，因为即使少量不匹配的评论也会大幅降低平均评级。
 在本文中，我们对此评审评级不匹配问题进行了研究。我们从10个热门Android应用程序手动检查了8600条评论，发现我们数据集中20％的评分与评论不一致。此外，我们开发了三个系统;其中两个基于传统的机器学习，另一个基于深度学习，以自动识别评级与评论中表达的观点不匹配的评论。我们的深度学习系统表现最佳，并且在确定与给定评论相关的正确星级评分时具有92％的准确度。
