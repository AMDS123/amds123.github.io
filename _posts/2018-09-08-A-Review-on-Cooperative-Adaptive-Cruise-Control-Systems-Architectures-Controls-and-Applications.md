##### Abstract
Connected and automated vehicles (CAVs) have the potential to address the safety, mobility and sustainability issues of our current transportation systems. Cooperative adaptive cruise control (CACC), for example, is one promising technology to allow CAVs to be driven in a cooperative manner and introduces system-wide benefits. In this paper, we review the progress achieved by researchers worldwide regarding different aspects of CACC systems. Literature of CACC system architectures are reviewed, which explain how this system works from a higher level. Different control methodologies and their related issues are reviewed to introduce CACC systems from a lower level. Applications of CACC technology are demonstrated with detailed literature, which draw an overall landscape of CACC, point out current opportunities and challenges, and anticipate its development in the near future.

##### Abstract (translated by Google)
联网和自动车辆（CAV）有可能解决我们当前运输系统的安全性，移动性和可持续性问题。例如，协同自适应巡航控制（CACC）是一种有前景的技术，它允许CAV以合作的方式驱动并引入系统范围的益处。在本文中，我们回顾了全球研究人员在CACC系统不同方面取得的进展。回顾了CACC系统架构的文献，解释了该系统如何在更高层次上运行。审查了不同的控制方法及其相关问题，以便从较低层面介绍CACC系统。 CACC技术的应用通过详细的文献进行了论证，这些文献描绘了CACC的整体情况，指出了当前的机遇和挑战，并预测了它在不久的将来的发展。
