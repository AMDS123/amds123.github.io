##### Abstract
The growing presence of devices carrying digital cameras, such as mobile phones and tablets, combined with ever improving internet networks have enabled ordinary citizens, victims of human rights abuse, and participants in armed conflicts, protests, and disaster situations to capture and share via social media networks images and videos of specific events. This paper discusses the potential of images in human rights context including the opportunities and challenges they present. This study demonstrates that real-world images have the capacity to contribute complementary data to operational human rights monitoring efforts when combined with novel computer vision approaches. The analysis is concluded by arguing that if images are to be used effectively to detect and identify human rights violations by rights advocates, greater attention to gathering task-specific visual concepts from large-scale web images is required.

##### Abstract (translated by Google)
携带数码相机（如手机和平板电脑）的设备日益增多，加上不断改进的互联网，使普通公民，受到侵犯人权的受害者，参与武装冲突，抗议和灾难的人们能够通过社交媒体网络图片和特定事件的视频。本文讨论了形象在人权环境中的潜力，包括他们所面临的机遇和挑战。这项研究表明，真实世界的图像有能力与新的计算机视觉方法相结合，为业务人权监测工作提供补充数据。分析得出的结论是，如果要有效地使用图像来检测和识别维权人士侵犯人权的行为，则需要更多地关注从大规模网络图像中收集特定于任务的视觉概念。
