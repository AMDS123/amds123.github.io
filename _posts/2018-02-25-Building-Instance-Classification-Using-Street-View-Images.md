##### Abstract
Land-use classification based on spaceborne or aerial remote sensing images has been extensively studied over the past decades. Such classification is usually a patch-wise or pixel-wise labeling over the whole image. But for many applications, such as urban population density mapping or urban utility planning, a classification map based on individual buildings is much more informative. However, such semantic classification still poses some fundamental challenges, for example, how to retrieve fine boundaries of individual buildings. In this paper, we proposed a general framework for classifying the functionality of individual buildings. The proposed method is based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) which classify facade structures from street view images, such as Google StreetView, in addition to remote sensing images which usually only show roof structures. Geographic information was utilized to mask out individual buildings, and to associate the corresponding street view images. We created a benchmark dataset which was used for training and evaluating CNNs. In addition, the method was applied to generate building classification maps on both region and city scales of several cities in Canada and the US. Keywords: CNN, Building instance classification, Street view images, OpenStreetMap

##### Abstract (translated by Google)
过去几十年来，基于星载或航空遥感图像的土地利用分类得到了广泛的研究。这种分类通常是在整个图像上进行贴片或像素标签。但对于许多应用，例如城市人口密度测绘或城市公用事业规划，基于单个建筑物的分类图更具信息性。然而，这样的语义分类仍然带来了一些基本的挑战，例如，如何检索单个建筑物的精细边界。在本文中，我们提出了分类建筑物功能的一般框架。所提出的方法基于卷积神经网络（CNN），其除了通常仅显示屋顶结构的遥感图像之外，还对街景图像（例如Google StreetView）的立面结构进行分类。利用地理信息掩盖各个建筑物，并将相应的街景图像关联起来。我们创建了一个基准数据集，用于培训和评估CNN。此外，该方法还应用于生成加拿大和美国多个城市的地区和城市规模的建筑物分类图。关键字：CNN，建筑物实例分类，街景图像，OpenStreetMap
