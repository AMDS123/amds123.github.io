##### Abstract
Automatic plant recognition and disease analysis may be streamlined by an image of a complete, isolated leaf as an initial input. Segmenting leaves from natural images is a hard problem. Cluttered and complex backgrounds: often composed of other leaves are commonplace. Furthermore, their appearance is highly dependent upon illumination and viewing perspective. In order to address these issues we propose a methodology which exploits the leaves venous systems in tandem with other low level features. Background and leaf markers are created using colour, intensity and texture. Two approaches are investigated: watershed and graph-cut and results compared. Primary-secondary vein detection and a protrusion-notch removal are applied to refine the extracted leaf. The efficacy of our approach is demonstrated against existing work.

自动植物识别和疾病分析可以通过完整的，分离的叶子的图像作为初始输入来简化。从自然图像中分割出叶子是一个难题。杂乱和复杂的背景：通常由其他叶子组成是常见的。此外，它们的外观高度依赖于照明和观看的角度。为了解决这些问题，我们提出了一种方法，利用叶静脉系统与其他低级功能相结合。背景和叶子标记是使用颜色，强度和纹理创建的。调查两种方法：分水岭和图切割和结果比较。应用一次 - 二次静脉检测和突出 - 凹槽去除来精炼提取的叶子。我们的方法的有效性证明了对现有的工作。
