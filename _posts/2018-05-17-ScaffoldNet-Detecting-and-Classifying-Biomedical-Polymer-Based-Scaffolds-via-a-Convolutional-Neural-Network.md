##### Abstract
We developed a Convolutional Neural Network model to identify and classify Airbrushed (alternatively known as Blow-spun), Electrospun and Steel Wire scaffolds. Our model ScaffoldNet is a 6-layer Convolutional Neural Network trained and tested on 3,043 images of Airbrushed, Electrospun and Steel Wire scaffolds. The model takes in as input an imaged scaffold and then outputs the scaffold type (Airbrushed, Electrospun or Steel Wire) as predicted probabilities for the 3 classes. Our model scored a 99.44% Accuracy, demonstrating potential for adaptation to investigating and solving complex machine learning problems aimed at abstract spatial contexts, or in screening complex, biological, fibrous structures seen in cortical bone and fibrous shells.

我们开发了卷积神经网络模型来识别和分类喷刷（或称为吹塑），电纺丝和钢丝脚手架。我们的ScaffoldNet模型是一个6层​​卷积神经网络，训练并测试了3043张喷枪，电纺丝和钢丝脚手架的图像。该模型输入一个成像的脚手架，然后输出脚手架类型（喷枪，静电纺丝或钢丝）作为3类的预测概率。我们的模型得到了99.44％的准确度，展示了适应调查和解决针对抽象空间背景的复杂机器学习问题或筛选皮质骨和纤维壳中所见的复杂的生物纤维结构的潜力。
