##### Abstract
We examine two recent artificial intelligence (AI) based deep learning algorithms for visual blending in convolutional neural networks (Mordvintsev et al. 2015, Gatys et al. 2015). To investigate the potential value of these algorithms as tools for computational creativity research, we explain and schematize the essential aspects of the algorithms' operation and give visual examples of their output. We discuss the relationship of the two algorithms to human cognitive science theories of creativity such as conceptual blending theory and honing theory, and characterize the algorithms with respect to generation of novelty and aesthetic quality.
