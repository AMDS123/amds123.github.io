##### Abstract
In the light of exponentially increasing video content, video summarization has attracted a lot of attention recently due to its ability to optimize time and storage. Characteristics of a good summary of a video depend on the particular domain under question. We propose a novel framework for domain specific video summarization. Given a video of a particular domain, our system can produce a summary based on what is important for that domain in addition to possessing other desired characteristics like representativeness, coverage, diversity etc. as suitable to that domain. Past related work has focused either on using supervised approaches for ranking the snippets to produce summary or on using unsupervised approaches of generating the summary as a subset of snippets with the above characteristics. We look at the joint problem of learning domain specific importance of segments as well as the desired summary characteristic for that domain. Our studies show that the more efficient way of incorporating domain specific relevances into a summary is by obtaining ratings of shots as opposed to binary inclusion/exclusion information. We also argue that ratings can be seen as unified representation of all possible ground truth summaries of a video, taking us one step closer in dealing with challenges associated with multiple ground truth summaries of a video. We also propose a novel evaluation measure which is more naturally suited in assessing the quality of video summary for the task at hand than F1 like measures. It leverages the ratings information and is richer in appropriately modeling desirable and undesirable characteristics of a summary. Lastly, we release a gold standard dataset for furthering research in domain specific video summarization, which to our knowledge is the first dataset with long videos across several domains with rating annotations.
