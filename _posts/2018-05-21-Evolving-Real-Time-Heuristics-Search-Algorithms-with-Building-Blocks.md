##### Abstract
The research area of real-time heuristics search has produced quite many algorithms. In the landscape of real-time heuristics search research, it is not rare to find that an algorithm X that appears to perform better than algorithm Y on a group of problems, performed worse than Y for another group of problems. If these published algorithms are combined to generate a more powerful space of algorithms, then that novel space of algorithms may solve a distribution of problems more efficiently. Based on this intuition, a recent work Bulitko 2016 has defined the task of finding a combination of heuristics search algorithms as a survival task. In this evolutionary approach, a space of algorithms is defined over a set of building blocks published algorithms and a simulated evolution is used to recombine these building blocks to find out the best algorithm from that space of algorithms. In this paper, we extend the set of building blocks by adding one published algorithm, namely lookahead based A-star shaped local search space generation method from LSSLRTA-star, plus an unpublished novel strategy to generate local search space with Greedy Best First Search. Then we perform experiments in the new space of algorithms, which show that the best algorithms selected by the evolutionary process have the following property: the deeper is the lookahead depth of an algorithm, the lower is its suboptimality and scrubbing complexity.

实时启发式搜索的研究领域产生了相当多的算法。在实时启发式搜索研究的情况下，发现算法X在一组问题上看起来比算法Y执行得更好，对另一组问题执行比Y更差的问题并不罕见。如果将这些公布的算法组合起来以生成更强大的算法空间，那么算法的这种新颖空间可以更有效地解决问题的分布。基于这种直觉，最近的一项工作Bulitko 2016已经定义了寻找启发式搜索算法组合作为生存任务的任务。在这种演化方法中，算法空间定义在一组构建模块发布的算法上，并且使用模拟演化来重新组合这些构建模块以从该算法空间找出最佳算法。在本文中，我们通过添加一个已发布的算法来扩展构建块集合，即LSSLRTA-star的基于lookahead的A星形局部搜索空间生成方法，以及一个用Greedy Best First Search生成局部搜索空间的未发布的新策略。然后，我们在算法的新空间中进行实验，这表明进化过程选择的最佳算法具有以下性质：算法的前瞻深度越深，其次优性和清理复杂性越低。
