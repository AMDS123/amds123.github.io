##### Abstract
Query images presented to content-based image retrieval systems often have various different interpretations, making it difficult to identify the search objective pursued by the user. We propose a technique for overcoming this ambiguity, while keeping the amount of required user interaction at a minimum. To achieve this, the neighborhood of the query image is divided into coherent clusters from which the user may choose the relevant ones. A novel feedback integration technique is then employed to re-rank the entire database with regard to both the user feedback and the original query. We evaluate our approach on the publicly available MIRFLICKR-25K dataset, where it leads to a relative improvement of average precision by 23% over the baseline retrieval, which does not distinguish between different image senses.

呈现给基于内容的图像检索系统的查询图像通常具有各种不同的解释，使得难以识别用户追求的搜索目标。我们提出一种克服这种模糊性的技术，同时保持所需的用户交互量最小。为了实现这一点，查询图像的邻域被划分为连贯的簇，用户可以从中选择相关簇。然后采用新颖的反馈集成技术来重新对用户反馈和原始查询两者的整个数据库进行排序。我们在公开可用的MIRFLICKR-25K数据集上评估我们的方法，其中平均精度比基线检索相对提高了23％，这不能区分不同的图像感觉。
