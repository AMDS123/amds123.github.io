##### Abstract
Everyday place descriptions often contain place names of fine-grained features, such as buildings or businesses, that are more difficult to disambiguate than names referring to larger places, for example cities or natural geographic features. Fine-grained places are often significantly more frequent and more similar to each other, and disambiguation heuristics developed for larger places, such as those based on population or containment relationships, are often not applicable in these cases. In this research, we address the disambiguation of fine-grained place names from everyday place descriptions. For this purpose, we evaluate the performance of different existing clustering-based approaches, since clustering approaches require no more knowledge other than the locations of ambiguous place names. We consider not only approaches developed specifically for place name disambiguation, but also clustering algorithms developed for general data mining that could potentially be leveraged. We compare these methods with a novel algorithm, and show that the novel algorithm outperforms the other algorithms in terms of disambiguation precision and distance error over several tested datasets.

日常地点描述通常包含细粒度特征的地名，例如建筑物或商业，比指向较大地方的名称（例如城市或自然地理特征）更难消除歧义。细粒度的位置通常更加频繁并且彼此更相似，并且针对较大位置（例如基于人口或遏制关系的位置）开发的消歧启发法通常不适用于这些情况。在这项研究中，我们解决了从日常场所描述中消除细粒度地名的歧义。为此，我们评估了不同的现有基于聚类的方法的性能，因为聚类方法除了模糊地名的位置之外不需要更多的知识。我们不仅考虑专门针对地名消歧而开发的方法，还考虑为可能被利用的一般数据挖掘开发的聚类算法。我们将这些方法与一种新算法进行了比较，并表明该算法在几个测试数据集的消歧精度和距离误差方面优于其他算法。
