##### Abstract
Deep neural networks (DNNs) have a high accuracy on image classification tasks. However, DNNs trained by such dataset with co-occurrence bias may rely on wrong features while making decisions for classification. It will greatly affect the transferability of pre-trained DNNs. In this paper, we propose an interactive method to direct classifiers paying attentions to the regions that are manually specified by the users, in order to mitigate the influence of co-occurrence bias. We test on CelebA dataset, the pre-trained AlexNet is fine-tuned to focus on the specific facial attributes based on the results of Grad-CAM.
