##### Abstract
We report GaN n++/p++ interband tunnel junctions with repeatable negative differential resistance and low resistance. Reverse and forward tunneling current densities were observed to increase as Si and Mg doping concentrations were increased. Hysteresis-free, bidirectional negative differential resistance was observed at room temperature from these junctions at a forward voltage of ~1.6-2 V. Thermionic PN junctions with tunnel contact to the p-layer exhibited forward current density of 150 kA/cm^2 at 7.6 V, with a low series device resistance of 1 x 10^-5 ohm.cm^2.

我们报告GaN n ++ / p ++带间隧道结与可重复负微分电阻和低电阻。观察到反向和正向隧道电流密度随着Si和Mg掺杂浓度的增加而增加。在室温下，在正向电压为1.6-2V时，在室温下观察到无滞后的双向负微分电阻。具有到p层的隧道接触的热离子PN结表现出150kA / cm 2的正向电流密度7.6 V，低串联器件电阻为1×10 ^ -5 ohm.cm ^ 2。
