##### Abstract
Hyperspectral image (HSI) denoising is a crucial preprocessing procedure to improve the performance of the subsequent HSI interpretation and applications. In this paper, a novel deep learning-based method for this task is proposed, by learning a non-linear end-to-end mapping between the noisy and clean HSIs with a combined spatial-spectral deep convolutional neural network (HSID-CNN). Both the spatial and spectral information are simultaneously assigned to the proposed network. In addition, multi-scale feature extraction and multi-level feature representation are respectively employed to capture both the multi-scale spatial-spectral feature and fuse the feature representations with different levels for the final restoration. In addition, to maintain the stability and efficiency of the learning procedure, the reconstructed output is represented with residual mode instead of straightforward results. The simulated and real-data experiments demonstrate that the proposed HSID-CNN outperforms many of the mainstream methods in both the quantitative evaluation indexes, visual effects, and HSI classification accuracy.

高光谱图像（HSI）去噪是提高后续HSI解释和应用性能的关键预处理程序。本文提出了一种新的基于深度学习的方法，该方法通过学习噪声和干净HSI之间的非线性端到端映射与组合空间谱深度卷积神经网络（HSID-CNN） 。空间和频谱信息同时被分配给建议的网络。此外，分别采用多尺度特征提取和多尺度特征表示来捕获多尺度空间光谱特征，并将最终恢复的特征表征与不同水平融合。另外，为了保持学习过程的稳定性和效率，重构输出用残余模式表示，而不是直接结果。模拟和实际数据实验表明，所提出的HSID-CNN在量化评估指标，视觉效果和HSI分类准确性方面均优于许多主流方法。
