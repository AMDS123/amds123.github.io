##### Abstract
Backdoors and backbones of Boolean formulas are hidden structural properties. A natural goal, already in part realized, is that solver algorithms seek to obtain substantially better performance by exploiting these structures. 
 However, the present paper is not intended to improve the performance of SAT solvers, but rather is a cautionary paper. In particular, the theme of this paper is that there is a potential chasm between the existence of such structures in the Boolean formula and being able to effectively exploit them. This does not mean that these structures are not useful to solvers. It does mean that one must be very careful not to assume that it is computationally easy to go from the existence of a structure to being able to get one's hands on it and/or being able to exploit the structure. 
 For example, in this paper we show that, under the assumption that P $\neq$ NP, there are easily recognizable sets of Boolean formulas for which it is hard to determine whether they have a large backbone. We also show that, also under the assumption P $\neq$ NP, there are easily recognizable families of Boolean formulas with strong backdoors that are easy to find, yet for which it is hard to determine whether they are satisfiable.

布尔公式的后门和主干是隐藏的结构属性。已经部分意识到的一个自然目标是解算器算法通过利用这些结构来获得更好的性能。
 然而，本文不打算改进SAT求解器的性能，而是一个警告文件。特别是，本文的主题是布尔公式中这些结构的存在与能够有效利用它们之间存在潜在的鸿沟。这并不意味着这些结构对解算器没有用处。这确实意味着人们必须非常小心，不要认为从一个结构的存在到在其上能够获得和/或能够利用该结构在计算上是容易的。
 例如，在本文中，我们表明，在假设P $ \ neq $ NP的情况下，有很容易识别的布尔公式集，很难确定它们是否具有大的骨干。我们还表明，在假设P $ \ neq $ NP的情况下，还有容易识别的具有强大后门的布尔公式家族很容易找到，但是很难确定它们是否可满足。
