##### Abstract
Reinforcement learning is considered as a promising direction for driving policy learning. However, training autonomous driving vehicle with reinforcement learning in real environment involves non-affordable trial-and-error. It is more desirable to first train in a virtual environment and then transfer to the real environment. In this paper, we propose a novel realistic translation network to make model trained in virtual environment be workable in real world. The proposed network can convert non-realistic virtual image input into a realistic one with similar scene structure. Given realistic frames as input, driving policy trained by reinforcement learning can nicely adapt to real world driving. Experiments show that our proposed virtual to real (VR) reinforcement learning (RL) works pretty well. To our knowledge, this is the first successful case of driving policy trained by reinforcement learning that can adapt to real world driving data.

强化学习被认为是推动政策学习的有希望的方向。然而，在真实环境中进行强化学习的自主驾驶车辆的培训涉及不实惠的反复试验。首先在虚拟环境中训练，然后转移到真实的环境中是比较理想的。在本文中，我们提出了一个新颖的现实翻译网络，使在虚拟环境中训练的模型在现实世界中可行。所提出的网络可以将非现实的虚拟图像输入转换成具有相似场景结构的逼真虚拟图像输入。以真实的框架作为输入，强化学习训练的驾驶策略可以很好地适应现实世界的驾驶。实验表明，我们提出的虚拟到真实（VR）强化学习（RL）工作得很好。据我们所知，这是强化学习能够适应现实驾驶数据的驾驶策略的第一个成功案例。
