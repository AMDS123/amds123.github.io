##### Abstract
A general, system-independent formulation of the parabolic Schrödinger-Poisson equation is presented for a charged hard wall in the limit of complete screening by the ground state. It is solved numerically using iteration and asymptotic-boundary conditions. The solution gives a simple relation between the band bending and charge density at an interface. I further develop approximative analytical forms for the potential and wave function, based on properties of the exact solution. Specific tests of the validity of the assumptions leading to the general solution are made. The assumption of complete screening by the ground state is found be a limitation; however, the general solution still provides a fair approximate account of the potential when the bulk is doped. The general solution is further used in a simple model for the potential profile of an AlN/GaN barrier, and gives an approximation which compares well with the solution of the full Schrödinger-Poisson equation.
