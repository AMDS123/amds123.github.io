##### Abstract
Segmentation of retinal vessels from retinal fundus images is the key step in the automatic retinal image analysis. In this paper, we propose a new unsupervised automatic method to segment the retinal vessels from retinal fundus images. Contrast enhancement and illumination correction are carried out through a series of image processing steps followed by adaptive histogram equalization and anisotropic diffusion filtering. This image is then converted to a gray scale using weighted scaling. The vessel edges are enhanced by boosting the detail curvelet coefficients. Optic disk pixels are removed before applying fuzzy C-mean classification to avoid the misclassification. Morphological operations and connected component analysis are applied to obtain the segmented retinal vessels. The performance of the proposed method is evaluated using DRIVE database to be able to compare with other state-of-art supervised and unsupervised methods. The overall segmentation accuracy of the proposed method is 95.18% which outperforms the other algorithms.

从视网膜底图像分割视网膜血管是自动视网膜图像分析的关键步骤。在本文中，我们提出了一种新的无监督自动方法从视网膜眼底图像分割视网膜血管。对比度增强和光照校正是通过一系列图像处理步骤，然后是自适应直方图均衡和各向异性扩散滤波来进行的。然后使用加权缩放将该图像转换为灰度。通过提高细节曲线系数来增强血管边缘。在应用模糊C均值分类之前去除光盘像素以避免误分类。应用形态学操作和连接成分分析来获得分割的视网膜血管。使用DRIVE数据库评估所提出的方法的性能，以便能够与其他现有技术的监督和无监督方法进行比较。该方法的整体分割精度为95.18％，优于其他算法。
