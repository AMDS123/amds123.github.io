##### Abstract
Model-based compression is an effective, facilitating, and expanded model of neural network models with limited computing and low power. However, conventional models of compression techniques utilize crafted features [2,3,12] and explore specialized areas for exploration and design of large spaces in terms of size, speed, and accuracy, which usually have returns Less and time is up. This paper will effectively analyze deep auto compression (ADC) and reinforcement learning strength in an effective sample and space design, and improve the compression quality of the model. The results of compression of the advanced model are obtained without any human effort and in a completely automated way. With a 4- fold reduction in FLOP, the accuracy of 2.8% is higher than the manual compression model for VGG-16 in ImageNet.

基于模型的压缩是一种有效，便利和扩展的神经网络模型模型，具有有限的计算和低功耗。然而，传统的压缩技术模型利用精心设计的特征[2,3,12]，并探索在大小，速度和准确性方面进行大空间探索和设计的专业领域，这些领域通常具有较少的回报和时间。本文将在有效的样本和空间设计中有效地分析深度自动压缩（ADC）和强化学习强度，并提高模型的压缩质量。无需任何人力和完全自动化的方式获得高级模型的压缩结果。 FLOP降低4倍，2.8％的准确度高于ImageNet中VGG-16的手动压缩模型。
