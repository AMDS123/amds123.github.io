##### Abstract
The data collected by smart meters contain a lot of useful information. One potential use of the data is to track the energy consumptions and operating statuses of major home appliances.The results will enable homeowners to make sound decisions on how to save energy and how to participate in demand response programs. This paper presents a new method to breakdown the total power demand measured by a smart meter to those used by individual appliances. A unique feature of the proposed method is that it utilizes diverse signatures associated with the entire operating window of an appliance for identification. As a result, appliances with complicated middle process can be tracked. A novel appliance registration device and scheme is also proposed to automate the creation of appliance signature database and to eliminate the need of massive training before identification. The software and system have been developed and deployed to real houses in order to verify the proposed method.

智能电表收集的数据包含大量有用的信息。数据的一个潜在用途是跟踪主要家用电器的能源消耗和运行状态。结果将使房主能够就如何节约能源以及如何参与需求响应计划做出合理的决定。本文提出了一种将智能电表测量的总电力需求分解为单个电器使用的总电力需求的新方法。所提出的方法的独特之处在于它利用与器具的整个操作窗口相关联的多种签名进行识别。因此，可以追踪具有复杂中间过程的电器。还提出了一种新颖的设备注册设备和方案，用于自动创建设备签名数据库并消除在识别之前进行大规模培训的需要。为了验证所提出的方法，软件和系统已经开发并部署到真实房屋中。
