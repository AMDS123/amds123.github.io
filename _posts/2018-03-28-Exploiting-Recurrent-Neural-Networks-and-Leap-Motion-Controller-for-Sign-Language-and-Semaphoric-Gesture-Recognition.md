##### Abstract
In human interactions, hands are a powerful way of expressing information that, in some cases, can be used as a valid substitute for voice, as it happens in Sign Language. Hand gesture recognition has always been an interesting topic in the areas of computer vision and multimedia. These gestures can be represented as sets of feature vectors that change over time. Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) are suited to analyse this type of sets thanks to their ability to model the long term contextual information of temporal sequences. In this paper, a RNN is trained by using as features the angles formed by the finger bones of human hands. The selected features, acquired by a Leap Motion Controller (LMC) sensor, have been chosen because the majority of human gestures produce joint movements that generate truly characteristic corners. A challenging subset composed by a large number of gestures defined by the American Sign Language (ASL) is used to test the proposed solution and the effectiveness of the selected angles. Moreover, the proposed method has been compared to other state of the art works on the SHREC dataset, thus demonstrating its superiority in hand gesture recognition accuracy.

##### Abstract (translated by Google)
在人际交往中，手是表达信息的有力方式，在某些情况下，手可以用作语音的有效替代品，正如手语中所发生的一样。手势识别一直是计算机视觉和多媒体领域的一个有趣话题。这些手势可以表示为随时间变化的特征向量集合。递归神经网络（RNN）适合分析这种类型的集合，这要归功于它们对时间序列的长期上下文信息进行建模的能力。在本文中，通过使用人手指骨形成的角度作为特征来训练RNN。由Leap Motion Controller（LMC）传感器获取的选定特征已被选中，因为大部分人体手势产生了可产生真正特征角的关节运动。由美国手语（ASL）定义的大量手势组成的具有挑战性的子集用于测试所提出的解决方案和所选角度的有效性。此外，所提出的方法已经与SHREC数据集上的其他艺术作品进行比较，因此证明了其在手势识别精度方面的优势。
