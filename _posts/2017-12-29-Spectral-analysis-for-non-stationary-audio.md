##### Abstract
A new approach for the analysis of non-stationary signals is proposed, with a focus on audio applications. Following earlier contributions, non-stationarity is modeled via stationarity-breaking operators acting on Gaussian stationary random signals. The focus is here on time warping and amplitude modulation, and an approximate maximum-likelihood approach based on suitable approximations in the wavelet transform domain is developed. This papers provides theoretical analysis of the approximations, and describes and analyses a correspondingestimation algorithm. The latter is tested and validated on synthetic as well as real audio signal.

提出了一种分析非平稳信号的新方法，重点放在音频应用上。在早些时候的贡献之后，非平稳性是通过破坏稳定的随机信号操作的破坏性操作符来模拟的。重点在于时间扭曲和幅度调制，并且在小波变换域中开发了基于适当近似的近似最大似然方法。本文提供了近似的理论分析，并描述和分析了相应的估计算法。后者在合成以及真实的音频信号上进行测试和验证。
