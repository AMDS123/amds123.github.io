##### Abstract
Egocentric videos, which mainly record the activities carried out by the users of the wearable cameras, have drawn much research attentions in recent years. Due to its lengthy content, a large number of ego-related applications have been developed to abstract the captured videos. As the users are accustomed to interacting with the target objects using their own hands while their hands usually appear within their visual fields during the interaction, an egocentric hand detection step is involved in tasks like gesture recognition, action recognition and social interaction understanding. In this work, we propose a dynamic region growing approach for hand region detection in egocentric videos, by jointly considering hand-related motion and egocentric cues. We first determine seed regions that most likely belong to the hand, by analyzing the motion patterns across successive frames. The hand regions can then be located by extending from the seed regions, according to the scores computed for the adjacent superpixels. These scores are derived from four egocentric cues: contrast, location, position consistency and appearance continuity. We discuss how to apply the proposed method in real-life scenarios, where multiple hands irregularly appear and disappear from the videos. Experimental results on public datasets show that the proposed method achieves superior performance compared with the state-of-the-art methods, especially in complicated scenarios.

主要记录可穿戴摄像机用户进行的活动的以自我为中心的视频近年来引起了越来越多的研究关注。由于其内容冗长，大量自我相关的应用程序已经被开发来提取所捕获的视频。由于用户习惯于使用自己的双手与目标物体进行交互，而双手在交互过程中通常出现在视野内，所以在手势识别，动作识别和社交互动理解等任务中涉及自我中心手部检测步骤。在这项工作中，我们提出了一个动态区域增长方法，用于手势区域检测的自我中心视频，通过共同考虑手相关运动和自我中心线索。我们首先通过分析连续帧的运动模式来确定最有可能属于手的种子区域。然后可以根据针对相邻超像素所计算的得分，通过从种子区域延伸来定位手区域。这些得分来自四个自我中心的线索：对比，地点，位置一致性和外观连续性。我们讨论了如何将这个方法应用到现实生活中，其中多只手不规则地出现在视频中并且消失。在公共数据集上的实验结果表明，与现有技术相比，所提出的方法具有更好的性能，特别是在复杂情况下。
