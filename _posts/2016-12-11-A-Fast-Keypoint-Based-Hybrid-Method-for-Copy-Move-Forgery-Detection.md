##### Abstract
Copy move forgery detection in digital images has become a very popular research topic in the area of image forensics. Due to the availability of sophisticated image editing tools and ever increasing hardware capabilities, it has become an easy task to manipulate the digital images. Passive forgery detection techniques are more relevant as they can be applied without the prior information about the image in question. Block based techniques are used to detect copy move forgery, but have limitations of large time complexity and sensitivity against affine operations like rotation and scaling. Keypoint based approaches are used to detect forgery in large images where the possibility of significant post processing operations like rotation and scaling is more. A hybrid approach is proposed using different methods for keypoint detection and description. Speeded Up Robust Features (SURF) are used to detect the keypoints in the image and Binary Robust Invariant Scalable Keypoints (BRISK) features are used to describe features at these keypoints. The proposed method has performed better than the existing forgery detection method using SURF significantly in terms of detection speed and is invariant to post processing operations like rotation and scaling. The proposed method is also invariant to other commonly applied post processing operations like adding Gaussian noise and JPEG compression

在数字图像中复制移动伪造检测已成为图像取证领域非常受欢迎的研究课题。由于复杂的图像编辑工具的可用性和不断提高的硬件功能，操作数字图像变得非常容易。被动伪造检测技术更为相关，因为它们可以在没有关于所讨论的图像的先前信息的情况下被应用。基于块的技术被用于检测复制移动伪造，但是对于仿射操作（例如旋转和缩放）具有大的时间复杂度和敏感度的限制。基于关键点的方法被用于检测大图像中的伪造，其中诸如旋转和缩放的重要后处理操作的可能性更大。提出了一种混合方法，使用不同的关键点检测和描述方法。加速稳健特征（SURF）用于检测图像中的关键点，二进制稳健不变可伸缩关键点（BRISK）特征用于描述这些关键点的特征。所提出的方法比现有的使用SURF的伪造检测方法在检测速度方面表现出明显的优势，并且对旋转和缩放等后处理操作不变。所提出的方法对其他常用的后处理操作（如添加高斯噪声和JPEG压缩）也是不变的
