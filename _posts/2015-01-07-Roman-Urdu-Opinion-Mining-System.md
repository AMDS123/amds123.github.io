##### Abstract
Convincing a customer is always considered as a challenging task in every business. But when it comes to online business, this task becomes even more difficult. Online retailers try everything possible to gain the trust of the customer. One of the solutions is to provide an area for existing users to leave their comments. This service can effectively develop the trust of the customer however normally the customer comments about the product in their native language using Roman script. If there are hundreds of comments this makes difficulty even for the native customers to make a buying decision. This research proposes a system which extracts the comments posted in Roman Urdu, translate them, find their polarity and then gives us the rating of the product. This rating will help the native and non-native customers to make buying decision efficiently from the comments posted in Roman Urdu.

##### Abstract (translated by Google)
说服客户一直被认为是每个企业的一项具有挑战性的任务。但是当谈到在线业务时，这个任务变得更加困难。网上零售商尽一切可能获得客户的信任。其中一个解决方案是为现有用户提供一个可以留下评论的区域。这项服务可以有效地发展客户的信任，但是客户通常使用罗马字母来评估他们的母语产品。如果有数百条评论，这使得即使是本地客户做出购买决定也会遇到困难。这项研究提出了一个系统，提取在罗马乌尔都语发布的意见，翻译他们，找到他们的极性，然后给我们的产品评级。该评级将有助于本地和非本地客户从罗马乌尔都语发布的评论中有效地作出购买决定。
