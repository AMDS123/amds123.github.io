##### Abstract
Most of the temporal lobe epilepsy detection approaches are based on hippocampus deformation and use complicated features, resulting, detection is done with complicated features extraction and pre-processing task. In this paper, a new detection method based on shape-based features and spherical harmonics is proposed which can analysis the hippocampus shape anomaly and detection asymmetry. This method consisted of two main parts; (1) shape feature extraction, and (2) image classification. For evaluation, HFH database is used which is publicly available in this field. Nine different geometry and 256 spherical harmonic features are introduced then selected Eighteen of them that detect the asymmetry in hippocampus significantly in a randomly selected subset of the dataset. Then a support vector machine (SVM) classifier was employed to classify the remaining images of the dataset to normal and epileptic images using our selected features. On a dataset of 25 images, 12 images were used for feature extraction and the rest 13 for classification. The results show that the proposed method has accuracy, specificity and sensitivity of, respectively, 84%, 100%, and 80%. Therefore, the proposed approach shows acceptable result and is straightforward also; complicated pre-processing steps were omitted compared to other methods.

大多数颞叶癫痫的检测方法都是基于海马变形并使用复杂的特征，由此进行复杂的特征提取和预处理任务的检测。本文提出了一种基于形状特征和球谐函数的检测方法，可以分析海马形状异常和检测不对称性。这个方法由两个主要部分组成： （1）形状特征提取，和（2）图像分类。为了评估，使用在该领域公开可得的HFH数据库。引入了9种不同的几何和256个球谐函数，然后选择其中的18种，在随机选择的数据集子集中显着检测海马中的不对称性。然后，使用支持向量机（SVM）分类器来使用我们选择的特征将数据集的剩余图像分类为正常和癫痫图像。在25幅图像的数据集中，12幅图像用于特征提取，其余13幅用于分类。结果表明，该方法的准确性，特异性和灵敏度分别为84％，100％和80％。因此，所提出的方法显示出可以接受的结果，并且也是直接的;与其他方法相比，省略了复杂的预处理步骤。
