##### Abstract
In this paper, the concept of representation learning based on deep neural networks is applied as an alternative to the use of handcrafted features in a method for automatic visual inspection of corroded thermoelectric metallic pipes. A texture convolutional neural network (TCNN) replaces handcrafted features based on Local Phase Quantization (LPQ) and Haralick descriptors (HD) with the advantage of learning an appropriate textural representation and the decision boundaries into a single optimization process. Experimental results have shown that it is possible to reach the accuracy of 99.20% in the task of identifying different levels of corrosion in the internal surface of thermoelectric pipe walls, while using a compact network that requires much less effort in tuning parameters when compared to the handcrafted approach since the TCNN architecture is compact regarding the number of layers and connections. The observed results open up the possibility of using deep neural networks in real-time applications such as the automatic inspection of thermoelectric metal pipes.
