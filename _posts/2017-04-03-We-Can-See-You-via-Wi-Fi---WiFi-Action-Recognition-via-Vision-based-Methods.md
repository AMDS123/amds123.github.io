##### Abstract
Recently, Wi-Fi has caught tremendous attention for its ubiquity, and, motivated by Wi-Fi's low cost and privacy preservation, researchers have been putting lots of investigation into its potential on action recognition and even person identification. In this paper, we offer an comprehensive overview on these two topics in Wi-Fi. Also, through looking at these two topics from an unprecedented perspective, we could achieve generality instead of designing specific ad-hoc features for each scenario. Observing the great resemblance of Channel State Information (CSI, a fine-grained information captured from the received Wi-Fi signal) to texture, we proposed a brand-new framework based on computer vision methods. To minimize the effect of location dependency embedded in CSI, we propose a novel de-noising method based on Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) to eliminate the background energy and effectively extract the channel information of signals reflected by human bodies. From the experiments conducted, we demonstrate the feasibility and efficacy of the proposed methods. Also, we conclude factors that would affect the performance and highlight a few promising issues that require further deliberation.

近年来，Wi-Fi已经引起了人们极大的关注，而且由于Wi-Fi的低成本和隐私保护，研究人员对其在动作识别，甚至人身份识别方面的潜力进行了大量的研究。在本文中，我们将全面概述Wi-Fi中的这两个主题。而且，通过从前所未有的角度来看待这两个话题，我们可以实现通用性，而不是为每个场景设计特定的特定功能。观察到信道状态信息（CSI，从接收到的Wi-Fi信号中捕获的细粒度信息）与纹理极其相似，我们提出了一种基于计算机视觉方法的全新框架。为了最大限度地降低CSI中嵌入位置依赖性的影响，提出了一种基于奇异值分解（SVD）的去噪方法，消除背景能量，有效提取人体反射信号的信道信息。从所进行的实验中，我们证明了所提出方法的可行性和有效性。另外，我们总结了会影响绩效的因素，并强调一些有希望的问题，需要进一步的研究。
