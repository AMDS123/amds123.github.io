##### Abstract
The analysis of the practices and the tendencies of the users at the time of the search for information on Internet makes it possible to highlight several points. The search for information becomes powerful after knowledge of the typology of the various systems of research. This typology supports the adoption of a methodology of research which one can characterize by pull systems, intelligent agents, etc. In addition, the importance of the structure of the electronic document, correctly elaborated in advance, will support a higher relevance ratio to find information. In our article, the problems turn around the study of the behavior of the users in situation of search for information, as well as the constitution of a pole of documentary resources within a framework of an architectural project. It is noted that the evolution of the documentary resources is related to information technologies.
