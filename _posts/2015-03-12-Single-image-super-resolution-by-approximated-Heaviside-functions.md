##### Abstract
Image super-resolution is a process to enhance image resolution. It is widely used in medical imaging, satellite imaging, target recognition, etc. In this paper, we conduct continuous modeling and assume that the unknown image intensity function is defined on a continuous domain and belongs to a space with a redundant basis. We propose a new iterative model for single image super-resolution based on an observation: an image is consisted of smooth components and non-smooth components, and we use two classes of approximated Heaviside functions (AHFs) to represent them respectively. Due to sparsity of the non-smooth components, a $L_{1}$ model is employed. In addition, we apply the proposed iterative model to image patches to reduce computation and storage. Comparisons with some existing competitive methods show the effectiveness of the proposed method.

图像超分辨率是一个提高图像分辨率的过程。它被广泛应用于医学成像，卫星成像，目标识别等。本文进行连续建模，并假设未知图像强度函数是在连续域上定义的，属于冗余基础空间。基于观察，我们提出了一种新的单幅图像超分辨率迭代模型：图像由光滑分量和非光滑分量组成，我们分别用两类近似Heaviside函数（AHF）来表示它们。由于非光滑分量的稀疏性，采用$ L_ {1} $模型。另外，我们将所提出的迭代模型应用于图像补丁以减少计算和存储。与现有的一些竞争方法进行比较，表明了该方法的有效性。
