##### Abstract
We demonstrate the use of shape-from-shading (SfS) to improve both the quality and the robustness of 3D reconstruction of dynamic objects captured by a single camera. Unlike previous approaches that made use of SfS as a post-processing step, we offer a principled integrated approach that solves dynamic object tracking and reconstruction and SfS as a single unified cost function. Moving beyond Lambertian S f S , we propose a general approach that models both specularities and shading while simultaneously tracking and reconstructing general dynamic objects. Solving these problems jointly prevents the kinds of tracking failures which can not be recovered from by pipeline approaches. We show state-of-the-art results both qualitatively and quantitatively.

##### Abstract (translated by Google)
我们演示了使用阴影形状（SfS）来提高单个摄像机捕获的动态对象的三维重建的质量和鲁棒性。与以前使用SfS作为后处理步骤的方法不同，我们提供了一个原则性的集成方法，将动态目标跟踪和重建以及SfS作为一个统一的成本函数来解决。超越朗伯S f S，我们提出了一种通用的方法来模拟镜面反射和阴影，同时跟踪和重构一般的动态物体。共同解决这些问题，防止了通过管道方式无法恢复的各种跟踪失败。我们展示了定性和定量的最先进的结果。
