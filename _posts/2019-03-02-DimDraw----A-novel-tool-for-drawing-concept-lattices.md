##### Abstract
Concept lattice drawings are an important tool to visualize complex relations in data in a simple manner to human readers. Many attempts were made to transfer classical graph drawing approaches to order diagrams. Although those methods are satisfying for some lattices they unfortunately perform poorly in general. In this work we present a novel tool to draw concept lattices that is purely motivated by the order structure.
