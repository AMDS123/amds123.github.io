##### Abstract
Radiation therapy has emerged as one of the preferred techniques to treat brain cancer patients. During treatment, a very high dose of radiation is delivered to a very narrow area. Prescribed radiation therapy for brain cancer requires precisely defining the target treatment area, as well as delineating vital brain structures which must be spared from radiotoxicity. Nevertheless, delineation task is usually still manually performed, which is inefficient and operator-dependent. Several attempts of automatizing this process have reported. however, marginal results when analyzing organs in the optic region. In this work we present a deep learning classification scheme based on augmented-enhanced features to automatically segment organs at risk (OARs) in the optic region -optic nerves, optic chiasm, pituitary gland and pituitary stalk-. Fifteen MR images with various types of brain tumors were retrospectively collected to undergo manual and automatic segmentation. Mean Dice Similarity coefficients around 0.80 were reported. Incorporation of proposed features yielded to improvements on the segmentation. Compared with support vector machines, our method achieved better performance with less variation on the results, as well as a considerably reduction on the classification time. Performance of the proposed approach was also evaluated with respect to manual contours. In this case, results obtained from the automatic contours mostly lie on the variability of the observers, showing no significant differences with respect to them. These results suggest therefore that the proposed system is more accurate than other presented approaches, up to date, to segment these structures. The speed, reproducibility, and robustness of the process make the proposed deep learning-based classification system a valuable tool for assisting in the delineation task of small OARs in brain cancer.

放射治疗已成为治疗脑癌患者的首选技术之一。在治疗期间，非常高剂量的辐射被输送到非常狭窄的区域。规定的脑癌放射治疗需要精确定义目标治疗领域，以及划定重要的大脑结构，必须避免放射性毒性。尽管如此，划定任务通常仍然是手动执行的，这是低效的和依赖于操作员的。自动化这个过程的几次尝试都有报道。然而，在分析视觉区域中的器官时的边际结果。在这项工作中，我们提出了一种基于增强增强特征的深度学习分类方案，以自动分割视神经，视交叉，脑下垂体和垂体柄等视觉区域中的风险器官（OAR）。回顾性收集15例不同类型脑肿瘤的MR图像，进行手动和自动分割。平均骰子相似系数约为0.80。纳入建议的功能产生改善分割。与支持向量机相比，我们的方法实现了更好的性能，结果变化较小，分类时间大大缩短。所提出的方法的性能还被评估为关于手动轮廓。在这种情况下，从自动轮廓获得的结果主要取决于观察者的可变性，相对于它们没有显着差异。这些结果表明，所提出的系统比迄今为止所提出的其他方法更准确地分割这些结构。该过程的速度，重现性和鲁棒性使得所提出的深度学习型分类系统成为辅助小型OARs在脑癌中描绘任务的有价值的工具。
