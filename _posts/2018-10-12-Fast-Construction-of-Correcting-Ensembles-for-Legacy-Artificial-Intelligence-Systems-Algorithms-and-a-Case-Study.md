##### Abstract
This paper presents a technology for simple and computationally efficient improvements of a generic Artificial Intelligence (AI) system, including Multilayer and Deep Learning neural networks. The improvements are, in essence, small network ensembles constructed on top of the existing AI architectures. Theoretical foundations of the technology are based on Stochastic Separation Theorems and the ideas of the concentration of measure. We show that, subject to mild technical assumptions on statistical properties of internal signals in the original AI system, the technology enables instantaneous and computationally efficient removal of spurious and systematic errors with probability close to one on the datasets which are exponentially large in dimension. The method is illustrated with numerical examples and a case study of ten digits recognition from American Sign Language.
