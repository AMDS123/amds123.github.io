##### Abstract
We describe the SemEval task of extracting keyphrases and relations between them from scientific documents, which is crucial for understanding which publications describe which processes, tasks and materials. Although this was a new task, we had a total of 26 submissions across 3 evaluation scenarios. We expect the task and the findings reported in this paper to be relevant for researchers working on understanding scientific content, as well as the broader knowledge base population and information extraction communities.

我们描述了从科学文献中提取关键词及其关系的SemEval任务，这对于理解哪些出版物描述哪些过程，任务和材料是至关重要的。虽然这是一个新的任务，但我们在三个评估方案中总共提交了26个提交。我们期望本文中报告的任务和发现与研究科学内容的研究人员以及更广泛的知识库人群和信息提取社区相关。
