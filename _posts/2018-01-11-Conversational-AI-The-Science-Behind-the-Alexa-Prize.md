##### Abstract
Conversational agents are exploding in popularity. However, much work remains in the area of social conversation as well as free-form conversation over a broad range of domains and topics. To advance the state of the art in conversational AI, Amazon launched the Alexa Prize, a 2.5-million-dollar university competition where sixteen selected university teams were challenged to build conversational agents, known as socialbots, to converse coherently and engagingly with humans on popular topics such as Sports, Politics, Entertainment, Fashion and Technology for 20 minutes. The Alexa Prize offers the academic community a unique opportunity to perform research with a live system used by millions of users. The competition provided university teams with real user conversational data at scale, along with the user-provided ratings and feedback augmented with annotations by the Alexa team. This enabled teams to effectively iterate and make improvements throughout the competition while being evaluated in real-time through live user interactions. To build their socialbots, university teams combined state-of-the-art techniques with novel strategies in the areas of Natural Language Understanding, Context Modeling, Dialog Management, Response Generation, and Knowledge Acquisition. To support the efforts of participating teams, the Alexa Prize team made significant scientific and engineering investments to build and improve Conversational Speech Recognition, Topic Tracking, Dialog Evaluation, Voice User Experience, and tools for traffic management and scalability. This paper outlines the advances created by the university teams as well as the Alexa Prize team to achieve the common goal of solving the problem of Conversational AI.

##### Abstract (translated by Google)
会话代理正在迅速普及。然而，在社交谈话方面还有许多工作要做，而且在广泛的领域和主题上进行自由形式的谈话。为了提高对话AI的艺术水平，亚马逊推出了价值250万美元的大学竞赛 -  Alexa奖，在这个大学竞赛中，16个选定的大学队被挑战去建立一个叫做社交机器人的对话代理人，如体育，政治，娱乐，时尚和科技20分钟的议题。 Alexa Prize为学术界提供了一个独特的机会，用数百万用户使用的现场系统进行研究。比赛为大学团队提供了真实的用户会话数据，以及用户提供的评分和反馈，由Alexa团队进行注释。这使得团队能够在整个竞争中进行有效的迭代和改进，同时通过实时用户交互进行实时评估。为了构建自己的社交机器人，大学团队将自然语言理解，语境建模，对话管理，响应生成和知识获取等领域的最新技术与新颖的策略相结合。为了支持参与团队的努力，Alexa Prize团队进行了重大的科学和工程投资，以建立和改进会话语音识别，主题跟踪，对话评估，语音用户体验以及流量管理和可扩展性工具。本文概述了大学团队以及Alexa Prize团队所取得的进展，以达到解决会话AI问题的共同目标。
