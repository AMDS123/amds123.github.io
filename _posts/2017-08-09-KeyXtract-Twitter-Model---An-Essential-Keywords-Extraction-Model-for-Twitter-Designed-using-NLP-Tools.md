##### Abstract
Since a tweet is limited to 140 characters, it is ambiguous and difficult for traditional Natural Language Processing (NLP) tools to analyse. This research presents KeyXtract which enhances the machine learning based Stanford CoreNLP Part-of-Speech (POS) tagger with the Twitter model to extract essential keywords from a tweet. The system was developed using rule-based parsers and two corpora. The data for the research was obtained from a Twitter profile of a telecommunication company. The system development consisted of two stages. At the initial stage, a domain specific corpus was compiled after analysing the tweets. The POS tagger extracted the Noun Phrases and Verb Phrases while the parsers removed noise and extracted any other keywords missed by the POS tagger. The system was evaluated using the Turing Test. After it was tested and compared against Stanford CoreNLP, the second stage of the system was developed addressing the shortcomings of the first stage. It was enhanced using Named Entity Recognition and Lemmatization. The second stage was also tested using the Turing test and its pass rate increased from 50.00% to 83.33%. The performance of the final system output was measured using the F1 score. Stanford CoreNLP with the Twitter model had an average F1 of 0.69 while the improved system had a F1 of 0.77. The accuracy of the system could be improved by using a complete domain specific corpus. Since the system used linguistic features of a sentence, it could be applied to other NLP tools.

由于推特被限制为140个字符，因此传统的自然语言处理（NLP）工具难以分析和模糊。这项研究提出了KeyXtract，它增强了基于斯坦福CoreNLP词性（POS）标记的机器学习与Twitter模型，从推文中提取重要的关键字。该系统是使用基于规则的解析器和两个语料库开发的。研究数据是从电信公司的Twitter个人资料中获得的。系统开发包括两个阶段。在初始阶段，通过分析推文，编写了一个领域特定的语料库。 POS标注器提取名词短语和动词短语，而解析器则去除噪音并提取由POS标记器遗漏的任何其他关键字。该系统使用图灵测试进行评估。经过测试并与斯坦福CoreNLP进行比较后，系统的第二阶段是针对第一阶段的缺点而开发的。它使用命名实体识别和词形化进行了增强。第二阶段也使用图灵测试进行测试，合格率从50.00％上升到83.33％。最终系统输出的性能使用F1得分进行测量。带有Twitter模型的斯坦福CoreNLP的平均F1为0.69，而改进后的系统的F1为0.77。系统的准确性可以通过使用一个完整的领域特定的语料库来改善。由于该系统使用了句子的语言特征，因此可以应用于其他NLP工具。
