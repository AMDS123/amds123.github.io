##### Abstract
Swarm control is a difficult problem due to the need to guide a large number of agents simultaneously. We cast the problem as a shepherding problem, similar to biological dogs guiding a group of sheep towards a goal. The shepherd needs to deal with complex and dynamic environments and make decisions in order to direct the swarm from one location to another. In this paper, we design a novel curriculum to teach an artificial intelligence empowered agent to shepherd in the presence of the large state space associated with the shepherding problem and in a transparent manner. The results show that a properly designed curriculum could indeed enhance the speed of learning and the complexity of learnt behaviours.
