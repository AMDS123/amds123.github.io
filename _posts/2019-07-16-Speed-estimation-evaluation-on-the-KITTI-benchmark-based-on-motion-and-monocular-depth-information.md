##### Abstract
In this technical report we investigate speed estimation of the ego-vehicle on the KITTI benchmark using state-of-the-art deep neural network based optical flow and single-view depth prediction methods. Using a straightforward intuitive approach and approximating a single scale factor, we evaluate several application schemes of the deep networks and formulate meaningful conclusions such as: combining depth information with optical flow improves speed estimation accuracy as opposed to using optical flow alone; the quality of the deep neural network methods influences speed estimation performance; using the depth and optical flow results from smaller crops of wide images degrades performance. With these observations in mind, we achieve a RMSE of less than 1 m/s for vehicle speed estimation using monocular images as input from recordings of the KITTI benchmark. Limitations and possible future directions are discussed as well.
