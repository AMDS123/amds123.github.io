##### Abstract
All existing image enhancement methods, such as HDR tone mapping, cannot recover A/D quantization losses due to insufficient or excessive lighting, (underflow and overflow problems). The loss of image details due to A/D quantization is complete and it cannot be recovered by traditional image processing methods, but the modern data-driven machine learning approach offers a much needed cure to the problem. In this work we propose a novel approach to restore and enhance images acquired in low and uneven lighting. First, the ill illumination is algorithmically compensated by emulating the effects of artificial supplementary lighting. Then a DCNN trained using only synthetic data recovers the missing detail caused by quantization.

所有现有的图像增强方法（如HDR色调映射）都无法恢复由于光照不足或过多（下溢和溢出问题）导致的A / D量化损失。由于A / D量化造成的图像细节丢失是完整的，并且传统图像处理方法无法恢复，但现代数据驱动的机器学习方法提供了急需解决的问题。在这项工作中，我们提出了一种新颖的方法来恢复和增强低照度和不均匀照明中获取的图像。首先，通过仿真人工辅助照明的效果来对照度进行算法补偿。然后，仅使用合成数据训练的DCNN恢复由量化引起的遗漏细节。
