##### Abstract
Automatic recognition of spontaneous facial expressions is a major challenge in the field of affective computing. Head rotation, face pose, illumination variation, occlusion etc. are the attributes that increase the complexity of recognition of spontaneous expressions in practical applications. Effective recognition of expressions depends significantly on the quality of the database used. Most well-known facial expression databases consist of posed expressions. However, currently there is a huge demand for spontaneous expression databases for the pragmatic implementation of the facial expression recognition algorithms. In this paper, we propose and establish a new facial expression database containing spontaneous expressions of both male and female participants of Indian origin. The database consists of 428 segmented video clips of the spontaneous facial expressions of 50 participants. In our experiment, emotions were induced among the participants by using emotional videos and simultaneously their self-ratings were collected for each experienced emotion. Facial expression clips were annotated carefully by four trained decoders, which were further validated by the nature of stimuli used and self-report of emotions. An extensive analysis was carried out on the database using several machine learning algorithms and the results are provided for future reference. Such a spontaneous database will help in the development and validation of algorithms for recognition of spontaneous expressions.

自动表情的自动识别是情感计算领域的主要挑战。头部旋转，人脸姿态，光照变化，遮挡等是在实际应用中增加自发表达的识别复杂度的属性。对表达的有效识别在很大程度上取决于所用数据库的质量。大多数着名的面部表情数据库由构成的表情组成。然而，目前对面部表情识别算法的实用化实现需要自发的表情数据库。在本文中，我们提出并建立一个新的面部表情数据库，其中包含印度裔男性和女性参与者的自发表达。该数据库由42个参与者的自发面部表情的428个分段视频剪辑组成。在我们的实验中，通过使用情绪视频诱发参与者之间的情绪，同时为每个有经验的情绪收集他们的自我评价。四个训练有素的解码器仔细注释了面部表情剪辑，这些解码器通过所使用的刺激的性质和情绪的自我报告进一步验证。使用几种机器学习算法对数据库进行了广泛的分析，并将结果提供给将来参考。这样一个自发的数据库将有助于开发和验证自发表达式的识别算法。
