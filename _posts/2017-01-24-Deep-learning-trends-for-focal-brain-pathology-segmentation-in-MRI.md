##### Abstract
Segmentation of focal (localized) brain pathologies such as brain tumors and brain lesions caused by multiple sclerosis and ischemic strokes are necessary for medical diagnosis, surgical planning and disease development as well as other applications such as tractography. Over the years, attempts have been made to automate this process for both clinical and research reasons. In this regard, machine learning methods have long been a focus of attention. Over the past two years, the medical imaging field has seen a rise in the use of a particular branch of machine learning commonly known as deep learning. In the non-medical computer vision world, deep learning based methods have obtained state-of-the-art results on many datasets. Recent studies in computer aided diagnostics have shown deep learning methods (and especially convolutional neural networks - CNN) to yield promising results. In this chapter, we provide a survey of CNN methods applied to medical imaging with a focus on brain pathology segmentation. In particular, we discuss their characteristic peculiarities and their specific configuration and adjustments that are best suited to segment medical images. We also underline the intrinsic differences deep learning methods have with other machine learning methods.

##### Abstract (translated by Google)
对于医学诊断，手术规划和疾病发展以及诸如纤维束成像的其他应用，需要对局部（局部）脑病理进行分割，例如由多发性硬化和缺血性中风引起的脑肿瘤和脑损伤。多年来，为了临床和研究的原因，已经尝试使这个过程自动化。在这方面，机器学习方法一直是人们关注的焦点。在过去的两年里，医学影像领域在使用机器学习的一个特定领域，即通常所说的深度学习方面出现了上升。在非医学计算机视觉世界中，基于深度学习的方法已经在许多数据集上获得了最新的结果。最近在计算机辅助诊断方面的研究已经显示了深刻的学习方法（尤其是卷积神经网络--CNN），以产生有希望的结果。在本章中，我们提供了一个应用于医学成像CNN方法的调查，重点是脑病理分割。我们特别讨论了他们特有的特点，以及最适合细分医学影像的具体配置和调整。我们还强调了深度学习方法与其他机器学习方法的内在差异。
