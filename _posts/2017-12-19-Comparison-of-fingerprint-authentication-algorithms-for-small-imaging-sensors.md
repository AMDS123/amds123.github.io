##### Abstract
The demand for biometric systems has been increasing with the growth of the smartphone market. Biometric devices allow the user to authenticate easily while securing its private data without the need to remember any access code. Amongst them, fingerprint sensors are the most widespread because they seem to provide a good balance between reliability, cost and ease of use. According to smartphone manufacturers, the security level is guaranteed to be high. However, the size of those sensors, which is only a few millimeters squared, prevents the use of minutiae algorithms. To the best of our knowledge, very few studies shed light onto this problem, though many pattern recognition algorithms already exist as well as commercial solutions which are supposedly robust. In this article we try to provide insights on how to tackle this problem by analyzing the performance of three algorithms dedicated to pattern recognition.

##### Abstract (translated by Google)
随着智能手机市场的增长，对生物识别系统的需求也在不断增加。生物识别设备允许用户容易地进行认证，同时保护其私人数据，而不需要记住任何访问代码。其中，指纹传感器是最广泛的，因为它们似乎提供了可靠性，成本和易用性之间的良好平衡。据智能手机厂商介绍，安全级别保证很高。然而，这些只有几毫米平方的传感器的尺寸妨碍了细节算法的使用。就我们所知，尽管有许多模式识别算法已经存在以及据说功能强大的商业解决方案，但是很少有研究能够解决这个问题。在本文中，我们尝试通过分析三种专用于模式识别的算法的性能来提供有关如何解决此问题的见解。
