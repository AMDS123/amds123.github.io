##### Abstract
In Biometric identification, fingerprints based identification has been the widely accepted mechanism. Automated fingerprints identification/verification techniques are widely adopted in many civilian and forensic applications. In forensic applications fingerprints are usually incomplete, broken, unclear or degraded which are known as partial fingerprints. Fingerprints identification/verification largely suffer from the problem of handling partial fingerprints. In this paper a novel and simple approach is presented for detecting partial fingerprints using core point location. Our techniques is particularly useful during the acquisition stage as to determine whether a user needs to re-align the finger to ensure a complete capture of fingerprint area.This technique is tested on FVC-2002 DB1A. The results are very accurate which are presented in the Results sections.
