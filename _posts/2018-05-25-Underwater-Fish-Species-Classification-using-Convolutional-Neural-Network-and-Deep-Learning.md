##### Abstract
The target of this paper is to recommend a way for Automated classification of Fish species. A high accuracy fish classification is required for greater understanding of fish behavior in Ichthyology and by marine biologists. Maintaining a ledger of the number of fishes per species and marking the endangered species in large and small water bodies is required by concerned institutions. Majority of available methods focus on classification of fishes outside of water because underwater classification poses challenges such as background noises, distortion of images, the presence of other water bodies in images, image quality and occlusion. This method uses a novel technique based on Convolutional Neural Networks, Deep Learning and Image Processing to achieve an accuracy of 96.29%. This method ensures considerably discrimination accuracy improvements than the previously proposed methods.

本文的目标是为鱼类物种的自动分类提供一种方法。为了更好地了解鱼类学和海洋生物学家的鱼类行为，需要高精度的鱼类分类。有关机构要求每个物种的鱼类数量保持一个分类，并在大小水域中标记濒危物种。大多数可用的方法都集中在水下的鱼类分类上，因为水下分类会带来诸如背景噪声，图像失真，图像中其他水体的存在，图像质量和遮挡等挑战。该方法使用基于卷积神经网络，深度学习和图像处理的新技术来实现96.29％的准确度。与先前提出的方法相比，该方法确保了显着的鉴别准确性改进
