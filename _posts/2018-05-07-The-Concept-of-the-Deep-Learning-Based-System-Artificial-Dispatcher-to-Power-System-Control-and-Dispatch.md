##### Abstract
Year by year control of normal and emergency conditions of up-to-date power systems becomes an increasingly complicated problem. With the increasing complexity the existing control system of power system conditions which includes operative actions of the dispatcher and work of special automatic devices proves to be insufficiently effective more and more frequently, which raises risks of dangerous and emergency conditions in power systems. The paper is aimed at compensating for the shortcomings of man (a cognitive barrier, exposure to stresses and so on) and automatic devices by combining their strong points, i.e. the dispatcher's intelligence and the speed of automatic devices by virtue of development of the intelligent system "Artificial dispatcher" on the basis of deep machine learning technology. For realization of the system "Artificial dispatcher" in addition to deep learning it is planned to attract the game theory approaches to formalize work of the up-to-date power system as a game problem. The "gain" for "Artificial dispatcher" will consist in bringing in a power system in the normal steady-state or post-emergency conditions by means of the required control actions.

逐年控制最新电力系统的正常和紧急情况成为越来越复杂的问题。随着电力系统状况的现有控制系统越来越复杂，包括调度员的操作行为和特殊自动装置的工作证明效率越来越低，这提供了电力系统中的危险和紧急情况的风险。本文旨在通过智能系统的发展，结合自己的优点，即调度员的智能和自动装置的速度，弥补人的缺点（认知障碍，暴露于压力等）和自动装置基于深度机器学习技术的“人工调度员”。为了实现“人工调度员”系统除深度学习外，计划吸引游戏理论方法，将最新的电力系统的工作形式化为游戏问题。 “人工调度员”的“收益”将包括通过所需的控制措施引入正常稳态或紧急情况后的电力系统。
