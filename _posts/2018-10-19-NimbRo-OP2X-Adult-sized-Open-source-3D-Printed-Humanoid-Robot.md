##### Abstract
Humanoid robotics research depends on capable robot platforms, but recently developed advanced platforms are often not available to other research groups, expensive, dangerous to operate, or closed-source. The lack of available platforms forces researchers to work with smaller robots, which have less strict dynamic constraints or with simulations, which lack many real-world effects. We developed NimbRo-OP2X to address this need. At a height of 135 cm our robot is large enough to interact in a human environment. Its low weight of only 19 kg makes the operation of the robot safe and easy, as no special operational equipment is necessary. Our robot is equipped with a fast onboard computer and a GPU to accelerate parallel computations. We extend our already open-source software by a deep-learning based vision system and gait parameter optimisation. The NimbRo-OP2X was evaluated during RoboCup 2018 in Montr\'eal, Canada, where it won all possible awards in the Humanoid AdultSize class.
