##### Abstract
Natural-language-facilitated human-robot cooperation (NLC), in which natural language (NL) is used to share knowledge between a human and a robot for conducting intuitive human-robot cooperation (HRC), is continuously developing in the recent decade. Currently, NLC is used in several robotic domains such as manufacturing, daily assistance and health caregiving. It is necessary to summarize current NLC-based robotic systems and discuss the future developing trends, providing helpful information for future NLC research. In this review, we first analyzed the driving forces behind the NLC research. Regarding to a robot s cognition level during the cooperation, the NLC implementations then were categorized into four types {NL-based control, NL-based robot training, NL-based task execution, NL-based social companion} for comparison and discussion. Last based on our perspective and comprehensive paper review, the future research trends were discussed.

##### Abstract (translated by Google)
在自然语言（NL）被用来在人与机器人之间分享知识以进行直观的人机合作（HRC）的自然语言促进的人机合作（NLC）在近十年中不断发展。目前，NLC被用于多个机器人领域，如制造业，日常援助和医疗保健。有必要总结目前基于NLC的机器人系统并讨论未来的发展趋势，为未来的NLC研究提供有用的信息。在这篇综述中，我们首先分析了NLC研究的驱动力。对于机器人在合作过程中的认知水平，将NLC实现分为{NL控制，NL机器人训练，NL任务执行，NL基于社会伙伴}进行比较和讨论。最后根据我们的观点和综合论文的回顾，讨论了未来的研究趋势。
