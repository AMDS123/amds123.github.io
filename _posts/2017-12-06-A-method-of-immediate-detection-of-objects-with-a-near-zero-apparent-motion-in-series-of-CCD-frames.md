##### Abstract
The paper deals with a computational method for detection of the solar system minor bodies (SSOs), whose inter-frame shifts in series of CCD-frames during the observation are commensurate with the errors in measuring their positions. These objects have velocities of apparent motion between CCD-frames not exceeding three RMS errors ($3\sigma$) of measurements of their positions. About 15\% of objects have a near-zero apparent motion in CCD-frames, including the objects beyond the Jupiter's orbit as well as the asteroids heading straight to the Earth. The proposed method for detection of the object's near-zero apparent motion in series of CCD-frames is based on the Fisher f-criterion instead of using the traditional decision rules that are based on the maximum likelihood criterion. We analyzed the quality indicators of detection of the object's near-zero apparent motion applying statistical and in situ modeling techniques in terms of the conditional probability of the true detection of objects with a near-zero apparent motion. The efficiency of method being implemented as a plugin for the Collection Light Technology (CoLiTec) software for automated asteroids and comets detection has been demonstrated. Among the objects discovered with this plugin, there was the sungrazing comet C/2012 S1 (ISON). Within 26 minutes of the observation, the comet's image has been moved by three pixels in a series of four CCD-frames (the velocity of its apparent motion at the moment of discovery was equal to 0.8 pixels per CCD-frame; the image size on the frame was about five pixels). Next verification in observations of asteroids with a near-zero apparent motion conducted with small telescopes has confirmed an efficiency of the method even in bad conditions (strong backlight from the full Moon). So, we recommend applying the proposed method for series of observations with four or more frames.

本文介绍了一种检测太阳系次体（SSOs）的计算方法，在观测过程中CCD帧的一系列帧间偏移与测量位置误差相当。这些物体在CCD帧之间的视在运动速度不超过其位置测量值的三个RMS误差（$ 3 \ sigma $）。大约15％的物体在CCD帧中有接近于零的明显运动，包括木星轨道以外的物体以及直接向地球飞行的小行星。所提出的在一系列CCD帧中检测物体的近似零视在运动的方法是基于费舍尔f-准则而不是使用基于最大似然准则的传统决策规则。我们分析了检测对象的近零视在运动的质量指标，应用统计和原位建模技术，以真实检测具有接近零视在运动的对象的条件概率。已经证明了作为用于自动化小行星和彗星检测的收集光技术（CoLiTec）软件的插件实现的方法的效率。在这个插件发现的对象中，有一颗彗星C / 2012 S1（ISON）。在观测的26分钟内，彗星的图像在一系列四个CCD帧中被移动了三个像素（在发现时它的视在运动的速度等于每个CCD帧的0.8个像素;图像尺寸在该框架大约五个像素）。下一次用小望远镜观测小行星的近似零视野运动的验证证实，即使在恶劣的条件下（从满月的强背光），该方法也是有效的。所以，我们建议将这个方法用于一系列具有四帧或更多帧的观测。
