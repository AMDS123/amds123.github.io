##### Abstract
Sequence-to-sequence (Seq2Seq) models with attention have excelled at tasks which involve generating natural language sentences such as machine translation, image captioning and speech recognition. Performance has further been improved by leveraging unlabeled data, often in the form of a language model. In this work, we present the Cold Fusion method, which leverages a pre-trained language model during training, and show its effectiveness on the speech recognition task. We show that Seq2Seq models with Cold Fusion are able to better utilize language information enjoying i) faster convergence and better generalization, and ii) almost complete transfer to a new domain while using less than 10% of the labeled training data.

具有注意力的序列到序列（Seq2Seq）模型在涉及生成自然语言句子（例如机器翻译，图像字幕和语音识别）的任务方面表现优异。通过利用未标记的数据（通常以语言模型的形式）来进一步提高性能。在这项工作中，我们提出了Cold Fusion方法，该方法在训练期间利用预训练的语言模型，并在语音识别任务中显示其有效性。我们展示了具有Cold Fusion的Seq2Seq模型能够更好地利用语言信息，i）更快的收敛和更好的泛化，以及ii）几乎完全转移到新域，同时使用少于10％的标记训练数据。
