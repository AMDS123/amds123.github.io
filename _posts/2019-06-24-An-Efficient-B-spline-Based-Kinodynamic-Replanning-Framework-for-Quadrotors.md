##### Abstract
Trajectory replanning for quadrotors is essential to enable fully autonomous flight in unknown environments. Hierarchical motion planning frameworks, which combine path planning with path parameterization, are popular due to their time efficiency. However, the path planning cannot properly deal with non-static initial states of the quadrotor, which may result in non-smooth or even dynamically infeasible trajectories. In this paper, we present an efficient kinodynamic replanning framework by exploiting the advantageous properties of the B-spline, which facilitates dealing with the non-static state and guarantees safety and dynamical feasibility. Our framework starts with an efficient B-spline-based kinodynamic (EBK) search algorithm which finds a feasible trajectory with minimum control effort and time. To compensate for the discretization induced by the EBK search, an elastic optimization (EO) approach is proposed to refine the control point placement to the optimal location. Systematic comparisons against the state-of-the-art are conducted to validate the performance. Comprehensive onboard experiments using two different vision-based quadrotors are carried out showing the general applicability of the framework.
