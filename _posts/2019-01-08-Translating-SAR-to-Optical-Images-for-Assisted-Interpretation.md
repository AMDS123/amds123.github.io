##### Abstract
Despite the advantages of all-weather and all-day high-resolution imaging, SAR remote sensing images are much less viewed and used by general people because human vision is not adapted to microwave scattering phenomenon. However, expert interpreters can be trained by compare side-by-side SAR and optical images to learn the translation rules from SAR to optical. This paper attempts to develop machine intelligence that are trainable with large-volume co-registered SAR and optical images to translate SAR image to optical version for assisted SAR interpretation. A novel reciprocal GAN scheme is proposed for this translation task. It is trained and tested on both spaceborne GF-3 and airborne UAVSAR images. Comparisons and analyses are presented for datasets of different resolutions and polarizations. Results show that the proposed translation network works well under many scenarios and it could potentially be used for assisted SAR interpretation.
