##### Abstract
Deep artificial neural networks have made remarkable progress in different tasks in the field of computer vision. However, the empirical analysis of these models and investigation of their failure cases has received attention recently. In this work, we show that deep learning models cannot generalize to atypical images that are substantially different from training images. This is in contrast to the superior generalization ability of the visual system in the human brain. We focus on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) as the state-of-the-art models in object recognition and classification; investigate this problem in more detail, and hypothesize that training CNN models suffer from unstructured loss minimization. We propose computational models to improve the generalization capacity of CNNs by considering how typical a training image looks like. By conducting an extensive set of experiments we show that involving a typicality measure can improve the classification results on a new set of images by a large margin. More importantly, this significant improvement is achieved without fine-tuning the CNN model on the target image set.

深度人工神经网络在计算机视觉领域的不同任务中取得了显着的进步。然而，这些模型的实证分析及其失败案例的调查近来备受关注。在这项工作中，我们表明，深层次的学习模式不能推广到与训练图像大不相同的非典型图像。这与人脑中视觉系统的优越泛化能力相反。我们专注于卷积神经网络（CNN）作为目标识别和分类的最新模型;更详细地研究这个问题，并假设训练CNN模型遭受非结构化损失最小化。我们提出计算模型，通过考虑典型的训练图像的样子来提高CNN的泛化能力。通过进行一系列广泛的实验，我们发现涉及典型性度量可以大幅提高新图像的分类结果。更重要的是，这种显着的改进是在不对目标图像集上的CNN模型进行微调的情况下实现的。
