##### Abstract
Age and gender are complementary soft biometric traits for face recognition. Successful estimation of age and gender from facial images taken under real-world conditions can contribute improving the identification results in the wild. In this study, in order to achieve robust age and gender classification in the wild, we have benefited from Deep Convolutional Neural Networks based representation. We have explored transferability of existing deep convolutional neural network (CNN) models for age and gender classification. The generic AlexNet-like architecture and domain specific VGG-Face CNN model are employed and fine-tuned with the Adience dataset prepared for age and gender classification in uncontrolled environments. In addition, task specific GilNet CNN model has also been utilized and used as a baseline method in order to compare with transferred models. Experimental results show that both transferred deep CNN models outperform the GilNet CNN model, which is the state-of-the-art age and gender classification approach on the Adience dataset, by an absolute increase of 7% and 4.5% in accuracy, respectively. This outcome indicates that transferring a deep CNN model can provide better classification performance than a task specific CNN model, which has a limited number of layers and trained from scratch using a limited amount of data as in the case of GilNet. Domain specific VGG-Face CNN model has been found to be more useful and provided better performance for both age and gender classification tasks, when compared with generic AlexNet-like model, which shows that transfering from a closer domain is more useful.

年龄和性别是人脸识别的补充软生物特征。通过在真实世界中拍摄的面部图像对年龄和性别进行成功的估计可以有助于改善野外的鉴定结果。在这项研究中，为了在野外实现健壮的年龄和性别分类，我们从深度卷积神经网络的表示中受益。我们已经探索了现有的深度卷积神经网络（CNN）模型的年龄和性别分类的可转移性。采用通用的AlexNet类架构和领域特定的VGG-Face CNN模型，并在未受控制的环境中针对年龄和性别分类准备的Adience数据集进行微调。此外，任务特定的GilNet CNN模型也被用来作为基线方法，以便与传输模型进行比较。实验结果表明，转移的深层CNN模型的表现优于GilNet CNN模型，该模型是Adience数据集中最先进的年龄和性别分类方法，精度分别提高了7％和4.5％。这个结果表明，转移一个深度的CNN模型可以提供比任务特定的CNN模型更好的分类性能，这个模型的层数有限，并且像GilNet一样使用有限的数据从头开始训练。与通用的AlexNet-like模型相比，领域特定的VGG-FaceCNN模型被发现更有用并且为年龄和性别分类任务提供更好的性能，这表明从更近的域转移更有用。
