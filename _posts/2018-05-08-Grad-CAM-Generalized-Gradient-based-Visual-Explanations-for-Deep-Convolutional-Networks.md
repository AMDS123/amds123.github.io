##### Abstract
Over the last decade, Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models have been highly successful in solving complex vision based problems. However, these deep models are perceived as "black box" methods considering the lack of understanding of their internal functioning. There has been a significant recent interest to develop explainable deep learning models, and this paper is an effort in this direction. Building on a recently proposed method called Grad-CAM, we propose a generalized method called Grad-CAM++ that can provide better visual explanations of CNN model predictions, in terms of better object localization as well as explaining occurrences of multiple object instances in a single image, when compared to state-of-the-art. We provide a mathematical derivation for the proposed method, which uses a weighted combination of the positive partial derivatives of the last convolutional layer feature maps with respect to a specific class score as weights to generate a visual explanation for the corresponding class label. Our extensive experiments and evaluations, both subjective and objective, on standard datasets showed that Grad-CAM++ provides promising human-interpretable visual explanations for a given CNN architecture across multiple tasks including classification, image caption generation and 3D action recognition; as well as in new settings such as knowledge distillation.

在过去十年中，卷积神经网络（CNN）模型在解决基于复杂视觉的问题方面非常成功。然而，考虑到对其内部功能缺乏了解，这些深层模型被视为“黑盒子”方法。最近有兴趣开发可解释的深度学习模型，本文是朝着这个方向努力的。在最近提出的一种名为Grad-CAM的方法的基础上，我们提出了一种称为Grad-CAM ++的通用方法，它可以提供更好的CNN模型预测的视觉解释，更好的对象定位以及解释单个图像中多个对象实例的出现，与最先进的技术相比。我们为所提出的方法提供数学推导，其使用最后卷积层特征图的正偏导数相对于特定类分数的加权组合作为权重来生成对应类标签的视觉解释。我们对标准数据集的主观和客观的广泛实验和评估表明，Grad-CAM ++为多个任务（包括分类，图像标题生成和3D动作识别）的给定CNN架构提供了有前途的人类可解释的视觉解释。以及知识蒸馏等新环境。
