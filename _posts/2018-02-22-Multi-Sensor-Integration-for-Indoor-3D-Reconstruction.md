##### Abstract
Outdoor maps and navigation information delivered by modern services and technologies like Google Maps and Garmin navigators have revolutionized the lifestyle of many people. Motivated by the desire for similar navigation systems for indoor usage from consumers, advertisers, emergency rescuers/responders, etc., many indoor environments such as shopping malls, museums, casinos, airports, transit stations, offices, and schools need to be mapped. Typically, the environment is first reconstructed by capturing many point clouds from various stations and defining their spatial relationships. Currently, there is a lack of an accurate, rigorous, and speedy method for relating point clouds in indoor, urban, satellite-denied environments. This thesis presents a novel and automatic way for fusing calibrated point clouds obtained using a terrestrial laser scanner and the Microsoft Kinect by integrating them with a low-cost inertial measurement unit. The developed system, titled the Scannect, is the first joint static-kinematic indoor 3D mapper.

##### Abstract (translated by Google)
现代服务和技术（如Google Maps和Garmin导航器）提供的户外地图和导航信息彻底改变了许多人的生活方式。为了满足消费者，广告商，紧急救援人员/应急人员等对室内使用类似导航系统的需求，许多室内环境如商场，博物馆，赌场，机场，中转站，办公室和学校都需要进行映射。通常情况下，首先通过捕捉来自不同站点的许多点云并定义它们的空间关系来重建环境。目前，在室内，城市，卫星拒绝环境中缺乏准确，严格和快速的方法来关联点云。本文提出了一种新颖且自动的方法，用于将使用地面激光扫描仪和Microsoft Kinect获得的校准点云与低成本惯性测量单元相集成。这个名为Scannect的开发系统是第一个联合静态运动学室内3D绘图仪。
