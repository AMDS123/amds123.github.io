##### Abstract
Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy (MRS) provides valuable information to help with the identification and understanding of brain tumors, yet MRS is not a widely available medical imaging modality. Aiming to counter this issue, this research draws on the advancements in machine learning techniques in other fields for the generation of artificial data. The generated methods were tested through the evaluation of their output against that of a real-world labelled MRS brain tumor data-set. Furthermore the resultant output from the generative techniques were each used to train separate traditional classifiers which were tested on a subset of the real MRS brain tumor dataset. The results suggest that there exist methods capable of producing accurate, ground truth based MRS voxels. These findings indicate that through generative techniques, large datasets can be made available for training deep, learning models for the use in brain tumor diagnosis.

磁共振波谱（MRS）提供有价值的信息，以帮助识别和理解脑肿瘤，但MRS不是广泛可用的医学成像模式。为了解决这个问题，本研究借鉴了其他领域的机器学习技术在人工数据生成方面的进步。生成的方法通过评估其输出与真实标记的MRS脑肿瘤数据集的输出进行测试。此外，来自生成技术的结果输出每个用于训练单独的传统分类器，其在真实MRS脑肿瘤数据集的子集上进行测试。结果表明存在能够产生精确的基于地面实况的MRS体素的方法。这些研究结果表明，通过生成技术，可以提供大型数据集用于深度训练，用于脑肿瘤诊断的学习模型。
