##### Abstract
Objective: Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related death worldwide. Computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) systems have shown significant promise in recent years for facilitating the effective detection and classification of abnormal lung nodules in computed tomography (CT) scans. While hand-engineered radiomic features have been traditionally used for lung cancer prediction, there have been significant recent successes achieving state-of-the-art results in the area of discovery radiomics. Here, radiomic sequencers comprising of highly discriminative radiomic features are discovered directly from archival medical data. However, the interpretation of predictions made using such radiomic sequencers remains a challenge. Method: A novel end-to-end interpretable discovery radiomics-driven lung cancer prediction pipeline has been designed, build, and tested. The radiomic sequencer being discovered possesses a deep architecture comprised of stacked interpretable sequencing cells (SISC). Results: The SISC architecture is shown to outperform previous approaches while providing more insight in to its decision making process. Conclusion: The SISC radiomic sequencer is able to achieve state-of-the-art results in lung cancer prediction, and also offers prediction interpretability in the form of critical response maps. Significance: The critical response maps are useful for not only validating the predictions of the proposed SISC radiomic sequencer, but also provide improved radiologist-machine collaboration for effective diagnosis.
