##### Abstract
We address the problem of camera-to-laser-scanner calibration using a checkerboard and multiple image-laser scan pairs. Distinguishing which laser points measure the checkerboard and which lie on the background is essential to any such system. We formulate the checkerboard extraction as a combinatorial optimization problem with a clear cut objective function. We propose a branch-and-bound technique that deterministically and globally optimizes the objective. Unlike what is available in the literature, the proposed method is not heuristic and does not require assumptions such as constraints on the background or relying on discontinuity of the range measurements to partition the data into line segments. The proposed approach is generic and can be applied to both 3D or 2D laser scanners as well as the cases where multiple checkerboards are present. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach by providing numerical simulations as well as experimental results.

##### Abstract (translated by Google)
我们使用棋盘和多个图像激光扫描对来解决照相机到激光扫描仪的校准问题。区分哪些激光点测量棋盘格，哪些位于背景上对于任何这样的系统都是必不可少的。我们将棋盘提取制定为具有明确目标函数的组合优化问题。我们提出了一种确定性的和全球性的优化目标的分支定界技术。与文献中提供的不同，所提出的方法不是启发式的，并且不需要诸如背景上的约束的假设或依赖于距离测量的不连续性将数据划分成线段。所提出的方法是通用的，并且可以应用于3D或2D激光扫描仪以及存在多个棋盘格的情况。我们通过提供数值模拟和实验结果来证明所提出方法的有效性。
