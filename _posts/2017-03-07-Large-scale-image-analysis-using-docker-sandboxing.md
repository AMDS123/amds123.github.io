##### Abstract
With the advent of specialized hardware such as Graphics Processing Units (GPUs), large scale image localization, classification and retrieval have seen increased prevalence. Designing scalable software architecture that co-evolves with such specialized hardware is a challenge in the commercial setting. In this paper, we describe one such architecture (\textit{Cortexica}) that leverages scalability of GPUs and sandboxing offered by docker containers. This allows for the flexibility of mixing different computer architectures as well as computational algorithms with the security of a trusted environment. We illustrate the utility of this framework in a commercial setting i.e., searching for multiple products in an image by combining image localisation and retrieval.

随着图形处理单元（GPU）等专用硬件的出现，大规模图像定位，分类和检索的普及率也在不断增加。设计与这种专用硬件协同发展的可扩展软件架构在商业环境中是一个挑战。在本文中，我们描述了一个这样的架构（\ textit {Cortexica}），它利用GPU的可扩展性和docker容器提供的沙箱。这允许混合不同计算机体系结构的灵活性以及计算算法与可信环境的安全性。我们说明了这个框架在商业环境中的实用性，即通过结合图像定位和检索来在图像中搜索多个产品。
