##### Abstract
The FM-index is a celebrated compressed data structure for full-text pattern searching. After the first wave of interest in its theoretical developments, we can observe a surge of interest in practical FM-index variants in the last few years. These enhancements are often related to a bit-vector representation, augmented with an efficient rank-handling data structure. In this work, we propose a new, cache-friendly, implementation of the rank primitive and advocate for a very simple architecture of the FM-index, which trades compression ratio for speed. Experimental results show that our variants are 2--3 times faster than the fastest known ones, for the price of using typically 1.5--5 times more space.
