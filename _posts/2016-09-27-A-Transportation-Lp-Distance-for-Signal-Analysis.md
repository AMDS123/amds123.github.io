##### Abstract
Transport based distances, such as the Wasserstein distance and earth mover's distance, have been shown to be an effective tool in signal and image analysis. The success of transport based distances is in part due to their Lagrangian nature which allows it to capture the important variations in many signal classes. However these distances require the signal to be nonnegative and normalized. Furthermore, the signals are considered as measures and compared by redistributing (transporting) them, which does not directly take into account the signal intensity. Here we study a transport-based distance, called the $TL^p$ distance, that combines Lagrangian and intensity modelling and is directly applicable to general, non-positive and multi-channelled signals. The framework allows the application of existing numerical methods. We give an overview of the basic properties of this distance and applications to classification, with multi-channelled, non-positive one and two-dimensional signals, and color transfer.

已经证明，基于传播的距离，如Wasserstein距离和地球移动者的距离，是信号和图像分析的有效工具。基于传输的距离的成功部分是由于它们的拉格朗日本质，它允许它捕获许多信号类别中的重要变化。然而，这些距离要求信号是非负的和正常的。此外，信号被认为是测量，并通过重新分配（传输）来进行比较，而不直接考虑信号强度。在这里，我们研究一个基于运输的距离，称为$ TL ^ p $距离，它结合拉格朗日和强度建模，直接适用于一般的，非正的和多通道的信号。该框架允许应用现有的数值方法。我们给出了这个距离的基本属性和应用分类的概述，具有多通道，非正一维和二维信号以及颜色转换。
