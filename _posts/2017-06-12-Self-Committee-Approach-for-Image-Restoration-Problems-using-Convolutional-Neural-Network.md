##### Abstract
There have been many discriminative learning methods using convolutional neural networks (CNN) for several image restoration problems, which learn the mapping function from a degraded input to the clean output. In this letter, we propose a self-committee method that can find enhanced restoration results from the multiple trial of a trained CNN with different but related inputs. Specifically, it is noted that the CNN sometimes finds different mapping functions when the input is transformed by a reversible transform and thus produces different but related outputs with the original. Hence averaging the outputs for several different transformed inputs can enhance the results as evidenced by the network committee methods. Unlike the conventional committee approaches that require several networks, the proposed method needs only a single network. Experimental results show that adding an additional transform as a committee always brings additional gain on image denoising and single image supre-resolution problems.

已经有许多使用卷积神经网络（CNN）的有区别的学习方法用于几个图像恢复问题，其学习从退化输入到干净输出的映射函数。在这封信中，我们提出了一个自我委员会的方法，可以找到一个经过培训的CNN的不同但相关投入的多重审判加强恢复的结果。具体而言，注意到CNN有时在输入被可逆变换变换时找到不同的映射函数，从而产生与原始不同但相关的输出。因此，通过网络委员会的方法可以证明，对几种不同的转换输入进行平均可以提高结果。与传统的需要多个网络的委员会方法不同，所提出的方法只需要一个网络。实验结果表明，作为一个委员会增加一个额外的变换总是带来额外的图像去噪和单幅图像超分辨率问题的好处。
