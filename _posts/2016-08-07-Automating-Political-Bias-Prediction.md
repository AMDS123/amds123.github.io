##### Abstract
Every day media generate large amounts of text. An unbiased view on media reports requires an understanding of the political bias of media content. Assistive technology for estimating the political bias of texts can be helpful in this context. This study proposes a simple statistical learning approach to predict political bias from text. Standard text features extracted from speeches and manifestos of political parties are used to predict political bias in terms of political party affiliation and in terms of political views. Results indicate that political bias can be predicted with above chance accuracy. Mistakes of the model can be interpreted with respect to changes of policies of political actors. Two approaches are presented to make the results more interpretable: a) discriminative text features are related to the political orientation of a party and b) sentiment features of texts are correlated with a measure of political power. Political power appears to be strongly correlated with positive sentiment of a text. To highlight some potential use cases a web application shows how the model can be used for texts for which the political bias is not clear such as news articles.

媒体每天都会生成大量的文字。对媒体报道的不偏不倚的看法需要理解媒体内容的政治偏见。估计文本政治偏见的辅助技术在这方面可能会有所帮助。这项研究提出了一个简单的统计学习方法来预测文本的政治偏见。从政党的演讲和宣言中提取的标准文本特征被用来预测政治派别和政治观点的政治偏见。结果表明，政治偏见可以用高于机会的准确性来预测。模型的错误可以根据政治行为者政策的变化来解释。提出了两种方法使结果更易于理解：a）歧视性文本特征与一个政党的政治取向有关，b）文本的情感特征与一种政治权力相关联。政治权力似乎与文本的积极情绪密切相关。为了突出一些潜在的用例，一个Web应用程序展示了这个模型如何被用于政治偏见不明确的文本，如新闻文章。
