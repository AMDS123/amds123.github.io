##### Abstract
The availability of large scale event data with time stamps has given rise to dynamically evolving knowledge graphs that contain temporal information for each edge. Reasoning over time in such dynamic knowledge graphs is not yet well understood. To this end, we present Know-Evolve, a novel deep evolutionary knowledge network that learns non-linearly evolving entity representations over time. The occurrence of a fact (edge) is modeled as a multivariate point process whose intensity function is modulated by the score for that fact computed based on the learned entity embeddings. We demonstrate significantly improved performance over various relational learning approaches on two large scale real-world datasets. Further, our method effectively predicts occurrence or recurrence time of a fact which is novel compared to prior reasoning approaches in multi-relational setting.

具有时间戳的大规模事件数据的可用性已经引起了包含每个边的时间信息的动态演变的知识图。在这样的动态知识图中推理一段时间还不是很清楚。为此，我们提出Know-Evolve，这是一个新的深入的进化知识网络，学习随着时间的推移非线性演变的实体表示。事实（边缘）的发生被建模为多变量点过程，其强度函数由基于学习实体嵌入计算的事实的分数调制。我们在两个大型真实世界的数据集上展示了各种关系型学习方法的显着改进的性能。此外，我们的方法有效地预测了一个事实的发生或复发时间是比多先前在多关系设置的推理方法新颖。
