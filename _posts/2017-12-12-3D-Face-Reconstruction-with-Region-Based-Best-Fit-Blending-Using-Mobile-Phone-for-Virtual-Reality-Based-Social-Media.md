##### Abstract
The use of virtual reality (VR) is exponentially increasing and due to that many researchers has started to work on developing new VR based social media. For this purpose it is important to have an avatar of the users which look like them to be easily generated by the devices which are accessible, such as mobile phone. In this paper, we propose a novel method of recreating a 3D human face model captured with a phone camera image or video data. The method focuses more on model shape than texture in order to make the face recognizable. We detect 68 facial feature points and use them to separate a face into four regions. For each area the best fitting models are found and are further morphed combined to find the best fitting models for each area. These are then combined and further morphed in order to restore the original facial proportions. We also present a method of texturing the resulting model, where the aforementioned feature points are used to generate a texture for the resulting model

虚拟现实（VR）的使用呈指数增长，由于许多研究人员已经开始致力于开发新的基于VR的社交媒体。为此，重要的是让看起来像他们的用户的化身容易由可访问的设备（例如移动电话）生成。在本文中，我们提出了一种重新创建手机相机图像或视频数据捕获的3D人脸模型的新方法。该方法更注重模型形状而不是纹理，以使人脸可识别。我们检测68个脸部特征点，并用它们将脸部分成四个区域。对于每个区域，找到最佳拟合模型，并进一步变形以找到每个区域的最佳拟合模型。然后将这些组合并进一步变形以恢复原始面部比例。我们还提出了纹理结果模型的方法，其中上述特征点用于生成结果模型的纹理
