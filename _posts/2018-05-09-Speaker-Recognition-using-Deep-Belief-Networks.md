##### Abstract
Short time spectral features such as mel frequency cepstral coefficients(MFCCs) have been previously deployed in state of the art speaker recognition systems, however lesser heed has been paid to short term spectral features that can be learned by generative learning models from speech signals. Higher dimensional encoders such as deep belief networks (DBNs) could improve performance in speaker recognition tasks by better modelling the statistical structure of sound waves. In this paper, we use short term spectral features learnt from the DBN augmented with MFCC features to perform the task of speaker recognition. Using our features, we achieved a recognition accuracy of 0.95 as compared to 0.90 when using standalone MFCC features on the ELSDSR dataset.

诸如梅尔频率倒谱系数（MFCC）之类的短时间频谱特征先前已被部署在现有技术的说话者识别系统中，然而较少考虑到可由生成学习模型从语音信号中学习的短期频谱特征。诸如深度置信网络（DBN）的较高维度编码器可以通过更好地建模声波的统计结构来提高说话者识别任务的性能。在本文中，我们使用从MFN特征中学习的短期谱特征来增强MFCC特征来执行说话者识别的任务。使用我们的功能，我们实现了0.95的识别精度，而在ELSDSR数据集上使用独立的MFCC功能时，识别精度为0.90。
