##### Abstract
Over the past several decades, subspace clustering has been receiving increasing interest and continuous progress. However, due to the lack of scalability and/or robustness, existing methods still have difficulty in dealing with the data that possesses simultaneously three characteristics: high-dimensional, massive and grossly corrupted. To tackle the scalability and robustness issues simultaneously, in this paper we suggest to consider a problem called compressive robust subspace clustering, which is to perform robust subspace clustering with the compressed data, and which is generated by projecting the original high-dimensional data onto a lower-dimensional subspace chosen at random. Given these random projections, the proposed method, row space pursuit (RSP), recovers not only the authentic row space, which provably leads to correct clustering results under certain conditions, but also the gross errors possibly existing in data. The compressive nature of the random projections gives our RSP high computational and storage efficiency, and the recovery property enables the ability for RSP to deal with the grossly corrupted data. Extensive experiments on high-dimensional and/or large-scale datasets show that RSP can maintain comparable accuracies to to prevalent methods with significant reductions in the computational time.

在过去的几十年里，子空间聚类一直受到越来越多的关注并不断取得进展。然而，由于缺少可扩展性和/或鲁棒性，现有方法仍然难以处理同时具有三个特征的数据：高维，大规模和严重损坏。为了同时解决可伸缩性和鲁棒性问题，在本文中，我们建议考虑一个叫做压缩鲁棒子空间聚类的问题，它是用压缩数据执行鲁棒子空间聚类，并且通过将原始高维数据投影到随机选择较低维的子空间。在给定这些随机投影的情况下，所提出的行空间追踪（RSP）方法不仅可以恢复真实的行空间，从而可以在某些条件下正确地获得聚类结果，还可以恢复数据中可能存在的严重错误。随机投影的压缩特性为我们的RSP提供了高计算和存储效率，并且恢复特性使RSP能够处理严重损坏的数据。在高维和/或大规模数据集上进行的大量实验表明，RSP可以保持与普遍方法相当的准确性，同时显着减少计算时间。
