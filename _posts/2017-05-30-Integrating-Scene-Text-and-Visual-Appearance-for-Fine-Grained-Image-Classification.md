##### Abstract
Text in natural images contains rich semantics that are often highly relevant to objects or scene. In this paper, we focus on the problem of fully exploiting scene text for visual understanding. The main idea is combining word representations and deep visual features into a globally trainable deep convolutional neural network. First, the recognized words are obtained by a scene text reading system. Then, we combine the word embedding of the recognized words and the deep visual features into a single representation, which is optimized by a convolutional neural network for fine-grained image classification. In our framework, the attention mechanism is adopted to reveal the relevance between each recognized word and the given image, which further enhances the recognition performance. We have performed experiments on two datasets: Con-Text dataset and Drink Bottle dataset, that are proposed for fine-grained classification of business places and drink bottles, respectively. The experimental results consistently demonstrate that the proposed method combining textual and visual cues significantly outperforms classification with only visual representations. Moreover, we have shown that the learned representation improves the retrieval performance on the drink bottle images by a large margin, making it potentially useful in product search.

自然图像中的文本包含丰富的语义，通常与对象或场景高度相关。在本文中，我们着重于充分利用场景文本进行视觉理解的问题。其主要思想是将词汇表达和深层视觉特征结合成一个全球可训练的深度卷积神经网络。首先，通过场景文本阅读系统获得识别的单词。然后，将识别词的单词嵌入和深层视觉特征合并为一个单一的表示，并通过卷积神经网络进行细化图像分类。在我们的框架中，采用注意机制来揭示每个识别词与给定图像之间的相关性，进一步提高识别性能。我们已经对两个数据集进行了实验：Con-Text数据集和Drink Bottle数据集，分别针对商业场所和饮料瓶进行细粒度分类。实验结果一致表明，提出的文本和视觉线索相结合的方法显着优于只有视觉表示的分类。此外，我们已经表明，学习表示大大提高了饮料瓶图像的检索性能，使其在产品检索中潜在地有用。
