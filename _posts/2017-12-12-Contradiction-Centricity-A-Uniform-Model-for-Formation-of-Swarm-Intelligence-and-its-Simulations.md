##### Abstract
It is a grand challenge to model the emergence of swarm intelligence and many principles or models had been proposed. However, existing models do not catch the nature of swarm intelligence and they are not generic enough to describe various types of emergence phenomena. In this work, we propose a contradiction-centric model for emergence of swarm intelligence, in which individuals' contradictions dominate their appearances whilst they are associated and interacting to update their contradictions. This model hypothesizes that 1) the emergence of swarm intelligence is rooted in the development of contradictions of individuals and the interactions among associated individuals and 2) swarm intelligence is essentially a combinative reflection of the configurations of contradictions inside individuals and the distributions of contradictions among individuals. To verify the feasibility of the model, we simulate four types of swarm intelligence. As the simulations show, our model is truly generic and can describe the emergence of a variety of swarm intelligence, and it is also very simple and can be easily applied to demonstrate the emergence of swarm intelligence without needing complicated computations.

模拟群体智能的出现是一个巨大的挑战，并提出了许多原则或模型。然而，现有的模型并没有捕捉到群体智能的本质，而且它们还不具有足够的通用性来描述各种涌现现象。在这项工作中，我们提出了一个以矛盾为中心的群体智能出现模型，在这个模型中，个体的矛盾主宰着他们的表象，而他们相互联系并相互作用以更新他们的矛盾。该模型假设：1）群体智能的出现根源于个体矛盾的发展和相关个体之间的相互作用; 2）群体智能本质上是对个体内部矛盾形态和个体矛盾分布的综合反映。为了验证模型的可行性，我们模拟了四种类型的群体智能。仿真表明，我们的模型是真正的通用的，可以描述各种群体智能的出现，它也非常简单，可以很容易地应用于演示群体智能的出现，而不需要复杂的计算。
