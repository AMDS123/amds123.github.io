##### Abstract
Recent developments in monetary policy by the Federal Reserve has created a need for an objective method of communication analysis.Using methods developed for text analysis, we present a novel technique of analysis which creates a semantic space defined by various policymakers public comments and places the committee consensus in the appropriate location. Its then possible to determine which member of the committee is most closely aligned with the committee consensus over time and create a foundation for further actionable research.

美联储最近对货币政策的发展产生了对客观通信分析方法的需求。使用为文本分析开发的方法，我们提出了一种新颖的分析技术，创建由各种决策者公共评论定义的语义空间，并将委员会在适当的地点达成共识。然后可以确定哪个委员会成员与委员会的共识最为一致，并为进一步可行的研究奠定基础。
