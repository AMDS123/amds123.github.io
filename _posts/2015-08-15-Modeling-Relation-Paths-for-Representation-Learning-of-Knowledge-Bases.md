##### Abstract
Representation learning of knowledge bases (KBs) aims to embed both entities and relations into a low-dimensional space. Most existing methods only consider direct relations in representation learning. We argue that multiple-step relation paths also contain rich inference patterns between entities, and propose a path-based representation learning model. This model considers relation paths as translations between entities for representation learning, and addresses two key challenges: (1) Since not all relation paths are reliable, we design a path-constraint resource allocation algorithm to measure the reliability of relation paths. (2) We represent relation paths via semantic composition of relation embeddings. Experimental results on real-world datasets show that, as compared with baselines, our model achieves significant and consistent improvements on knowledge base completion and relation extraction from text.

知识库（KB）的表示学习旨在将实体和关系嵌入到低维空间中。大多数现有的方法只考虑表示学习中的直接关系。我们认为多步关系路径也包含了实体间丰富的推理模式，提出了一种基于路径的表征学习模型。该模型将关系路径视为表示学习的实体之间的翻译，并解决了两个关键的挑战：（1）由于并不是所有的关系路径都是可靠的，因此我们设计了一个路径约束资源分配算法来衡量关系路径的可靠性。 （2）通过关系嵌入的语义构成表示关系路径。实际数据集的实验结果表明，与基线相比，我们的模型在文本知识库完成和关系提取方面取得了显着和一致的改进。
