##### Abstract
Time-Series Classification (TSC) has attracted a lot of attention in pattern recognition, because wide range of applications from different domains such as finance and health informatics deal with time-series signals. Bag of Features (BoF) model has achieved a great success in TSC task by summarizing signals according to the frequencies of "feature words" of a data-learned dictionary. This paper proposes embedding the Recurrence Plots (RP), a visualization technique for analysis of dynamic systems, in the BoF model for TSC. While the traditional BoF approach extracts features from 1D signal segments, this paper uses the RP to transform time-series into 2D texture images and then applies the BoF on them. Image representation of time-series enables us to explore different visual descriptors that are not available for 1D signals and to treats TSC task as a texture recognition problem. Experimental results on the UCI time-series classification archive demonstrates a significant accuracy boost by the proposed Bag of Recurrence patterns (BoR), compared not only to the existing BoF models, but also to the state-of-the art algorithms.

时间序列分类（TSC）在模式识别中引起了很多关注，因为来自财务和健康信息等不同领域的广泛应用涉及时间序列信号。袋特征（BoF）模型通过根据数据学习字典的“特征词”的频率汇总信号在TSC任务中取得了巨大成功。本文提出在TSF的BoF模型中嵌入循环图（RP），一种用于分析动态系统的可视化技术。虽然传统的BoF方法从一维信号片段中提取特征，但本文使用RP将时间序列转换为二维纹理图像，然后在其上应用BoF。时间序列的图像表示使我们能够探索不可用于1D信号的不同视觉描述符，并将TSC任务视为纹理识别问题。 UCI时间序列分类归档的实验结果表明，所提出的Bag of Recurrence patterns（BoR）显着提高了准确度，不仅与现有的BoF模型相比，而且还与最先进的算法相比。
