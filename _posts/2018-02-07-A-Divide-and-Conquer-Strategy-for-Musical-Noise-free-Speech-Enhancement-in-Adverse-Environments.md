##### Abstract
A divide and conquer strategy for enhancement of noisy speeches in adverse environments involving lower levels of SNR is presented in this paper, where the total system of speech enhancement is divided into two separate steps. The first step is based on noise compensation on short time magnitude and the second step is based on phase compensation. The magnitude spectrum is compensated based on a modified spectral subtraction method where the cross-terms containing spectra of noise and clean speech are taken into consideration, which are neglected in the traditional spectral subtraction methods. By employing the modified magnitude and unchanged phase, a procedure is formulated to compensate the overestimation or underestimation of noise by phase compensation method based on the probability of speech presence. A modified complex spectrum based on these two steps are obtained to synthesize a musical noise free enhanced speech. Extensive simulations are carried out using the speech files available in the NOIZEUS database in order to evaluate the performance of the proposed method. It is shown in terms of the objective measures, spectrogram analysis and formal subjective listening tests that the proposed method consistently outperforms some of the state-of-the-art methods of speech enhancement for noisy speech corrupted by street or babble noise at very low as well as medium levels of SNR.

本文提出了一个分歧和征服策略，用于增强在较低信噪比下的不利环境下的嘈杂演讲，整个语音增强系统分为两个独立的步骤。第一步是基于短时间幅度的噪声补偿，第二步是基于相位补偿。幅度谱是基于改进的谱减法来补偿的，其中考虑了包含噪声和干净语音的谱的交叉项，这在传统谱减法中被忽略。通过采用修正幅度和不变相位的方法，根据语音存在的概率，采用相位补偿方法来补偿噪声的高估或低估。基于这两个步骤的改进的复合谱被合成为音乐无噪声增强语音。为了评估所提出的方法的性能，使用NOIZEUS数据库中可用的语音文件进行了大量的模拟。从客观测量，频谱图分析和形式化主观听力测试的角度来看，所提出的方法一直优于一些最先进的语音增强方法，以及中等水平的信噪比。
