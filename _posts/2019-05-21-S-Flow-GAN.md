##### Abstract
This work offers a new method for generating photo-realistic images from semantic label maps and a simulator edge map images. We do so in a conditional manner, where we train a Generative Adversarial network (GAN) given an image and its semantic label map to output a photo-realistic version of that scene. Existing architectures of GANs still lack the photo-realism capabilities. We address this issue by embedding edge maps, and presenting the Generator with an edge map image as a prior, which enables generating high level details in the image. We offer a model that uses this generator to create visually appealing videos as well, when a sequence of images is given.
