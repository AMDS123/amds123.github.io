##### Abstract
This paper proposes a simple yet effective approach to learn visual features online for improving loop-closure detection and place recognition, based on bag-of-words frameworks. The approach learns a codeword in bag-of-words model from a pair of matched features from two consecutive frames, such that the codeword has temporally-derived perspective invariance to camera motion. The learning algorithm is efficient: the binary descriptor is generated from the mean image patch, and the mask is learned based on discriminative projection by minimizing the intra-class distances among the learned feature and the two original features. A codeword for bag-of-words models is generated by packaging the learned descriptor and mask, with a masked Hamming distance defined to measure the distance between two codewords. The geometric properties of the learned codewords are then mathematically justified. In addition, hypothesis constraints are imposed through temporal consistency in matched codewords, which improves precision. The approach, integrated in an incremental bag-of-words system, is validated on multiple benchmark data sets and compared to state-of-the-art methods. Experiments demonstrate improved precision/recall outperforming state of the art with little loss in runtime.

本文提出了一种简单而有效的方法来在线学习视觉特征，以改善闭环检测和地点识别。该方法从两个连续帧中的一对匹配特征中学习词袋模型中的码字，使得码字具有相对于相机运动的时间导出的透视不变性。学习算法是高效的：从平均图像块生成二进制描述符，并且通过最小化学习特征和两个原始特征之间的类内距离来基于差异投影学习掩码。通过打包学习的描述符和掩码来产生袋字模型的码字，其中定义了屏蔽的汉明距离来测量两个码字之间的距离。学习码字的几何特性然后在数学上是合理的。另外，通过匹配码字中的时间一致性来施加假设约束，这提高了精度。该方法集成在一个增量式的词袋系统中，在多个基准数据集上进行验证，并与最先进的方法进行比较。实验表明，在运行时几乎没有损失的情况下，提高了精度/回忆性能。
