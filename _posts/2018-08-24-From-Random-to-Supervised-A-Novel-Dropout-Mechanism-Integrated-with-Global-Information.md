##### Abstract
Dropout is used to avoid overfitting by randomly dropping units from the neural networks during training. Inspired by dropout, this paper presents GI-Dropout, a novel dropout method integrating with global information to improve neural networks for text classification. Unlike the traditional dropout method in which the units are dropped randomly according to the same probability, we aim to use explicit instructions based on global information of the dataset to guide the training process. With GI-Dropout, the model is supposed to pay more attention to inapparent features or patterns. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the dropout with global information on seven text classification tasks, including sentiment analysis and topic classification.

Dropout用于通过在训练期间从神经网络中随机丢弃单位来避免过度拟合。受到辍学的启发，本文提出了GI-Dropout，这是一种融合全球信息的新型辍学方法，用于改进文本分类的神经网络。与传统的辍学方法不同，其中单位根据相同的概率随机丢弃，我们的目标是使用基于数据集的全局信息的显式指令来指导训练过程。通过GI-Dropout，该模型应该更多地关注不明显的特征或模式。实验证明了具有七个文本分类任务的全局信息的丢失的有效性，包括情感分析和主题分类。
