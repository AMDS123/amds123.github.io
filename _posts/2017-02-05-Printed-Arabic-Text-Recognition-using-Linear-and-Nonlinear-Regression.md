##### Abstract
Arabic language is one of the most popular languages in the world. Hundreds of millions of people in many countries around the world speak Arabic as their native speaking. However, due to complexity of Arabic language, recognition of printed and handwritten Arabic text remained untouched for a very long time compared with English and Chinese. Although, in the last few years, significant number of researches has been done in recognizing printed and handwritten Arabic text, it stills an open research field due to cursive nature of Arabic script. This paper proposes automatic printed Arabic text recognition technique based on linear and ellipse regression techniques. After collecting all possible forms of each character, unique code is generated to represent each character form. Each code contains a sequence of lines and ellipses. To recognize fonts, a unique list of codes is identified to be used as a fingerprint of font. The proposed technique has been evaluated using over 14000 different Arabic words with different fonts and experimental results show that average recognition rate of the proposed technique is 86%.

阿拉伯语是世界上最流行的语言之一。世界上许多国家的亿万人口都会讲阿拉伯语。然而，由于阿拉伯语的复杂性，与英文和中文相比，对印刷和手写阿拉伯文本的认可在很长一段时间内保持不变。尽管在过去几年里，阿拉伯文的印刷和手写已经有了大量的研究，但由于阿拉伯文的草写性，它仍然是一个开放的研究领域。本文提出了基于线性和椭圆回归技术的自动印刷阿拉伯文字识别技术。在收集每个字符的所有可能的形式之后，生成唯一的代码来表示每个字符形式。每个代码都包含一系列的线和椭圆。为了识别字体，识别唯一的代码列表以用作字体的指纹。所提出的技术已经被使用超过14000个不同字体的不同阿拉伯字体进行了评估，实验结果表明该技术的平均识别率为86％。
