##### Abstract
SAR (Synthetic Aperture Radar) imaging plays a central role in Remote Sensing due to, among other important features, its ability to provide high-resolution, day-and-night and almost weather-independent images. SAR images are affected from a granular contamination, speckle, that can be described by a multiplicative model. Many despeckling techniques have been proposed in the literature, as well as measures of the quality of the results they provide. Assuming the multiplicative model, the observed image $Z$ is the product of two independent fields: the backscatter $X$ and the speckle $Y$. The result of any speckle filter is $\widehat X$, an estimator of the backscatter $X$, based solely on the observed data $Z$. An ideal estimator would be the one for which the ratio of the observed image to the filtered one $I=Z/\widehat X$ is only speckle: a collection of independent identically distributed samples from Gamma variates. We, then, assess the quality of a filter by the closeness of $I$ to the hypothesis that it is adherent to the statistical properties of pure speckle. We analyze filters through the ratio image they produce with regards to first- and second-order statistics: the former check marginal properties, while the latter verifies lack of structure. A new quantitative image-quality index is then defined, and applied to state-of-the-art despeckling filters. This new measure provides consistent results with commonly used quality measures (equivalent number of looks, PSNR, MSSIM, $\beta$ edge correlation, and preservation of the mean), and ranks the filters results also in agreement with their visual analysis. We conclude our study showing that the proposed measure can be successfully used to optimize the (often many) parameters that define a speckle filter.

SAR（合成孔径雷达）成像在遥感中扮演着重要角色，除其他重要特征之外，它还能够提供高分辨率，一日一夜和几乎与天气无关的图像。 SAR图像受到颗粒污染，散斑的影响，可以用乘法模型来描述。文献中已经提出了许多去斑技术以及它们提供的结果的质量的量度。假设乘法模型，观察图像$ Z $是两个独立场的结果：反向散射$ X $和散斑$ Y $。任何斑点滤波器的结果是$ \ widehat X $，一个反向散射估计量$ X $，完全基于观测数据$ Z $。一个理想的估计量就是观察到的图像与过滤后的图像的比值。只有散斑：来自伽玛变量的独立同分布样本的集合。然后，我们通过贴近$ I $来评估滤波器的质量，假设它符合纯散斑的统计特性。我们通过它们产生的比率图像来分析滤波器的一阶和二阶统计量：前者检查边际属性，而后者则验证结构缺乏。然后定义一个新的定量图像质量指数，并将其应用于最先进的去斑滤波器。这个新的测量方法提供了与常用的质量测量结果（相当数量的外观，PSNR，MSSIM，$ \ beta $边缘相关性和平均值的保留）一致的结果，并将过滤器结果与其视觉分析相一致。我们得出结论，我们的研究表明，所提出的措施可以成功地用来优化（经常是许多）定义斑点过滤器的参数。
