##### Abstract
This article explores the ideas that went into George Boole's development of an algebra for logical inference in his book The Laws of Thought. We explore in particular his wife Mary Boole's claim that he was deeply influenced by Indian logic and argue that his work was more than a framework for processing propositions. By exploring parallels between his work and Indian logic, we are able to explain several peculiarities of this work.

##### Abstract (translated by Google)
本文探讨乔治布尔在他的着作“法律思想”一书中对逻辑推理代数的发展。我们特别探讨了他的妻子玛丽布尔的说法，他深受印度逻辑的影响，并认为他的工作不仅仅是一个处理命题的框架。通过探索他的工作和印度逻辑之间的相似之处，我们能够解释这项工作的几个特点。
