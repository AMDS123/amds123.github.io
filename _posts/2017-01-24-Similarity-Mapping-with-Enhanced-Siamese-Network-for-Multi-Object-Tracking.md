##### Abstract
Multi-object tracking has recently become an important area of computer vision, especially for Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS). Despite growing attention, achieving high performance tracking is still challenging, with state-of-the- art systems resulting in high complexity with a large number of hyper parameters. In this paper, we focus on reducing overall system complexity and the number hyper parameters that need to be tuned to a specific environment. We introduce a novel tracking system based on similarity mapping by Enhanced Siamese Neural Network (ESNN), which accounts for both appearance and geometric information, and is trainable end-to-end. Our system achieves competitive performance in both speed and accuracy on MOT16 challenge, compared to known state-of-the-art methods.

多目标跟踪最近已经成为计算机视觉的一个重要领域，尤其是高级驾驶辅助系统（ADAS）。尽管越来越多的关注，实现高性能跟踪仍然是具有挑战性的，最先进的系统导致高复杂度和大量的超参数。在本文中，我们着重于减少整个系统的复杂性和需要调整到特定环境的数量超参数。我们引入了一种基于增强连体神经网络（ESNN）的相似性映射的新型跟踪系统，该系统兼顾外观和几何信息，并可端到端地进行可训练。与已知最先进的方法相比，我们的系统在速度和准确度方面均实现了竞争优势。
