##### Abstract
One of the challenges in conducting research on the intersection of the CHI and Human-Robot Interaction (HRI) communities is in addressing the gap of acceptable design research methods between the two. While HRI is focused on interaction with robots and includes design research in its scope, the community is not as accustomed to exploratory design methods as the CHI community. This workshop paper argues for bringing exploratory design, and specifically Research through Design (RtD) methods that have been established in CHI for the past decade to the foreground of HRI. RtD can enable design researchers in the field of HRI to conduct exploratory design work that asks what is the right thing to design and share it within the community.
