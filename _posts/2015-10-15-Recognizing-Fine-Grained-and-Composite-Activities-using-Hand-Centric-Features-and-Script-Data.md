##### Abstract
Activity recognition has shown impressive progress in recent years. However, the challenges of detecting fine-grained activities and understanding how they are combined into composite activities have been largely overlooked. In this work we approach both tasks and present a dataset which provides detailed annotations to address them. The first challenge is to detect fine-grained activities, which are defined by low inter-class variability and are typically characterized by fine-grained body motions. We explore how human pose and hands can help to approach this challenge by comparing two pose-based and two hand-centric features with state-of-the-art holistic features. To attack the second challenge, recognizing composite activities, we leverage the fact that these activities are compositional and that the essential components of the activities can be obtained from textual descriptions or scripts. We show the benefits of our hand-centric approach for fine-grained activity classification and detection. For composite activity recognition we find that decomposition into attributes allows sharing information across composites and is essential to attack this hard task. Using script data we can recognize novel composites without having training data for them.

近年来，活动认可取得了令人瞩目的进展。然而，检测细粒度活动和理解它们如何组合成复合活动的挑战在很大程度上被忽视了。在这项工作中，我们处理这两个任务，并提供一个数据集，提供详细的注释来解决这些问题。第一个挑战是检测细粒度的活动，这些活动是由低级间变化定义的，并且通常以细粒体动作为特征。我们通过比较两个基于姿势的和两个以手为中心的特征与最先进的整体特征来探索人的姿势和双手如何帮助我们迎接这一挑战。为了攻击第二个挑战，认识复合活动，我们利用这些活动是组成性的，并且可以从文本描述或脚本中获得活动的基本组成部分。我们展示了我们以手为中心的细粒度活动分类和检测方法的好处。对于复合活动识别，我们发现将属性分解可以在复合材料之间共享信息，并且对于攻击这个艰巨的任务至关重要。使用脚本数据，我们可以识别新型复合材料，而不需要他们的训练数据。
