##### Abstract
We study characteristics of receptive fields of units in deep convolutional networks. The receptive field size is a crucial issue in many visual tasks, as the output must respond to large enough areas in the image to capture information about large objects. We introduce the notion of an effective receptive field, and show that it both has a Gaussian distribution and only occupies a fraction of the full theoretical receptive field. We analyze the effective receptive field in several architecture designs, and the effect of nonlinear activations, dropout, sub-sampling and skip connections on it. This leads to suggestions for ways to address its tendency to be too small.

我们研究深度卷积网络中单位的接受域特征。接受的字段大小是许多视觉任务中的关键问题，因为输出必须响应图像中足够大的区域来捕捉有关大型对象的信息。我们引入一个有效的感受场的概念，并且表明它们都是高斯分布，只占据理论接受场的一小部分。我们分析了几种体系结构设计中的有效接受域，以及非线性激活，丢失，子采样和跳过连接对其的影响。这导致了如何解决其过小的趋势的建议。
