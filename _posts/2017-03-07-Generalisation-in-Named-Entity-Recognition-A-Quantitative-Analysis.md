##### Abstract
Named Entity Recognition (NER) is a key NLP task, which is all the more challenging on Web and user-generated content with their diverse and continuously changing language. This paper aims to quantify how this diversity impacts state-of-the-art NER methods, by measuring named entity (NE) and context variability, feature sparsity, and their effects on precision and recall. In particular, our findings indicate that NER approaches struggle to generalise in diverse genres with limited training data. Unseen NEs, in particular, play an important role, which have a higher incidence in diverse genres such as social media than in more regular genres such as newswire. Coupled with a higher incidence of unseen features more generally and the lack of large training corpora, this leads to significantly lower F1 scores for diverse genres as compared to more regular ones. We also find that leading systems rely heavily on surface forms found in training data, having problems generalising beyond these, and offer explanations for this observation.

命名实体识别（NER）是一项关键的NLP任务，对于网络和用户生成的内容而言，它们具有多样性和不断变化的语言，因此更具挑战性。本文旨在量化这种多样性如何影响最先进的NER方法，通过测量命名实体（NE）和上下文变异性，特征稀疏性及其对精度和召回的影响。具体而言，我们的研究结果表明，NER方法难以在有限的训练数据下推广到各种类型。特别是看不见的网元在社交媒体等多种流派中的发生率高于新闻通讯等更为常见的流派。加之更普遍看不到的特征的发生率较高，缺乏大量的训练语料库，这导致与更普通的类型相比，不同类型的F1得分显着降低。我们还发现，领先的系统严重依赖于训练数据中的表面形式，除此之外还存在一些问题，并提供对这种观察的解释。
