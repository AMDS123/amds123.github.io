##### Abstract
Illusions are fascinating and immediately catch people's attention and interest, but they are also valuable in terms of giving us insights into human cognition and perception. A good theory of human perception should be able to explain the illusion, and a correct theory will actually give quantifiable results. We investigate here the efficiency of a computational filtering model utilised for modelling the lateral inhibition of retinal ganglion cells and their responses to a range of Geometric Illusions using isotropic Differences of Gaussian filters. This study explores the way in which illusions have been explained and shows how a simple standard model of vision based on classical receptive fields can predict the existence of these illusions as well as the degree of effect. A fundamental contribution of this work is to link bottom-up processes to higher level perception and cognition consistent with Marr's theory of vision and edge map representation.
