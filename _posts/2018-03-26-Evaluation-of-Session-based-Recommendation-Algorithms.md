##### Abstract
Recommender systems help users find relevant items of interest, for example on e-commerce or media streaming sites. Most academic research is concerned with approaches that personalize the recommendations according to long-term user profiles. In many real-world applications, however, such long-term profiles often do not exist and recommendations therefore have to be made solely based on the observed behavior of a user during an ongoing session. Given the high practical relevance of the problem, an increased interest in this problem can be observed in recent years, leading to a number of proposals for session-based recommendation algorithms that typically aim to predict the user's immediate next actions. In this work, we present the results of an in-depth performance comparison of a number of such algorithms, using a variety of datasets and evaluation measures. Our comparison includes the most recent approaches based on recurrent neural networks like GRU4REC, factorized Markov model approaches such as FISM or Fossil, as well as more simple methods based, e.g., on nearest neighbor schemes. Our experiments reveal that algorithms of this latter class, despite their sometimes almost trivial nature, often perform equally well or significantly better than today's more complex approaches based on deep neural networks. Our results therefore suggest that there is substantial room for improvement regarding the development of more sophisticated session-based recommendation algorithms.

推荐系统帮助用户找到相关的兴趣项目，例如电子商务或媒体流媒体网站。大多数学术研究都关注根据长期用户配置文件个性化建议的方法。然而，在许多现实世界的应用中，这样的长期配置文件通常不存在，因此必须仅仅基于在正在进行的会话期间观察到的用户行为来提出建议。鉴于问题的实际相关性较高，近年来可以观察到对这个问题的兴趣增加，从而导致了许多基于会话的推荐算法的建议，这些建议通常旨在预测用户的紧接着的下一步行动。在这项工作中，我们使用各种数据集和评估方法，展示了一些这类算法的深入性能比较结果。我们的比较包括基于像GRU4REC这样的递归神经网络的最新方法，诸如FISM或Fossil的因子化马尔科夫模型方法，以及基于例如最近邻居方案的更简单的方法。我们的实验表明，后一类的算法尽管有时几乎没有微不足道的性质，但它们的表现通常与现在基于深度神经网络的更为复杂的方法相比表现更好或明显更好。因此，我们的结果表明，在开发更复杂的基于会话的推荐算法方面还有很大的改进空间。
