##### Abstract
In recent years, deep learning models have resulted in a huge amount of progress in various areas, including computer vision. By nature, the supervised training of deep models requires a large amount of data to be available. This ideal case is usually not tractable as the data annotation is a tremendously exhausting and costly task to perform. An alternative is to use synthetic data. In this paper, we take a comprehensive look into the effects of replacing real data with synthetic data. We further analyze the effects of having a limited amount of real data. We use multiple synthetic and real datasets along with a simulation tool to create large amounts of cheaply annotated synthetic data. We analyze the domain similarity of each of these datasets. We provide insights about designing a methodological procedure for training deep networks using these datasets.
