##### Abstract
Texture analysis and classification are some of the problems which have been paid much attention by image processing scientists since late 80s. If texture analysis is done accurately, it can be used in many cases such as object tracking, visual pattern recognition, and face recognition.Since now, so many methods are offered to solve this problem. Against their technical differences, all of them used same popular databases to evaluate their performance such asBrodatz or Outex, which may be made their performance biased on these databases. In this paper, an approach is proposed to collect more efficient databases of texture images. The proposed approach is included two stages. The first one is developing feature representation based on gray tone difference matrixes and local binary patterns features and the next one is consisted an innovative algorithm which is based on K-means clustering to collect images based on evaluated features. In order to evaluate the performance of the proposed approach, a texture database is collected and fisher rate is computed for collected one and well known databases. Also, texture classification is evaluated based on offered feature extraction and the accuracy is compared by some state of the art texture classification methods.

纹理分析和分类是80年代末以来图像处理科学家们关注的一些问题。如果纹理分析是准确的，它可以用在很多情况下，如对象跟踪，视觉模式识别和人脸识别。现在，有很多方法可以解决这个问题。针对他们的技术差异，他们都使用相同的流行数据库来评估他们的表现，例如Br​​odatz或Outex，这可能会使他们的表现偏向于这些数据库。在本文中，提出了一种方法来收集更高效的纹理图像数据库。建议的方法包括两个阶段。第一种是基于灰度差异矩阵和局部二值模式特征开发特征表示，其次是基于K-means聚类的基于评估特征的图像聚类的创新算法。为了评估所提出的方法的性能，收集纹理数据库并计算收集的一个和众所周知的数据库的费率。另外，基于提供的特征提取来评估纹理分类，并且通过一些现有技术的纹理分类方法来比较准确性。
