##### Abstract
Several studies on sentence processing suggest that the mental lexicon keeps track of the mutual expectations between words. Current DSMs, however, represent context words as separate features, thereby loosing important information for word expectations, such as word interrelations. In this paper, we present a DSM that addresses this issue by defining verb contexts as joint syntactic dependencies. We test our representation in a verb similarity task on two datasets, showing that joint contexts achieve performances comparable to single dependencies or even better. Moreover, they are able to overcome the data sparsity problem of joint feature spaces, in spite of the limited size of our training corpus.

一些关于句子处理的研究表明，心理词汇可以追踪词语之间的相互期望。然而，当前的DSM将上下文单词表示为单独的特征，从而丢失了诸如单词相互关系之类的单词期望的重要信息。在本文中，我们提出了一个DSM，通过将动词上下文定义为联合语法依赖关系来解决这个问题。我们在两个数据集上的动词相似性任务中测试我们的表示，表明联合上下文获得的性能可以与单个依赖性相比甚至更好。而且，尽管训练语料库的规模有限，但它们能够克服联合特征空间的数据稀疏性问题。
