##### Abstract
In recent years, emotion detection in text has become more popular due to its vast potential applications in marketing, political science, psychology, human-computer interaction, artificial intelligence, etc. Access to a huge amount of textual data, especially opinionated and self-expression text also played a special role to bring attention to this field. In this paper, we review the work that has been done in identifying emotion expressions in text and argue that although many techniques, methodologies, and models have been created to detect emotion in text, there are various reasons that make these methods insufficient. Although, there is an essential need to improve the design and architecture of current systems, factors such as the complexity of human emotions, and the use of implicit and metaphorical language in expressing it, lead us to think that just re-purposing standard methodologies will not be enough to capture these complexities, and it is important to pay attention to the linguistic intricacies of emotion expression.

近年来，由于在市场营销，政治学，心理学，人机交互，人工智能等领域的广泛应用，文本中的情感检测变得越来越流行。获取大量的文本数据，特别是自以为是的，表达文本也起到了特殊的作用，引起了人们对这一领域的关注。在本文中，我们回顾了在文本中识别情感表达时所做的工作，并认为尽管已经创建了许多技术，方法和模型来检测文本中的情感，但存在各种原因使得这些方法不够充分。尽管改善现有系统的设计和体系结构是必不可少的，但诸如人类情感的复杂性和表达它的隐含和隐喻性语言等因素导致我们认为仅仅重新使用标准方法就会不足以捕捉到这些复杂性，关注情感表达的语言错综复杂情况很重要。
