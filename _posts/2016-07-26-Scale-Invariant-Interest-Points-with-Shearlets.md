##### Abstract
Shearlets are a relatively new directional multi-scale framework for signal analysis, which have been shown effective to enhance signal discontinuities such as edges and corners at multiple scales. In this work we address the problem of detecting and describing blob-like features in the shearlets framework. We derive a measure which is very effective for blob detection and closely related to the Laplacian of Gaussian. We demonstrate the measure satisfies the perfect scale invariance property in the continuous case. In the discrete setting, we derive algorithms for blob detection and keypoint description. Finally, we provide qualitative justifications of our findings as well as a quantitative evaluation on benchmark data. We also report an experimental evidence that our method is very suitable to deal with compressed and noisy images, thanks to the sparsity property of shearlets.

##### Abstract (translated by Google)
Shearlets是一个相对较新的定向多尺度信号分析框架，已被证明可有效地增强信号不连续性，如多尺度的边缘和拐角。在这项工作中，我们解决了在shearlets框架中检测和描述blob-like特征的问题。我们推导出一种非常有效的斑点检测方法，并且与高斯拉普拉斯算子密切相关。我们证明这个度量满足连续情况下的完美尺度不变性。在离散设置中，我们推导了斑点检测算法和关键点描述。最后，我们为我们的研究结果提供定性理由，并对基准数据进行定量评估。我们还报告了一个实验证据，由于剪切片的稀疏性，我们的方法非常适合处理压缩和噪声的图像。
