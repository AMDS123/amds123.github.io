##### Abstract
Most recent approaches to monocular 3D human pose estimation rely on Deep Learning. They typically involve regressing from an image to either 3D joint coordinates directly or 2D joint locations from which 3D coordinates are inferred. Both approaches have their strengths and weaknesses and we therefore propose a novel architecture designed to deliver the best of both worlds by performing both simultaneously and fusing the information along the way. At the heart of our framework is a trainable fusion scheme that learns how to fuse the information optimally instead of being hand-designed. This yields significant improvements upon the state-of-the-art on standard 3D human pose estimation benchmarks.

单眼3D人体姿态估计的最新方法依赖于深度学习。它们通常涉及从图像回归直接的3D关节坐标或从中推断3D坐标的2D关节位置。两种方法都有其优缺点，因此我们提出了一种新颖的架构，旨在通过同时执行和融合信息来实现两全其美。我们框架的核心是一个可训练的融合方案，学习如何融合信息而不是手工设计。这对标准3D人体姿势估算基准的最新技术产生了显着的改进。
