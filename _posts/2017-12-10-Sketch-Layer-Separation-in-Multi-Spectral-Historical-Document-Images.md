##### Abstract
High-resolution imaging has delivered new prospects for detecting the material composition and structure of cultural treasures. Despite the various techniques for analysis, a significant diagnostic gap remained in the range of available research capabilities for works on paper. Old master drawings were mostly composed in a multi-step manner with various materials. This resulted in the overlapping of different layers which made the subjacent strata difficult to differentiate. The separation of stratified layers using imaging methods could provide insights into the artistic work processes and help answer questions about the object, its attribution, or in identifying forgeries. The pattern recognition procedure was tested with mock replicas to achieve the separation and the capability of displaying concealed red chalk under ink. In contrast to RGB-sensor based imaging, the multi- or hyperspectral technology allows accurate layer separation by recording the characteristic signatures of the material's reflectance. The risk of damage to the artworks as a result of the examination can be reduced by using combinations of defined spectra for lightning and image capturing. By guaranteeing the maximum level of readability, our results suggest that the technique can be applied to a broader range of objects and assist in diagnostic research into cultural treasures in the future.

##### Abstract (translated by Google)
高分辨率成像为探测文物的构成和结构提供了新的前景。尽管有各种分析技术，但纸上作品的可用研究能力仍然存在显着的诊断差距。旧的主要图纸大多是由多种材料组成的。这导致了不同层次的重叠，使得下层地层难以区分。使用成像方法分层分层可以提供对艺术作品流程的洞察力，并帮助回答有关对象，属性或识别伪造的问题。模式识别程序用模拟副本进行测试以实现分离和在油墨下显示隐藏的红色粉笔的能力。与基于RGB传感器的成像相比，多光谱或高光谱技术通过记录材料反射率的特征标记来实现精确的层分离。通过使用用于闪电和图像捕获的定义光谱的组合，可以减少作为检查结果损坏作品的风险。通过保证可读性的最高水平，我们的结果表明，该技术可以应用于更广泛的对象，并有助于对未来文化宝藏进行诊断性研究。
