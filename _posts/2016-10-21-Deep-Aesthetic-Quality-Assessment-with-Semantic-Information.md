##### Abstract
Human beings often assess the aesthetic quality of an image coupled with the identification of the image's semantic content. This paper addresses the correlation issue between automatic aesthetic quality assessment and semantic recognition. We cast the assessment problem as the main task among a multi-task deep model, and argue that semantic recognition task offers the key to address this problem. Based on convolutional neural networks, we employ a single and simple multi-task framework to efficiently utilize the supervision of aesthetic and semantic labels. A correlation item between these two tasks is further introduced to the framework by incorporating the inter-task relationship learning. This item not only provides some useful insight about the correlation but also improves assessment accuracy of the aesthetic task. Particularly, an effective strategy is developed to keep a balance between the two tasks, which facilitates to optimize the parameters of the framework. Extensive experiments on the challenging AVA dataset and Photo.net dataset validate the importance of semantic recognition in aesthetic quality assessment, and demonstrate that multi-task deep models can discover an effective aesthetic representation to achieve state-of-the-art results.

人类通常会评估图像的美学质量，并与图像的语义内容进行识别。本文讨论了自动审美质量评估与语义识别之间的关联问题。我们将评估问题作为多任务深层模型中的主要任务，认为语义识别任务为解决这个问题提供了关键。基于卷积神经网络，我们采用一个简单的多任务框架来有效地利用审美和语义标签的监督。通过结合任务间关系学习，将这两个任务之间的相关项目进一步引入框架。这个项目不仅提供了一些关于相关性的有用的见解，而且提高了审美任务的评估准确性。特别是为了保持两个任务之间的平衡，开发了一个有效的策略，有利于框架参数的优化。对具有挑战性的AVA数据集和Photo.net数据集的大量实验验证了语义识别在审美质量评估中的重要性，并证明多任务深层模型可以发现有效的审美表征，以达到最新的结果。
