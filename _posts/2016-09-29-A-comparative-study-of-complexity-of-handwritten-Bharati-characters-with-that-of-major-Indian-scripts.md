##### Abstract
We present Bharati, a simple, novel script that can represent the characters of a majority of contemporary Indian scripts. The shapes/motifs of Bharati characters are drawn from some of the simplest characters of existing Indian scripts. Bharati characters are designed such that they strictly reflect the underlying phonetic organization, thereby attributing to the script qualities of simplicity, familiarity, ease of acquisition and use. Thus, employing Bharati script as a common script for a majority of Indian languages can ameliorate several existing communication bottlenecks in India. We perform a complexity analysis of handwritten Bharati script and compare its complexity with that of 9 major Indian scripts. The measures of complexity are derived from a theory of handwritten characters based on Catastrophe theory. Bharati script is shown to be simpler than the 9 major Indian scripts in most measures of complexity.

我们呈现巴拉提，一个简单，新颖的脚本，可以代表大多数当代印度脚本的字符。巴拉提字符的形状/图案来自现有印度文字的一些最简单的字符。巴拉提字符的设计使得它们严格地反映了潜在的语音组织，从而归因于简单，熟悉，易于获取和使用的脚本素质。因此，使用巴拉提文字作为大多数印度语言的通用文字，可以改善印度现有的一些沟通瓶颈。我们对手写的Bharati脚本进行复杂性分析，并将其复杂度与9种主要的印度脚本进行比较。复杂性的度量是基于突变理论的手写字符理论推导出来的。在大多数复杂的度量标准中，Bharati脚本比9个主要的印度脚本简单。
