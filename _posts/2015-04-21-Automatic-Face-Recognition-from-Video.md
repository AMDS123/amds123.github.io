##### Abstract
The objective of this work is to automatically recognize faces from video sequences in a realistic, unconstrained setup in which illumination conditions are extreme and greatly changing, viewpoint and user motion pattern have a wide variability, and video input is of low quality. At the centre of focus are face appearance manifolds: this thesis presents a significant advance of their understanding and application in the sphere of face recognition. The two main contributions are the Generic Shape-Illumination Manifold recognition algorithm and the Anisotropic Manifold Space clustering. The Generic Shape-Illumination Manifold is evaluated on a large data corpus acquired in real-world conditions and its performance is shown to greatly exceed that of state-of-the-art methods in the literature and the best performing commercial software. Empirical evaluation of the Anisotropic Manifold Space clustering on a popular situation comedy is also described with excellent preliminary results.

这个工作的目的是在一个现实的，不受限制的设置中自动识别视频序列中的人脸，其中光照条件极端变化很大，视点和用户运动模式变化很大，视频输入质量低。焦点的中心是人脸识别流形：本文在人脸识别领域的理解和应用方面取得了重大进展。两个主要贡献是通用形状照明歧管识别算法和各向异性流形空间聚类。通用形状照明歧管是在现实世界中获得的大型数据语料库上评估的，其性能远远超过了文献中最先进的方法和最佳性能的商业软件。各向异性流形的经验评估对流行情景喜剧的空间聚类也有很好的初步结果。
