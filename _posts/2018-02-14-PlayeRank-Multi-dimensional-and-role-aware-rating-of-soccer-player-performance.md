##### Abstract
The problem of rating the performance of soccer players is attracting the interest of many companies, websites, and the scientific community, thanks to the availability of massive data capturing all the events generated during a game (e.g., tackles, passes, shots, etc.). Existing approaches fail to fully exploit the richness of the available data and lack of a proper validation. In this paper, we design and implement {\sf PlayeRank}, a data-driven framework that offers a principled multi-dimensional and role-aware evaluation of the performance of soccer players. We validate the framework through an experimental analysis advised by soccer experts, based on a massive dataset of millions of events pertaining four seasons of the five prominent European leagues. Experiments show that {\sf PlayeRank} is robust in agreeing with the experts' evaluation of players, significantly improving the state of the art. We also explore an application of PlayeRank --- i.e. searching players --- by introducing a special form of spatial query on the soccer field. This shows its flexibility and efficiency, which makes it worth to be used in the design of a scalable platform for soccer analytics.

评级足球球员的表现的问题是吸引了众多公司，网站的兴趣，而科学界，由于大量的数据采集产生的所有事件的可用性的比赛中（例如，铲球，传球，投篮等。 ）。现有方法无法充分利用现有数据的丰富性以及缺乏适当的验证。在本文中，我们设计并实现了{\ sf PlayeRank}，这是一个数据驱动的框架，它为足球运动员的表现提供了原则性的多维和角色感知评估。我们通过足球专家建议的实验分析验证了该框架，该分析基于数百万个与欧洲五大联赛中四个赛季相关的赛事数据。实验表明{\ sf PlayeRank}在赞同专家对球员的评价方面很有力，显着改善了艺术水平。我们还通过在足球场上引入特殊形式的空间查询来探索PlayeRank的应用---即搜索球员---。这显示了它的灵活性和效率，这使其值得用于足球分析的可扩展平台的设计。
