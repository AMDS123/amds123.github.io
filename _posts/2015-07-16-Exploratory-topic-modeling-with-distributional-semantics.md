##### Abstract
As we continue to collect and store textual data in a multitude of domains, we are regularly confronted with material whose largely unknown thematic structure we want to uncover. With unsupervised, exploratory analysis, no prior knowledge about the content is required and highly open-ended tasks can be supported. In the past few years, probabilistic topic modeling has emerged as a popular approach to this problem. Nevertheless, the representation of the latent topics as aggregations of semi-coherent terms limits their interpretability and level of detail. This paper presents an alternative approach to topic modeling that maps topics as a network for exploration, based on distributional semantics using learned word vectors. From the granular level of terms and their semantic similarity relations global topic structures emerge as clustered regions and gradients of concepts. Moreover, the paper discusses the visual interactive representation of the topic map, which plays an important role in supporting its exploration.

##### Abstract (translated by Google)
随着我们不断收集和存储多个领域的文本数据，我们经常遇到那些我们想要发现的主要未知主题结构的材料。通过无监督的探索性分析，不需要关于内容的先验知识，并且可以支持高度开放的任务。在过去的几年里，概率主题建模已经成为解决这个问题的一种流行方法。尽管如此，潜在话题作为半连贯术语集合的表述限制了他们的解释性和细节层次。本文提出了一种主题建模的替代方法，基于使用学习的单词向量的分布语义将主题映射为探索网络。从粒度层次上来看，语义相似关系是全局主题结构出现的聚集区域和概念梯度。此外，论文还讨论了主题图的视觉交互表示，这对于支持其探索起到了重要作用。
