##### Abstract
Local deep neural networks have been recently introduced for gender recognition. Although, they achieve very good performance they are very computationally expensive to train. In this work, we introduce a simplified version of local deep neural networks which significantly reduces the training time. Instead of using hundreds of patches per image, as suggested by the original method, we propose to use 9 overlapping patches per image which cover the entire face region. This results in a much reduced training time, since just 9 patches are extracted per image instead of hundreds, at the expense of a slightly reduced performance. We tested the proposed modified local deep neural networks approach on the LFW and Adience databases for the task of gender and age classification. For both tasks and both databases the performance is up to 1% lower compared to the original version of the algorithm. We have also investigated which patches are more discriminative for age and gender classification. It turns out that the mouth and eyes regions are useful for age classification, whereas just the eye region is useful for gender classification.

最近已经引入了局部深度神经网络用于性别识别。虽然他们取得了非常好的表现，但他们在计算上花费很高。在这项工作中，我们引入了局部深度神经网络的简化版本，大大缩短了训练时间。按照原始方法的建议，我们建议每个图像使用9个重叠的斑块，而不是每个图像使用数百个斑块，覆盖整个面部区域。这导致训练时间大大缩短，因为每个图像只提取了9个补丁而不是数百个补丁，代价是性能略有下降。我们在LFW和Adience数据库上测试了提出的改进的局部深度神经网络方法，用于性别和年龄分类任务。对于这两个任务和两个数据库，性能比算法的原始版本低1％。我们还调查了哪些补丁更加区分年龄和性别分类。事实证明，嘴和眼睛区域对于年龄分类是有用的，而眼睛区域对于性别分类是有用的。
