##### Abstract
We present a multilingual Named Entity Recognition approach based on a robust and general set of features across languages and datasets. Our system combines shallow local information with clustering semi-supervised features induced on large amounts of unlabeled text. Understanding via empirical experimentation how to effectively combine various types of clustering features allows us to seamlessly export our system to other datasets and languages. The result is a simple but highly competitive system which obtains state of the art results across five languages and twelve datasets. The results are reported on standard shared task evaluation data such as CoNLL for English, Spanish and Dutch. Furthermore, and despite the lack of linguistically motivated features, we also report best results for languages such as Basque and German. In addition, we demonstrate that our method also obtains very competitive results even when the amount of supervised data is cut by half, alleviating the dependency on manually annotated data. Finally, the results show that our emphasis on clustering features is crucial to develop robust out-of-domain models. The system and models are freely available to facilitate its use and guarantee the reproducibility of results.

我们提出了一种多语言命名实体识别方法，该方法基于跨语言和数据集的一组强大而通用的特征。我们的系统将浅层局部信息与在大量未标记文本上引起的聚类半监督特征相结合。通过经验实验了解如何有效地结合各种类型的聚类特征，使我们能够将我们的系统无缝地导出到其他数据集和语言。其结果是一个简单但高度竞争的系统，获得五种语言和十二个数据集的最先进的结果。结果以标准共享任务评估数据报告，例如英语，西班牙语和荷兰语的CoNLL。此外，尽管缺乏语言动机的特征，但我们也报告了巴斯克语和德语等语言的最佳结果。另外，我们证明了即使当监督数据量减少一半，我们的方法也获得了非常有竞争力的结果，减轻了对手动注释数据的依赖。最后，结果表明，我们强调聚类功能对于开发强大的域外模型至关重要。系统和模型可以免费使用，以方便使用，并保证结果的可重复性。
