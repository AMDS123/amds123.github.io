##### Abstract
Studying snake robot locomotion in a cluttered environment has been a complicated task because the motion model is discontinuous due to the physical contact with obstacles, and the contact force cannot be determined solely by contact positions. We present a unique mathematical model of the robot interacting with obstacles in which the contact forces are mapped on the basis of a viscous friction model. Also a motion planning strategy has been introduced which helps deriving the simplest path that ensures sufficient number of contacts of the robot with the obstacles required to reach a goal position. Numerical simulations and experimental results are presented to validate the theoretical approach.

在杂乱的环境中研究蛇机器人的运动一直是一项复杂的工作，因为运动模型由于与障碍物的物理接触而不连续，并且接触力不能仅由接触位置确定。我们提出了一个独特的机器人数学模型，与基于粘性摩擦模型的接触力映射的障碍物相互作用。还引入了运动计划策略，该策略有助于推导出最简单的路径，从而确保机器人具有足够数量的接触以及达到目标位置所需的障碍物。数值模拟和实验结果被提出来验证理论方法。
