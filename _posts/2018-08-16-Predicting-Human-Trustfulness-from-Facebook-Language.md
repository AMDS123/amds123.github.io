##### Abstract
Trustfulness -- one's general tendency to have confidence in unknown people or situations -- predicts many important real-world outcomes such as mental health and likelihood to cooperate with others such as clinicians. While data-driven measures of interpersonal trust have previously been introduced, here, we develop the first language-based assessment of the personality trait of trustfulness by fitting one's language to an accepted questionnaire-based trust score. Further, using trustfulness as a type of case study, we explore the role of questionnaire size as well as word count in developing language-based predictive models of users' psychological traits. We find that leveraging a longer questionnaire can yield greater test set accuracy, while, for training, we find it beneficial to include users who took smaller questionnaires which offers more observations for training. Similarly, after noting a decrease in individual prediction error as word count increased, we found a word count-weighted training scheme was helpful when there were very few users in the first place.

信任 - 一个人对未知的人或情况有信心的倾向 - 预测许多重要的现实世界结果，如心理健康和与临床医生等其他人合作的可能性。虽然之前已经引入了数据驱动的人际信任度量，但在这里，我们通过将一种语言与基于可接受的基于问卷的信任得分相匹配，开发出第一种基于语言的可信度人格特质评估。此外，使用可信度作为一种案例研究，我们探讨了问卷大小和字数在开发基于语言的用户心理特征预测模型中的作用。我们发现利用较长的问卷调查可以提高测试集的准确性，而对于培训，我们发现包含较小问卷的用户可以提供更多的培训观察结果。类似地，在注意到随着字数增加而个体预测误差减少之后，我们发现当一开始只有极少数用户时，字数加权训练方案是有用的。
