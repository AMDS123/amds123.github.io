##### Abstract
Owing to the large breakdown electric field, wide bandgap semiconductors such as SiC, GaN, Ga2O3 and diamond based power devices are the focus for next generation power switching applications. The unipolar trade-off relationship between the area specific-on resistance and breakdown voltage is often employed to compare the performance limitation among various materials. The GaN material system has a unique advantage due to its prominent spontaneous and piezoelectric polarization effects in GaN, AlN, InN, AlxInyGaN alloys and flexibility in inserting appropriate heterojunctions thus dramatically broaden the device design space.
