##### Abstract
In this dissertation, we present a generative model to capture the relation between facial image quality features (like pose, illumination direction, etc) and face recognition performance. Such a model can be used to predict the performance of a face recognition system. Since the model is based solely on image quality features, performance predictions can be done even before the actual recognition has taken place thereby facilitating many preemptive action. A practical limitation of such a data driven generative model is the limited nature of training data set. To address this limitation, we have developed a Bayesian approach to model the distribution of recognition performance measure based on the number of match and non-match scores in small regions of the image quality space. Random samples drawn from these models provide the initial data essential for training the generative model. Experiment results based on six face recognition systems operating on three independent data sets show that the proposed performance prediction model can accurately predict face recognition performance using an accurate and unbiased Image Quality Assessor (IQA). Furthermore, our results show that variability in the unaccounted quality space -- the image quality features not considered by the IQA -- is the major factor causing inaccuracies in predicted performance.

在本文中，我们提出了一个生成模型来捕捉面部图像质量特征（如姿态，照明方向等）与人脸识别性能之间的关系。这样的模型可以用来预测人脸识别系统的性能。由于该模型仅基于图像质量特征，所以甚至在实际识别发生之前就可以进行性能预测，从而促进许多先发制人的行动。这样的数据驱动的生成模型的实际限制是训练数据集的有限性质。为了解决这个局限性，我们开发了贝叶斯方法，根据图像质量空间的小区域中的匹配和不匹配得分来识别性能测量的分布。从这些模型中抽取的随机样本提供了培养生成模型所必需的初始数据。基于六个人脸识别系统在三个独立数据集上运行的实验结果表明，所提出的性能预测模型能够使用准确无误的图像质量评估器（IQA）准确预测人脸识别性能。此外，我们的研究结果表明，未考虑的质量空间（IQA未考虑的图像质量特征）的变化性是导致预测性能不准确的主要因素。
