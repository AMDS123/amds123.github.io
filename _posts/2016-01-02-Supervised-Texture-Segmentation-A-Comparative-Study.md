##### Abstract
This paper aims to compare between four different types of feature extraction approaches in terms of texture segmentation. The feature extraction methods that were used for segmentation are Gabor filters (GF), Gaussian Markov random fields (GMRF), run-length matrix (RLM) and co-occurrence matrix (GLCM). It was shown that the GF performed best in terms of quality of segmentation while the GLCM localises the texture boundaries better as compared to the other methods.

本文旨在比较四种不同类型的纹理分割特征提取方法。用于分割的特征提取方法有Gabor滤波器（GF），高斯马尔可夫随机场（GMRF），游程矩阵（RLM）和共生矩阵（GLCM）。结果表明，GF在分割质量方面表现最好，而GLCM则比其他方法更好地定位纹理边界。
