##### Abstract
This study aims to analyze the benefits of improved multi-scale reasoning for object detection and localization with deep convolutional neural networks. To that end, an efficient and general object detection framework which operates on scale volumes of a deep feature pyramid is proposed. In contrast to the proposed approach, most current state-of-the-art object detectors operate on a single-scale in training, while testing involves independent evaluation across scales. One benefit of the proposed approach is in better capturing of multi-scale contextual information, resulting in significant gains in both detection performance and localization quality of objects on the PASCAL VOC dataset and a multi-view highway vehicles dataset. The joint detection and localization scale-specific models are shown to especially benefit detection of challenging object categories which exhibit large scale variation as well as detection of small objects.

本研究旨在分析改进的多尺度推理对深度卷积神经网络的目标检测和定位的好处。为此，提出了一个高效的通用对象检测框架，该框架在一个深度特征金字塔的规模量上运行。与所提出的方法相反，大多数当前的最先进的物体检测器在训练中以单一尺度运行，而测试涉及跨尺度的独立评估。所提出的方法的一个好处是更好地捕获多尺度上下文信息，从而在PASCAL VOC数据集和多视图公路车辆数据集上的对象的检测性能和本地化质量上获得显着的收益。联合检测和本地化规模特定的模型被显示为特别有益于检测具有大规模变化的挑战性对象类别以及检测小物体。
