##### Abstract
We propose a task to generate a complex sentence from a simple sentence in order to amplify various kinds of responses in the database. We first divide a complex sentence into a main clause and a subordinate clause to learn a generator model of modifiers, and then use the model to generate a modifier clause to create a complex sentence from a simple sentence. We present an automatic evaluation metric to estimate the quality of the models and show that a pipeline model outperforms an end-to-end model.
