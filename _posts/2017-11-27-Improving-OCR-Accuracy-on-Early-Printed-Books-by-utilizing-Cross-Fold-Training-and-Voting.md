##### Abstract
In this paper we introduce a method that significantly reduces the character error rates for OCR text obtained from OCRopus models trained on early printed books. The method uses a combination of cross fold training and confidence based voting. After allocating the available ground truth in different subsets several training processes are performed, each resulting in a specific OCR model. The OCR text generated by these models then gets voted to determine the final output by taking the recognized characters, their alternatives, and the confidence values assigned to each character into consideration. Experiments on seven early printed books show that the proposed method outperforms the standard approach considerably by reducing the amount of errors by up to 50% and more.

在本文中，我们介绍一种方法，可以显着降低从早期印刷书籍培训的OCRopus模型获得的OCR文本的字符错误率。该方法使用交叉叠加训练和基于置信度投票的组合。在不同子集中分配可用的基本事实之后，执行几个训练过程，每个训练过程导致特定的OCR模型。然后通过这些模型生成的OCR文本被投票决定最终的输出，将识别的字符，它们的选择以及赋予每个字符的置信值考虑在内。在早期的七本书上进行的实验表明，所提出的方法通过将误差减少50％甚至更多，显着地超过了标准方法。
