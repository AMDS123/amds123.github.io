##### Abstract
In this paper an equalization technique for colour images is introduced. The method is based on nth root and nth power equalization approach but with optimization of the mean of the image in different colour channels such as RGB and HSI. The performance of the proposed method has been measured by the means of peak signal to noise ratio. The proposed algorithm has been compared with conventional histogram equalization and the visual and quantitative experimental results are showing that the proposed method over perform the histogram equalization.

本文介绍了彩色图像的均衡技术。该方法基于第n根和第n功率均衡方法，但是在RGB和HSI等不同颜色通道中对图像的均值进行优化。所提出的方法的性能已经通过峰值信噪比的方法来测量。将该算法与传统的直方图均衡算法进行了比较，实验结果表明所提出的算法均优于直方图均衡算法。
