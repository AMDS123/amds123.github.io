##### Abstract
Human domain experts solve difficult planning problems by drawing on years of experience. In many cases, computing a solution to such problems is computationally intractable or requires encoding heuristics from human domain experts. As codifying this knowledge leaves much to be desired, we aim to infer their strategies through observation. The challenge lies in that humans exhibit heterogeneity in their latent decision-making criteria. To overcome this, we propose a personalized apprenticeship learning framework that automatically infers a representation of all human task demonstrators by extracting a human-specific embedding. Our framework is built on a propositional architecture that allows for distilling an interpretable representation of each human demonstrator's decision-making.
