##### Abstract
This paper describes our approach on Query Word Labeling as an attempt in the shared task on Mixed Script Information Retrieval at Forum for Information Retrieval Evaluation (FIRE) 2015. The query is written in Roman script and the words were in English or transliterated from Indian regional languages. A total of eight Indian languages were present in addition to English. We also identified the Named Entities and special symbols as part of our task. A CRF based machine learning framework was used for labeling the individual words with their corresponding language labels. We used a dictionary based approach for language identification. We also took into account the context of the word while identifying the language. Our system demonstrated an overall accuracy of 75.5% for token level language identification. The strict F-measure scores for the identification of token level language labels for Bengali, English and Hindi are 0.7486, 0.892 and 0.7972 respectively. The overall weighted F-measure of our system was 0.7498.

本文将我们的查询词标签方法描述为在2015年信息检索评估论坛（FIRE）的混合脚本信息检索共享​​任务中的一种尝试。查询用罗马字母书写，单词用英文或印度地区语言。除英语外，还有八种印度语。我们还确定了命名实体和特殊符号作为我们任务的一部分。基于CRF的机器学习框架被用于标记单个词以及它们对应的语言标签。我们使用了基于字典的方法进行语言识别。在识别语言的同时，我们也考虑了这个词的上下文。我们的系统对令牌级语言标识的整体准确率达到了75.5％。孟加拉语，英语和印度语的标记语言标签的严格F-measure分数分别为0.7486,0.892和0.7972。我们系统的总体加权F-measure是0.7498。
