##### Abstract
An approach to make text visually appealing and memorable is semantic reinforcement - the use of visual cues alluding to the context or theme in which the word is being used to reinforce the message (e.g., Google Doodles). We present a computational approach for semantic reinforcement called TReAT - Thematic Reinforcement for Artistic Typography. Given an input word (e.g. exam) and a theme (e.g. education), the individual letters of the input word are replaced by cliparts relevant to the theme which visually resemble the letters - adding creative context to the potentially boring input word. We use an unsupervised approach to learn a latent space to represent letters and cliparts and compute similarities between the two. Human studies show that participants can reliably recognize the word as well as the theme in our outputs (TReATs) and find them more creative compared to meaningful baselines.
