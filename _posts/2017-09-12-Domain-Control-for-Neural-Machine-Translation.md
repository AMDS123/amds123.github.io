##### Abstract
Machine translation systems are very sensitive to the domains they were trained on. Several domain adaptation techniques have been deeply studied. We propose a new technique for neural machine translation (NMT) that we call domain control which is performed at runtime using a unique neural network covering multiple domains. The presented approach shows quality improvements when compared to dedicated domains translating on any of the covered domains and even on out-of-domain data. In addition, model parameters do not need to be re-estimated for each domain, making this effective to real use cases. Evaluation is carried out on English-to-French translation for two different testing scenarios. We first consider the case where an end-user performs translations on a known domain. Secondly, we consider the scenario where the domain is not known and predicted at the sentence level before translating. Results show consistent accuracy improvements for both conditions.

机器翻译系统对他们接受培训的领域非常敏感。几个领域的适应技术已深入研究。我们提出了一种神经机器翻译（NMT）的新技术，我们称之为域控制，在运行时使用覆盖多个域的独特的神经网络。所提出的方法显示了与在任何所涵盖域上甚至在域外数据上进行翻译的专用域相比的质量改进。另外，模型参数不需要为每个域重新估计，这对真实的使用情况是有效的。对两种不同测试场景的英文到法文翻译进行评估。我们首先考虑最终用户在已知域上执行翻译的情况。其次，我们考虑翻译前在句子层次上未知和预测域的场景。结果显示两个条件的一致的准确度改进。
