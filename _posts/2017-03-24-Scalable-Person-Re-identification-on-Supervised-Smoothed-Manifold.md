##### Abstract
Most existing person re-identification algorithms either extract robust visual features or learn discriminative metrics for person images. However, the underlying manifold which those images reside on is rarely investigated. That raises a problem that the learned metric is not smooth with respect to the local geometry structure of the data manifold. In this paper, we study person re-identification with manifold-based affinity learning, which did not receive enough attention from this area. An unconventional manifold-preserving algorithm is proposed, which can 1) make the best use of supervision from training data, whose label information is given as pairwise constraints; 2) scale up to large repositories with low on-line time complexity; and 3) be plunged into most existing algorithms, serving as a generic postprocessing procedure to further boost the identification accuracies. Extensive experimental results on five popular person re-identification benchmarks consistently demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. Especially, on the largest CUHK03 and Market-1501, our method outperforms the state-of-the-art alternatives by a large margin with high efficiency, which is more appropriate for practical applications.

大多数现有的人重新识别算法要么提取健壮的视觉特征，要么学习人脸图像的辨别度量。然而，这些图像所在的底层流派很少被调查。这就产生了一个问题，就是学习的度量关于数据流形的局部几何结构是不平滑的。在本文中，我们研究了基于流形的亲和力学习的人重新识别，但没有得到足够的关注。提出了一种非常规流形保持算法，该算法能够：1）充分利用训练数据的监督性，其标签信息为成对约束; 2）以较低的在线时间复杂度扩展到大型存储库;和3）陷入大多数现有的算法，作为一个通用的后处理程序，以进一步提高识别的准确性。五个流行的人重新识别基准的广泛的实验结果一致证明了我们的方法的有效性。特别是在最大的CUHK03和Market-1501上，我们的方法大大优于现有技术，效率高，更适合实际应用。
