##### Abstract
Colombia has a privileged geographical location which makes it a cornerstone and equidistant point to all regional markets. The country has a great ecological diversity and it is one of the largest suppliers of flowers for US. Colombian flower companies have made innovations in the marketing process, using methods to reach all conditions for final consumers. This article develops a monitoring system for floriculture industries. The system was implemented in a robotic platform. This device has the ability to be programmed in different programming languages. The robot takes the necessary environment information from its camera. The algorithm of the monitoring system was developed with the image processing toolbox on Matlab. The implemented algorithm acquires images through its camera, it performs a preprocessing of the image, noise filter, enhancing of the color and adjusting the dimension in order to increase processing speed. Then, the image is segmented by color and with the binarized version of the image using morphological operations (erosion and dilation), extract relevant features such as centroid, perimeter and area. The data obtained from the image processing helps the robot with the automatic identification of objectives, orientation and move towards them. Also, the results generate a diagnostic quality of each object scanned.

哥伦比亚具有优越的地理位置，使其成为所有区域市场的基石和等距点。这个国家生态多样，是美国最大的鲜花供应商之一。哥伦比亚的花卉公司已经在营销过程中进行创新，使用方法来达到最终消费者的所有条件。本文开发了花卉产业监测系统。该系统在一个机器人平台上实施。该器件能够以不同的编程语言进行编程。机器人从相机中获取必要的环境信息。该监控系统的算法是利用Matlab上的图像处理工具箱开发的。实现的算法通过摄像头获取图像，对图像进行预处理，噪声滤波，提高颜色和调整尺寸，以提高处理速度。然后，使用形态学操作（侵蚀和膨胀），通过颜色和图像的二值化版本来分割图像，提取诸如质心，周长和面积的相关特征。从图像处理获得的数据有助于机器人自动识别物体，方向并向其移动。此外，结果还会生成每个扫描对象的诊断质量。
