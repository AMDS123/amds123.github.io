##### Abstract
The risks and perils of overfitting in machine learning are well known. However most of the treatment of this, including diagnostic tools and remedies, was developed for the supervised learning case. In this work, we aim to offer new perspectives on the characterization and prevention of overfitting in deep Reinforcement Learning (RL) methods, with a particular focus on continuous domains. We examine several aspects, such as how to define and diagnose overfitting in MDPs, and how to reduce risks by injecting sufficient training diversity. This work complements recent findings on the brittleness of deep RL methods and offers practical observations for RL researchers and practitioners.

机器学习中过度拟合的风险和危险是众所周知的。然而，这些治疗的大部分，包括诊断工具和补救措施，都是为监督学习案例而开发的。在这项工作中，我们的目标是提供关于深度强化学习（RL）方法中过拟合的表征和预防的新视角，特别关注连续域。我们研究了几个方面，例如如何定义和诊断MDP中的过度拟合，以及如何通过注入足够的培训多样性来降低风险。这项工作补充了最近关于深RL方法脆性的发现，并为RL研究人员和从业者提供了实际观察结果。
