##### Abstract
In this study, a novel computer aided diagnosis (CADx) framework is devised to investigate interpretability for classifying breast masses. Recently, a deep learning technology has been successfully applied to medical image analysis including CADx. Existing deep learning based CADx approaches, however, have a limitation in explaining the diagnostic decision. In real clinical practice, clinical decisions could be made with reasonable explanation. So current deep learning approaches in CADx are limited in real world deployment. In this paper, we investigate interpretability in CADx with the proposed interpretable CADx (ICADx) framework. The proposed framework is devised with a generative adversarial network, which consists of interpretable diagnosis network and synthetic lesion generative network to learn the relationship between malignancy and a standardized description (BI-RADS). The lesion generative network and the interpretable diagnosis network compete in an adversarial learning so that the two networks are improved. The effectiveness of the proposed method was validated on public mammogram database. Experimental results showed that the proposed ICADx framework could provide the interpretability of mass as well as mass classification. It was mainly attributed to the fact that the proposed method was effectively trained to find the relationship between malignancy and interpretations via the adversarial learning. These results imply that the proposed ICADx framework could be a promising approach to develop the CADx system.

在这项研究中，设计了一种新颖的计算机辅助诊断（CADx）框架来研究乳腺肿块分类的可解释性。最近，深度学习技术已成功应用于包括CADx在内的医学图像分析。然而，现有的基于深度学习的CADx方法在解释诊断决策方面存在限制。在实际临床实践中，临床决策可以合理解释。因此，CADx当前的深度学习方法在实际部署中受到限制。在本文中，我们调查CADx中可解释性CADx（ICADx）框架的可解释性。提出的框架设计了一个生成对抗网络，该网络由可解释的诊断网络和合成病变生成网络组成，以了解恶性肿瘤与标准化描述（BI-RADS）之间的关系。病变生成网络和可解释的诊断网络在对抗性学习中竞争，使得两个网络得到改善。所提出的方法的有效性在公共乳房X线照片数据库上得到验证。实验结果表明，提出的ICADx框架可以提供质量和质量分类的可解释性。这主要归因于所提出的方法经过有效训练以通过敌对性学习来发现恶性肿瘤与解释之间的关系。这些结果意味着提议的ICADx框架可能是开发CADx系统的一种有前途的方法。
