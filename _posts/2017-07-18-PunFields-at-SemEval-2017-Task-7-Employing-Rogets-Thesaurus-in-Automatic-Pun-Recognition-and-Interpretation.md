##### Abstract
The article describes a model of automatic interpretation of English puns, based on Roget's Thesaurus, and its implementation, PunFields. In a pun, the algorithm discovers two groups of words that belong to two main semantic fields. The fields become a semantic vector based on which an SVM classifier learns to recognize puns. A rule-based model is then applied for recognition of intentionally ambiguous (target) words and their definitions. In SemEval Task 7 PunFields shows a considerably good result in pun classification, but requires improvement in searching for the target word and its definition.

##### Abstract (translated by Google)
本文介绍了一个基于Roget's Thesaurus的英语双关语自动解释模型及其实现，PunFields。在一个双关语中，算法发现属于两个主要语义领域的两组词。这些字段成为SVM分类器学习识别双关语的语义向量。然后，基于规则的模型被应用于识别有意模棱两可的（目标）单词及其定义。在SemEval任务7中PunFields在pun分类中显示出相当好的结果，但是在搜索目标词及其定义时需要改进。
