##### Abstract
The revolutionary developments in the field of supervised machine learning have paved way to the development of CAD tools for assisting doctors in diagnosis. Recently, the former has been employed in the prediction of neurological disorders such as Alzheimer's disease. We propose a CAD (Computer Aided Diagnosis tool for differentiating neural lesions caused by CVA (Cerebrovascular Accident) from the lesions caused by other neural disorders by using Non-negative Matrix Factorisation (NMF) and Haralick features for feature extraction and SVM (Support Vector Machine) for pattern recognition. We also introduce a multi-level classification system that has better classification efficiency, sensitivity and specificity when compared to systems using NMF or Haralick features alone as features for classification. Cross-validation was performed using LOOCV (Leave-One-Out Cross Validation) method and our proposed system has a classification accuracy of over 86%.

有监督机器学习领域的革命性发展为辅助医生诊断的CAD工具的发展铺平了道路。最近，前者已被用于预测阿尔茨海默病等神经系统疾病。我们提出了一种计算机辅助诊断工具，通过使用非负矩阵分解（NMF）和Haralick特征用于特征提取和SVM（支持向量机）来区分由其他神经病引起的病变引起的CVA（脑血管意外）引起的神经损伤）进行模式识别，同时引入多级分类系统，与单独使用NMF或Haralick特征作为分类特征的分类系统相比，具有更好的分类效率，灵敏度和特异性，使用LOOCV（Leave-One- Out Cross Validation）方法，我们提出的系统的分类精度超过86％。
