##### Abstract
3D object detection is still an open problem in autonomous driving scenes. When recognizing and localizing key objects from sparse 3D inputs, autonomous vehicles suffer from a larger continuous searching space and higher fore-background imbalance compared to image-based object detection. In this paper, we aim to solve this fore-background imbalance in 3D object detection. Inspired by the recent use of focal loss in image-based object detection, we extend this hard-mining improvement of binary cross entropy to point-cloud-based object detection and conduct experiments to show its performance based on two different 3D detectors: 3D-FCN and VoxelNet. The evaluation results show up to 11.2AP gains through the focal loss in a wide range of hyperparameters for 3D object detection.
