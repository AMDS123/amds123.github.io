##### Abstract
Attacks to networks are becoming more complex and sophisticated every day. Beyond the so-called script-kiddies and hacking newbies, there is a myriad of professional attackers seeking to make serious profits infiltrating in corporate networks. Either hostile governments, big corporations or mafias are constantly increasing their resources and skills in cybercrime in order to spy, steal or cause damage more effectively. traditional approaches to Network Security seem to start hitting their limits and it is being recognized the need for a smarter approach to threat detections. This paper provides an introduction on the need for evolution of Cyber Security techniques and how Artificial Intelligence could be of application to help solving some of the problems. It provides also, a high-level overview of some state of the art AI Network Security techniques, to finish analysing what is the foreseeable future of the application of AI to Network Security.

##### Abstract (translated by Google)
对网络的攻击每天都变得越来越复杂和复杂。除了所谓的脚本小子和黑客新手之外，还有无数的专业攻击者试图在企业网络中渗透严重的利润。无论是敌对政府，大公司还是黑社会，都不断增加网络犯罪的资源和技能，以便更有效地窥探，窃取或造成损害。传统的网络安全方法似乎开始受到限制，并且人们正在认识到需要采用更智能的方法来检测威胁。本文介绍了网络安全技术发展的必要性以及人工智能如何应用于解决某些问题。它还提供了对一些最先进的AI网络安全技术的高级概述，以完成分析人工智能在网络安全中的应用前景。
