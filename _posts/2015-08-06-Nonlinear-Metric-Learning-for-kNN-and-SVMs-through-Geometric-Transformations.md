##### Abstract
In recent years, research efforts to extend linear metric learning models to handle nonlinear structures have attracted great interests. In this paper, we propose a novel nonlinear solution through the utilization of deformable geometric models to learn spatially varying metrics, and apply the strategy to boost the performance of both kNN and SVM classifiers. Thin-plate splines (TPS) are chosen as the geometric model due to their remarkable versatility and representation power in accounting for high-order deformations. By transforming the input space through TPS, we can pull same-class neighbors closer while pushing different-class points farther away in kNN, as well as make the input data points more linearly separable in SVMs. Improvements in the performance of kNN classification are demonstrated through experiments on synthetic and real world datasets, with comparisons made with several state-of-the-art metric learning solutions. Our SVM-based models also achieve significant improvements over traditional linear and kernel SVMs with the same datasets.

近年来，扩展线性度量学习模型以处理非线性结构的研究引起了极大的兴趣。在本文中，我们提出了一种新颖的非线性解决方案，通过利用可变形的几何模型来学习空间变化的度量，并应用该策略来提高kNN和SVM分类器的性能。薄板花键（TPS）被选为几何模型，由于其显着的多功能性和表现力，以解决高阶变形。通过TPS对输入空间进行变换，可以将同类邻居拉近，同时将不同类别的点推到更远的地方，并使输入数据点在支持向量机中更加线性分离。通过对合成和现实世界数据集的实验，证明了kNN分类性能的改进，并与几种最先进的度量学习解决方案进行了比较。我们的基于SVM的模型在相同的数据集上也比传统的线性和核心SVM有显着的改进。
