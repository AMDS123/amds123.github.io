##### Abstract
In this paper we explore two ways of using context for object detection. The first model focusses on people and the objects they commonly interact with, such as fashion and sports accessories. The second model considers more general object detection and uses the spatial relationships between objects and between objects and scenes. Our models are able to capture precise spatial relationships between the context and the object of interest, and make effective use of the appearance of the contextual region. On the newly released COCO dataset, our models provide relative improvements of up to 5% over CNN-based state-of-the-art detectors, with the gains concentrated on hard cases such as small objects (10% relative improvement).

##### Abstract (translated by Google)
在本文中，我们探讨了使用上下文进行对象检测的两种方法。第一个模型着重于人物和他们通常与之互动的对象，比如时尚和运动配饰。第二个模型考虑更一般的对象检测，并使用对象之间以及对象与场景之间的空间关系。我们的模型能够捕捉上下文和感兴趣对象之间精确的空间关系，并有效利用上下文区域的外观。在新发布的COCO数据集上，我们的模型比基于CNN的最先进的探测器提供高达5％的相对改进，增益集中在诸如小物体（相对改进10％）的硬件情况。
