##### Abstract
We report a realization of an associative memory signal/information processing system based on simple enzyme-catalyzed biochemical reactions. Optically detected chemical output is always obtained in response to the triggering input, but the system can also "learn" by association, to later respond to the second input if it is initially applied in combination with the triggering input as the "training" step. This second chemical input is not self-reinforcing in the present system, which therefore can later "unlearn" to react to the second input if it is applied several times on its own. Such processing steps realized with (bio)chemical kinetics promise applications of bio-inspired/memory-involving components in "networked" (concatenated) biomolecular processes for multi-signal sensing and complex information processing.

我们报告了基于简单的酶催化生化反应的联想记忆信号/信息处理系统的实现。光学检测的化学输出总是响应于触发输入而获得，但是系统也可以通过关联“学习”，以便稍后响应第二输入，如果其最初与触发输入一起应用作为“训练”步骤。本系统中的第二个化学输入不是自我加强的，因此如果它自己应用了多次，它可以稍后“忘掉”对第二个输入作出反应。用（生物）化学动力学实现的这样的处理步骤允许在“联网”（连接的）生物分子过程中用于多信号感测和复杂信息处理的生物启发/记忆涉及组件的应用。
