##### Abstract
We discuss the geometry of rational maps from a projective space of an arbitrary dimension to the product of projective spaces of lower dimensions induced by linear projections. In particular, we give a purely algebro-geometric proof of the projective reconstruction theorem by Hartley and Schaffalitzky [HS09].
