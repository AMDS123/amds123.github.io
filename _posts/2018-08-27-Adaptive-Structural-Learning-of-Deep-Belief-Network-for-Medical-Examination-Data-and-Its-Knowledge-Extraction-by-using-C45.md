##### Abstract
Deep Learning has a hierarchical network architecture to represent the complicated feature of input patterns. The adaptive structural learning method of Deep Belief Network (DBN) has been developed. The method can discover an optimal number of hidden neurons for given input data in a Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM) by neuron generation-annihilation algorithm, and generate a new hidden layer in DBN by the extension of the algorithm. In this paper, the proposed adaptive structural learning of DBN was applied to the comprehensive medical examination data for the cancer prediction. The prediction system shows higher classification accuracy (99.8% for training and 95.5% for test) than the traditional DBN. Moreover, the explicit knowledge with respect to the relation between input and output patterns was extracted from the trained DBN network by C4.5. Some characteristics extracted in the form of IF-THEN rules to find an initial cancer at the early stage were reported in this paper.

Deep Learning具有分层网络架构来表示输入模式的复杂特征。开发了深度信念网络（DBN）的自适应结构学习方法。该方法可以通过神经元生成 - 湮灭算法在受限玻尔兹曼机（RBM）中发现给定输入数据的最佳隐藏神经元数，并通过算法的扩展在DBN中生成新的隐藏层。本文将DBN的自适应结构学习应用于癌症预测的综合医学检查数据。与传统的DBN相比，预测系统显示出更高的分类准确率（培训为99.8％，测试为95.5％）。此外，C4.5从训练有素的DBN网络中提取了关于输入和输出模式之间关系的显式知识。本文报道了以IF-THEN规则形式提取的一些特征，以便在早期发现初始癌症。
