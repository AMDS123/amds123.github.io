##### Abstract
Learning generalizable skills in robotic manipulation has long been challenging due to real-world sized observation and action spaces. One method for addressing this problem is attention focus -- the robot learns where to attend its sensors and irrelevant details are ignored. However, these methods have largely not caught on due to the difficulty of learning a good attention policy and the added partial observability induced by a narrowed window of focus. This article addresses the first issue by constraining gazes to a spatial hierarchy. For the second issue, we identify a case where the partial observability induced by attention does not prevent Q-learning from finding an optimal policy. We conclude with real-robot experiments on challenging pick-place tasks demonstrating the applicability of the approach.
