##### Abstract
The goal of formalization, proposed in this paper, is to bring together, as near as possible, the theoretic linguistic problem of synonym conception and the computer linguistic methods based generally on empirical intuitive unjustified factors. Using the word vector representation we have proposed the geometric approach to mathematical modeling of synonym set (synset). The word embedding is based on the neural networks (Skip-gram, CBOW), developed and realized as word2vec program by T. Mikolov. The standard cosine similarity is used as the distance between word-vectors. Several geometric characteristics of the synset words are introduced: the interior of synset, the synset word rank and centrality. These notions are intended to select the most significant synset words, i.e. the words which senses are the nearest to the sense of a synset. Some experiments with proposed notions, based on RusVectores resources, are represented. A brief description of this work can be viewed in slides https://goo.gl/K82Fei

##### Abstract (translated by Google)
本文提出的形式化的目标是尽可能地将同义词概念的理论语言学问题和基于经验直观的不合理因素的计算机语言学方法汇集在一起​​。使用词向量表示，我们提出了同义词集（synset）的数学建模的几何方法。词嵌入基于神经网络（Skip-gram，CBOW），由T. Mikolov开发并实现为word2vec程序。标准的余弦相似度被用作单词向量之间的距离。引入同义词的几个几何特征：同义词的内部，同义词的等级和中心性。这些概念旨在选择最重要的同义词，即意义上最接近同义词的词。代表了基于RusVectores资源提出的一些概念实验。这项工作的简要说明可以在幻灯片https://goo.gl/K82Fei中查看
