##### Abstract
In the analysis of acoustic scenes, often the occurring sounds have to be detected in time, recognized, and localized in space. Usually, each of these tasks is done separately. In this paper, a model-based approach to jointly carry them out for the case of multiple simultaneous sources is presented and tested. The recognized event classes and their respective room positions are obtained with a single system that maximizes the combination of a large set of scores, each one resulting from a different acoustic event model and a different beamformer output signal, which comes from one of several arbitrarily-located small microphone arrays. By using a two-step method, the experimental work for a specific scenario consisting of meeting-room acoustic events, either isolated or overlapped with speech, is reported. Tests carried out with two datasets show the advantage of the proposed approach with respect to some usual techniques, and that the inclusion of estimated priors brings a further performance improvement.

在声场分析中，发生的声音往往必须及时检测，识别，并在空间局部化。通常，这些任务中的每一个都是分开完成的。本文提出并测试了一个基于模型的方法来共同执行多个同时来源的情况。所识别的事件类别及其各自的房间位置是通过单一系统获得的，所述系统最大化了大量分数的组合，每个分数来自不同的声音事件模型和不同的波束形成器输出信号，位于小型麦克风阵列。通过使用两步法，报告了由会议室声学事件组成的特定场景的实验性工作，不管是与语音隔离还是与语音重叠。用两个数据集进行的测试显示了所提出的方法相对于一些常用技术的优点，并且包含估计的先验数据带来了进一步的性能改进。
