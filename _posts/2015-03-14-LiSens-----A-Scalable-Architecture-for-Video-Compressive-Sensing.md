##### Abstract
The measurement rate of cameras that take spatially multiplexed measurements by using spatial light modulators (SLM) is often limited by the switching speed of the SLMs. This is especially true for single-pixel cameras where the photodetector operates at a rate that is many orders-of-magnitude greater than the SLM. We study the factors that determine the measurement rate for such spatial multiplexing cameras (SMC) and show that increasing the number of pixels in the device improves the measurement rate, but there is an optimum number of pixels (typically, few thousands) beyond which the measurement rate does not increase. This motivates the design of LiSens, a novel imaging architecture, that replaces the photodetector in the single-pixel camera with a 1D linear array or a line-sensor. We illustrate the optical architecture underlying LiSens, build a prototype, and demonstrate results of a range of indoor and outdoor scenes. LiSens delivers on the promise of SMCs: imaging at a megapixel resolution, at video rate, using an inexpensive low-resolution sensor.

通过使用空间光调制器（SLM）进行空间复用测量的摄像机的测量速率通常受到SLM的切换速度的限制。对于光电探测器以比SLM高出几个数量级的速率工作的单像素相机尤其如此。我们研究了决定这种空间多路复用摄像机（SMC）的测量速率的因素，并且表明增加设备中像素的数量提高了测量速率，但是存在最佳数量的像素（通常为数千）测量速度不增加。这激发了一种新颖的成像架构LiSens的设计，它用一维线性阵列或线阵传感器代替了单像素相机中的光电探测器。我们展示了LiSens的光学架构，构建了一个原型，并演示了一系列室内和室外场景的结果。 LiSens实现了SMC的承诺：使用便宜的低分辨率传感器，以百万像素分辨率，以视频速率成像。
