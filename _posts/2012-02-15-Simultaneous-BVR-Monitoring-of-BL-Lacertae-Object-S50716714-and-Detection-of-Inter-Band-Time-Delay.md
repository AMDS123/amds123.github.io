##### Abstract
We present the results of our optical monitoring of the BL Lac object S5 0716+714 on seven nights in 2006 December. The monitoring was carried out simultaneously at three optical wavelengths with a novel photometric system. The object did not show large-amplitude internight variations during this period. Intranight variations were observed on four nights and probably on one more. Strong bluer-when-brighter chromatism was detected on both intranight and internight timescales. The intranight variation amplitude decreases in the wavelength sequence of B', R', and V'. Cross correlation analyses revealed that the variability at the $B'$ and $V'$ bands lead that at the $R'$ band by about 30 minutes on one night.

我们在2006年12月的七晚上展示了BL Lac物体S5 0716 + 714的光学监测结果。用一种新颖的光度测量系统在三个光学波长同时进行监测。在这段时间里，这个物体并没有表现出大振幅的变化。在四个晚上观察到了大小差异，可能还有一个。在夜间和夜间时间尺度上检测到更强烈的蓝色更强的色差。在B'，R'和V'的波长序列中，夜间变化幅度减小。互相关分析显示，$ B'$和$ V'$波段的波动导致在$ R'$波段在一个晚上大约30分钟。
