##### Abstract
This paper presents a novel multi-task learning-based method for unsupervised domain adaptation. Specifically, the source and target domain classifiers are jointly learned by considering the geometry of target domain and the divergence between the source and target domains based on the concept of multi-task learning. Two novel algorithms are proposed upon the method using Regularized Least Squares and Support Vector Machines respectively. Experiments on both synthetic and real world cross domain recognition tasks have shown that the proposed methods outperform several state-of-the-art domain adaptation methods.

##### Abstract (translated by Google)
本文提出了一种新的基于多任务学习的无监督域自适应方法。具体而言，基于多任务学习的概念，通过考虑目标域的几何学和源域与目标域之间的差异来共同学习源域和目标域分类器。提出了两种基于正则化最小二乘支持向量机的新算法。对合成和现实世界交叉领域识别任务的实验表明，所提出的方法胜过了几种最先进的领域自适应方法。
