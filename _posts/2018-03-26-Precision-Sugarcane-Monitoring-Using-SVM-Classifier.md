##### Abstract
India is agriculture based economy and sugarcane is one of the major crops produced in northern India. Productivity of sugarcane decreases due to inappropriate soil conditions and infections caused by various types of diseases , timely and accurate disease diagnosis, plays an important role towards optimizing crop yield. This paper presents a system model for monitoring of sugarcane crop, the proposed model continuously monitor parameters (temperature, humidity and moisture) responsible for healthy growth of the crop in addition KNN clustering along with SVM classifier is utilized for infection identification if any through images obtained at regular intervals. The data has been transmitted wirelessly from the site to the control unit. Model achieves an accuracy of 96% on a sample of 200 images, the model was tested at Lolai, near Malhaur, Gomti Nagar Extension.

印度是以农业为基础的经济体，甘蔗是印度北部生产的主要农作物之一。由于不适当的土壤条件和各种疾病引起的感染，及时准确的疾病诊断，甘蔗生产力下降，对优化作物产量起着重要作用。本文提出了监测甘蔗作物的系统模型，该模型连续监测作物的健康生长所需的参数（温度，湿度和湿度），此外KNN聚类与支持向量机分类器一起用于感染识别，定期进行。数据已经从现场无线传输到控制单元。模型在200幅图像样本上实现了96％的准确性，该模型在位于Gomti Nagar Extension的Malhaur附近的Lolai进行了测试。
