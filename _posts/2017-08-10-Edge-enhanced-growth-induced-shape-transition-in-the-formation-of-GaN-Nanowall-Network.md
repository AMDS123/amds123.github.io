##### Abstract
We address the mechanism of early stages of growth and shape transition of the unique nanowall network (NwN) nanostructure of GaN by experimentally monitoring its controlled growth using PA-MBE and complementing it by \textit{first-principles} calculations. Using electron microscopy, we observe the formation of tetrahedron shaped (3 faced pyramid) islands at early stages of growth, which later grows anisotropically along their edges of the (20$\overline{2}$1) facets, to form the wall like structure. The mechanism of this crystal growth is discussed in light of surface free energies of the different surfaces, adsorption energy and diffusion barrier of Ga ad-atoms on the (20$\overline{2}$1) facets. By \textit{first-principles} calculations, we find that the diffusion barrier of ad-atoms decreases with decreasing width of facets, and is responsible for the anisotropic growth and formation of the nanowall network. This study suggest that formation of NwN is a archetype example of structure dependent attachment kinetic (SDAK) instability induced shape transition in thin film growth.
