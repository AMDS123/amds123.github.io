##### Abstract
This paper demonstrates the effectiveness of our customized deep learning based video analytics system in various applications focused on security, safety, customer analytics and process compliance. We describe our video analytics system comprising of Search, Summarize, Statistics and real-time alerting, and outline its building blocks. These building blocks include object detection, tracking, face detection and recognition, human and face sub-attribute analytics. In each case, we demonstrate how custom models trained using data from the deployment scenarios provide considerably superior accuracies than off-the-shelf models. Towards this end, we describe our data processing and model training pipeline, which can train and fine-tune models from videos with a quick turnaround time. Finally, since most of these models are deployed on-site, it is important to have resource constrained models which do not require GPUs. We demonstrate how we custom train resource constrained models and deploy them on embedded devices without significant loss in accuracy. To our knowledge, this is the first work which provides a comprehensive evaluation of different deep learning models on various real-world customer deployment scenarios of surveillance video analytics. By sharing our implementation details and the experiences learned from deploying customized deep learning models for various customers, we hope that customized deep learning based video analytics is widely incorporated in commercial products around the world.

本白皮书展示了我们定制的基于深度学习的视频分析系统在专注于安全性，安全性，客户分析和流程合规性的各种应用中的有效性。我们描述了我们的视频分析系统，包括搜索，总结，统计和实时警报，并概述其构建模块。这些构建块包括对象检测，跟踪，人脸检测和识别，人脸和人脸子属性分析。在每种情况下，我们都演示了如何使用部署场景中的数据进行训练的定制模型比现成的模型具有更高的精度。为此，我们描述了我们的数据处理和模型训练管道，可以快速周转时间从视频中训练和微调模型。最后，由于大多数这些模型都是现场部署的，因此拥有不需要GPU的资源受限模型非常重要。我们演示了我们如何定制培训资源约束模型并将它们部署在嵌入式设备上，而不会显着降低准确性。据我们所知，这是第一项工作，它提供了对监控视频分析的各种实际客户部署场景的不同深度学习模型的全面评估。通过分享我们的实施细节和为各种客户部署定制深度学习模式所获得的经验，我们希望定制的基于深度学习的视频分析广泛应用于世界各地的商业产品中。
