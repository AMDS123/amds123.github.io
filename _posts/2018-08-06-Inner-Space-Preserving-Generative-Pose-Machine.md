##### Abstract
Image-based generative methods, such as generative adversarial networks (GANs) have already been able to generate realistic images with much context control, specially when they are conditioned. However, most successful frameworks share a common procedure which performs an image-to-image translation with pose of figures in the image untouched. When the objective is reposing a figure in an image while preserving the rest of the image, the state-of-the-art mainly assumes a single rigid body with simple background and limited pose shift, which can hardly be extended to the images under normal settings. In this paper, we introduce an image "inner space" preserving model that assigns an interpretable low-dimensional pose descriptor (LDPD) to an articulated figure in the image. Figure reposing is then generated by passing the LDPD and the original image through multi-stage augmented hourglass networks in a conditional GAN structure, called inner space preserving generative pose machine (ISP-GPM). We evaluated ISP-GPM on reposing human figures, which are highly articulated with versatile variations. Test of a state-of-the-art pose estimator on our reposed dataset gave an accuracy over 80% on PCK0.5 metric. The results also elucidated that our ISP-GPM is able to preserve the background with high accuracy while reasonably recovering the area blocked by the figure to be reposed.

基于图像的生成方法，例如生成对抗网络（GAN）已经能够生成具有大量上下文控制的真实图像，特别是当它们被调节时。然而，大多数成功的框架共享一个共同的过程，该过程执行图像到图像的转换，图像中的图形姿势不受影响。当目标是在保留图像的其余部分的同时在图像中放置图形时，现有技术主要假设具有简单背景和有限姿势偏移的单个刚体，其在正常情况下几乎不能扩展到图像。设置。在本文中，我们介绍了一个图像“内部空间”保留模型，该模型将可解释的低维姿态描述符（LDPD）分配给图像中的关节图。然后通过将LDPD和原始图像通过条件GAN结构中的多级增强沙漏网络传递来生成图形重新定位，该结构称为内部空间保留生成姿势机器（ISP-GPM）。我们评估了ISP-GPM对人体形象的重新定位，这些人物形象具有多种多样的变化。在我们的驻留数据集上测试最先进的姿势估计器，使得PCK0.5度量的准确度超过80％。结果还说明我们的ISP-GPM能够高精度地保留背景，同时合理地恢复被待处理的图形阻挡的区域。
