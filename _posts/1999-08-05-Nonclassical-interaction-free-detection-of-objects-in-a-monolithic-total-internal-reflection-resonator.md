##### Abstract
We show that with an efficiency exceeding 99% one can use a monolithic total-internal-reflection resonator in order to ascertain the presence of an object without transferring a quantum of energy to it. We also propose an experiment on the probabilistic meaning of the electric field that contains only a very few photons.
