##### Abstract
Analysis of retinal fundus images is essential for eye-care physicians in the diagnosis, care and treatment of patients. Accurate fundus and/or retinal vessel maps give rise to longitudinal studies able to utilize multimedia image registration and disease/condition status measurements, as well as applications in surgery preparation and biometrics. The segmentation of retinal morphology has numerous applications in assessing ophthalmologic and cardiovascular disease pathologies. The early detection of many such conditions is often the most effective method for reducing patient risk. Computer aided segmentation of the vasculature has proven to be a challenge, mainly due to inconsistencies such as noise and variations in hue and brightness that can greatly reduce the quality of fundus images. This paper presents PixelBNN, a highly efficient deep method for automating the segmentation of fundus morphologies. The model was trained, tested and cross tested on the DRIVE, STARE and CHASE\_DB1 retinal vessel segmentation datasets. Performance was evaluated using G-mean, Mathews Correlation Coefficient and F1-score. The network was 8.5 times faster than the current state-of-the-art at test time and performed comparatively well, considering a 5 to 19 times reduction in information from resizing images during preprocessing.

分析眼底图像对眼睛保健医师在诊断，护理和治疗患者中至关重要。准确的眼底和/或视网膜血管图可以产生纵向研究，能够利用多媒体图像配准和疾病/病情状态测量，以及在手术准备和生物测量中的应用。视网膜形态的分割在评估眼科和心血管疾病病理学方面有许多应用。早期发现许多这样的情况往往是降低患者风险的最有效的方法。事实证明，脉管系统的计算机辅助分割是一个挑战，主要是由于噪声和色调和亮度的变化等不一致性，可能会大大降低眼底图像的质量。本文介绍了PixelBNN，一种高效的深度自动分割眼底形态的方法。该模型在DRIVE，STARE和CHASE \ _DB1视网膜血管分割数据集上进行了训练，测试和交叉测试。表现评估使用G均值，Mathews相关系数和F1分数。考虑到在预处理过程中调整图像大小，信息量减少了5到19倍，网络的测试速度比当前技术水平快8.5倍，表现相对较好。
