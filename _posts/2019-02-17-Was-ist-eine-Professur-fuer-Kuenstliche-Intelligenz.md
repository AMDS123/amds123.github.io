##### Abstract
The Federal Government of Germany aims to boost the research in the field of Artificial Intelligence (AI). For instance, 100 new professorships are said to be established. However, the white paper of the government does not answer what an AI professorship is at all. In order to give colleagues, politicians, and citizens an idea, we present a view that is often followed when appointing professors for AI at German and international universities. We hope that it will help to establish a guideline with internationally accepted measures and thus make the public debate more informed.
