##### Abstract
The ability to generate appropriate verbal and non-verbal backchannels by an agent during human-robot interaction greatly enhances the interaction experience. Backchannels are particularly important in applications like tutoring and counseling, which require constant attention and engagement of the user. We present here a method for training a robot for backchannel generation during a human-robot interaction within the reinforcement learning (RL) framework, with the goal of maintaining high engagement level. Since online learning by interaction with a human is highly time-consuming and impractical, we take advantage of the recorded human-to-human dataset and approach our problem as a batch reinforcement learning problem. The dataset is utilized as a batch data acquired by some behavior policy. We perform experiments with laughs as a backchannel and train an agent with value-based techniques. In particular, we demonstrate the effectiveness of recurrent layers in the approximate value function for this problem, that boosts the performance in partially observable environments. With off-policy policy evaluation, it is shown that the RL agents are expected to produce more engagement than an agent trained from imitation learning.
