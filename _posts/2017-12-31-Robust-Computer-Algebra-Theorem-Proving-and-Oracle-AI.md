##### Abstract
In the context of superintelligent AI systems, the term "oracle" has two meanings. One refers to modular systems queried for domain-specific tasks. Another usage, referring to a class of systems which may be useful for addressing the value alignment and AI control problems, is a superintelligent AI system that only answers questions. The aim of this manuscript is to survey contemporary research problems related to oracles which align with long-term research goals of AI safety. We examine existing question answering systems and argue that their high degree of architectural heterogeneity makes them poor candidates for rigorous analysis as oracles. On the other hand, we identify computer algebra systems (CASs) as being primitive examples of domain-specific oracles for mathematics and argue that efforts to integrate computer algebra systems with theorem provers, systems which have largely been developed independent of one another, provide a concrete set of problems related to the notion of provable safety that has emerged in the AI safety community. We review approaches to interfacing CASs with theorem provers, describe well-defined architectural deficiencies that have been identified with CASs, and suggest possible lines of research and practical software projects for scientists interested in AI safety.

在超智能的AI系统中，“oracle”这个词有两个含义。一个是指针对领域特定任务查询的模块化系统。另一个用法指的是一类可能有助于解决价值对齐和AI控制问题的系统，它是一个只能回答问题的超智能AI系统。这篇论文的目的是调查与AI安全的长期研究目标相一致的与神谕相关的当代研究问题。我们考察现有的问题回答系统，并认为他们高度的建筑异质性使他们不适合进行严谨的分析。另一方面，我们将计算机代数系统（CASs）确定为数学领域特定的神谕的原始例子，并认为将计算机代数系统与定理证明者相结合的努力，主要是相互独立开发的系统， AI安全社区中出现的与可证明安全概念有关的具体问题。我们回顾了用定理证明书来连接CASs的方法，描述了已经与CASs确定的定义明确的架构缺陷，并且为对AI安全感兴趣的科学家们提供了可能的研究和实用软件项目。
