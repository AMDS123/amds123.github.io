##### Abstract
Image classification is the task of assigning to an input image a label from a fixed set of categories. One of its most important applicative fields is that of robotics, in particular the needing of a robot to be aware of what's around and the consequent exploitation of that information as a benefit for its tasks. In this work we consider the problem of a robot that enters a new environment and wants to understand visual data coming from its camera, so to extract knowledge from them. As main novelty we want to overcome the needing of a physical robot, as it could be expensive and unhandy, so to hopefully enhance, speed up and ease the research in this field. That's why we propose to develop an application for a mobile platform that wraps several deep visual recognition tasks. First we deal with a simple Image classification, testing a model obtained from an AlexNet trained on the ILSVRC 2012 dataset. Several photo settings are considered to better understand which factors affect most the quality of classification. For the same purpose we are interested to integrate the classification task with an extra module dealing with segmentation of the object inside the image. In particular we propose a technique for extracting the object shape and moving out all the background, so to focus the classification only on the region occupied by the object. Another significant task that is included is that of object discovery. Its purpose is to simulate the situation in which the robot needs a certain object to complete one of its activities. It starts searching for what it needs by looking around and trying to understand the location of the object by scanning the surrounding environment. Finally we provide a tool for dealing with the creation of customized task-specific databases, meant to better suit to one's needing in a particular vision task.

图像分类是为输入图像分配一组固定类别的标签的任务。其最重要的应用领域之一是机器人技术领域，尤其是机器人需要了解周围的情况以及随之而来的利用该信息作为其任务的益处。在这项工作中，我们考虑一个机器人进入一个新环境的问题，并希望了解来自其相机的视觉数据，从而从中提取知识。作为主要的新奇事物，我们想要克服物理机器人的需求，因为它可能是昂贵的，不方便的，所以希望能够加强，加速和简化在这个领域的研究。这就是为什么我们建议开发一个移动平台的应用程序，包装几个深刻的视觉识别任务。首先我们处理一个简单的图像分类，测试从ILSVRC 2012数据集上训练的AlexNet获得的模型。多个照片设置被认为可以更好地理解哪些因素影响分类质量。出于同样的目的，我们有兴趣将分类任务与处理图像内部对象分割的额外模块相结合。具体而言，我们提出了一种提取物体形状并移出所有背景的技术，以便将分类集中在物体所占据的区域上。另一个重要的任务就是对象发现。其目的是模拟机器人需要某个物体完成其活动之一的情况。它开始通过环顾四周寻找所需的东西，并通过扫描周围的环境来了解对象的位置。最后，我们提供了一个工具，用于处理创建定制的特定任务数据库，以便更好地适应特定视觉任务中的需要。
