##### Abstract
This paper proposes an original statistical decision theory to accomplish a multi-speaker recognition task in cocktail party problem. This theory relies on an assumption that the varied frequencies of speakers obey Gaussian distribution and the relationship of their voiceprints can be represented by Euclidean distance vectors. This paper uses Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients to extract the feature of a voice in judging whether a speaker is included in a multi-speaker environment and distinguish who the speaker should be. Finally, a thirteen-dimension constellation drawing is established by mapping from Manhattan distances of speakers in order to take a thorough consideration about gross influential factors.

本文提出了一个独创的统计决策理论来完成鸡尾酒会问题中的多说话人识别任务。这个理论依赖于一个假设，说话人的不同频率服从高斯分布，他们的声音之间的关系可以用欧几里德距离向量表示。本文使用Mel频率倒谱系数来提取语音的特征，判断一个说话者是否被包含在多个说话者环境中，并区分说话者应该是谁。最后，通过曼哈顿距离映射来建立十三维星座图，以便对影响因素进行全面考虑。
