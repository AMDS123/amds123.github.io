##### Abstract
Multimodal biometric identification has been grown a great attention in the most interests in the security fields. In the real world there exist modern system devices that are able to detect, recognize, and classify the human identities with reliable and fast recognition rates. Unfortunately most of these systems rely on one modality, and the reliability for two or more modalities are further decreased. The variations of face images with respect to different poses are considered as one of the important challenges in face recognition systems. In this paper, we propose a multimodal biometric system that able to detect the human face images that are not only one view face image, but also multi-view face images. Each subject entered to the system adjusted their face at front of the three cameras, and then the features of the face images are extracted based on Speeded Up Robust Features (SURF) algorithm. We utilize Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) and combined classifiers based on both Learning Vector Quantization (LVQ), and Radial Basis Function (RBF) for classification purposes. The proposed system has been tested using SDUMLA-HMT, and CASIA datasets. Furthermore, we collected a database of multi-view face images by which we take the additive white Gaussian noise into considerations. The results indicated the reliability, robustness of the proposed system with different poses and variations including noise images.

多模式生物特征识别已经成为安全领域最受关注的重点。在现实世界中，存在能够以可靠和快速的识别率检测，识别和分类人类身份的现代系统设备。不幸的是，这些系统中的大多数依赖于一种模式，并且两种或更多种模式的可靠性进一步降低。人脸图像相对于不同姿势的变化被认为是人脸识别系统中的一个重要挑战。在本文中，我们提出了一种多模态生物特征识别系统，能够检测人脸图像不仅是一个人脸图像，而且多视图人脸图像。输入到系统中的每个主体在三台摄像机前面调整他们的脸部，然后基于加速度稳健特征（SURF）算法提取脸部图像的特征。我们利用多层感知器（MLP）和基于学习矢量量化（LVQ）和径向基函数（RBF）的组合分类器进行分类。所提出的系统已经使用SDUMLA-HMT和CASIA数据集进行了测试。此外，我们收集了一个多视角人脸图像的数据库，由此我们考虑加性高斯白噪声。结果表明所提出的系统具有不同的姿态和变化，包括噪声图像的可靠性，鲁棒性。
