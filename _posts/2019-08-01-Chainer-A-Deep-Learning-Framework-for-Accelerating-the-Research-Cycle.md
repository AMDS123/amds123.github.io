##### Abstract
Software frameworks for neural networks play a key role in the development and application of deep learning methods. In this paper, we introduce the Chainer framework, which intends to provide a flexible, intuitive, and high performance means of implementing the full range of deep learning models needed by researchers and practitioners. Chainer provides acceleration using Graphics Processing Units with a familiar NumPy-like API through CuPy, supports general and dynamic models in Python through Define-by-Run, and also provides add-on packages for state-of-the-art computer vision models as well as distributed training.
