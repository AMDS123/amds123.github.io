##### Abstract
Thanks to the low operational cost and large storage capacity of smartphones and wearable devices, people are recording many hours of daily activities, sport actions and home videos. These videos, also known as egocentric videos, are generally long-running streams with unedited content, which make them boring and visually unpalatable, bringing up the challenge to make egocentric videos more appealing. In this work we propose a novel methodology to compose the new fast-forward video by selecting frames based on semantic information extracted from images. The experiments show that our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art as far as semantic information is concerned and that it is also able to produce videos that are more pleasant to be watched.

由于智能手机和可穿戴设备运营成本低，存储容量大，人们记录日常活动，体育活动和家庭视频的时间长达数小时。这些视频也被称为以自我为中心的视频，通常是长时间运行的内容流，未经编辑的内容使得它们变得无聊而且视觉上令人难以接受，从而挑战以自我为中心的视频更具吸引力。在这项工作中，我们提出了一种新颖的方法，通过选择基于从图像中提取的语义信息的帧来组成新的快进视频。实验显示，就语义信息而言，我们的方法胜过最先进的技术，并且还能够生成更令人愉快的视频。
