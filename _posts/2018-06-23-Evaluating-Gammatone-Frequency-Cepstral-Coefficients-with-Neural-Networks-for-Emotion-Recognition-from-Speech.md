##### Abstract
Current approaches to speech emotion recognition focus on speech features that can capture the emotional content of a speech signal. Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs) are one of the most commonly used representations for audio speech recognition and classification. This paper proposes Gammatone Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (GFCCs) as a potentially better representation of speech signals for emotion recognition. The effectiveness of MFCC and GFCC representations are compared and evaluated over emotion and intensity classification tasks with fully connected and recurrent neural network architectures. The results provide evidence that GFCCs outperform MFCCs in speech emotion recognition.

语音情感识别的当前方法集中于可捕捉语音信号的情绪内容的语音特征。 Mel频率倒谱系数（MFCC）是用于音频语音识别和分类的最常用表示之一。本文提出Gammatone频率倒谱系数（GFCCs）作为情感识别语音信号的潜在更好的表示。 MFCC和GFCC表征的有效性在情感和强度分类任务中与完全连接的和递归的神经网络架构进行比较和评估。这些结果提供了证据表明GFCC在言语情绪识别中胜过MFCC。
