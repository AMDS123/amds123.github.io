##### Abstract
It is undeniable that artificial intelligence (AI) and blockchain concepts are spreading at a phenomenal rate. Both technologies have distinct degree of technological complexity and multi-dimensional business implications. However, a common misunderstanding about blockchain concept, in particular, is that blockchain is decentralized and is not controlled by anyone. But the underlying development of a blockchain system is still attributed to a cluster of core developers. Take smart contract as an example, it is essentially a collection of codes (or functions) and data (or states) that are programmed and deployed on a blockchain (say, Ethereum) by different human programmers. It is thus, unfortunately, less likely to be free of loopholes and flaws. In this article, through a brief overview about how artificial intelligence could be used to deliver bug-free smart contract so as to achieve the goal of blockchain 2.0, we to emphasize that the blockchain implementation can be assisted or enhanced via various AI techniques. The alliance of AI and blockchain is expected to create numerous possibilities.

不可否认的是，人工智能（AI）和区块链概念正在以惊人的速度蔓延。这两种技术都具有不同程度的技术复杂性和多维业务影响。然而，区块链概念的一个常见误解，特别是区块链是分散的，不受任何人的控制。但是区块链系统的底层开发仍然归功于一批核心开发人员。以智能合约为例，它本质上是由不同人类程序员在区块链（如Ethereum）上编程和部署的代码（或函数）和数据（或状态）的集合。不幸的是，它不太可能没有漏洞和缺陷。在本文中，通过简要概述如何使用人工智能来提供无缺陷的智能合约以实现区块链2.0的目标，我们强调区块链实现可以通过各种AI技术来辅助或增强。人工智能和区块链联盟预计会创造无数的可能性。
