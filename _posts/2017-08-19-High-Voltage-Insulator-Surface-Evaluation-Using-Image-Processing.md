##### Abstract
High voltage insulators are widely deployed in power systems to isolate the live- and dead-part of overhead lines as well as to support the power line conductors mechanically. Permanent, secure and safe operation of power transmission lines require that the high voltage insulators are inspected and monitor, regularly. Severe environment conditions will influence insulator surface and change creepage distance. Consequently, power utilities and transmission companies face significant problem in operation due to insulator damage or contamination. In this study, a new technique is developed for real-time inspection of insulator and estimating the snow, ice and water over the insulator surface which can be a potential risk of operation breakdown. To examine the proposed system, practical experiment is conducted using ceramic insulator for capturing the images with snow, ice and wet surface conditions. Gabor and Standard deviation filters are utilized for image feature extraction. The best achieved recognition accuracy rate was 87% using statistical approach the Standard deviation.

高压绝缘子广泛应用于电力系统中，以隔离架空线路的火线和死线，同时机械支撑电力线路导线。输电线路的永久性，安全和安全运行要求定期检查和监视高压绝缘子。恶劣的环境条件将影响绝缘体表面和改变爬电距离。因此，由于绝缘子的损坏或污染，电力公司和输电公司面临严重的运行问题。在这项研究中，开发了一种新技术，用于实时检测绝缘子，并估算绝缘子表面上的积雪，冰和水，这可能是潜在的运行故障风险。为了检验所提出的系统，使用陶瓷绝缘体进行实际实验以捕获具有雪，冰和潮湿表面条件的图像。 Gabor和标准偏差滤波器被用于图像特征提取。使用统计方法的标准偏差，最佳实现的识别准确率为87％。
