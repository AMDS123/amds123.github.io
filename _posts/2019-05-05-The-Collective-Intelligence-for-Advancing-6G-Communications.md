##### Abstract
The fifth-generation cellular networks (5G) has boosted the unprecedented convergence between the information world and physical world. On the other hand, empowered with the enormous amount of data and information, artificial intelligence (AI) has been universally applied and pervasive AI is believed to be an integral part of the future cellular networks (e.g., beyond 5G, B5G or the possible sixth-generation cellular networks, 6G). Consequently, benefiting from the advancement in communication technology and AI, we boldly argue that the conditions for collective intelligence (CI) will be mature in the B5G/6G era and CI will emerge among the widely connected beings and things. Afterwards, we introduce a regular language (i.e., the information economy metalanguage) supporting the future communications among agents and augment human intelligence. Meanwhile, we demonstrate the achievement of agents in a simulated scenario where the agents collectively work together to form a pattern through simple indirect communications. Finally, we discuss an anytime universal intelligence test model to evaluate the intelligence level of collective agents.
