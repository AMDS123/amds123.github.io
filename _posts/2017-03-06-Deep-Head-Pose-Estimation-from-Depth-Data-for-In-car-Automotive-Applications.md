##### Abstract
Recently, deep learning approaches have achieved promising results in various fields of computer vision. In this paper, we tackle the problem of head pose estimation through a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). Differently from other proposals in the literature, the described system is able to work directly and based only on raw depth data. Moreover, the head pose estimation is solved as a regression problem and does not rely on visual facial features like facial landmarks. We tested our system on a well known public dataset, Biwi Kinect Head Pose, showing that our approach achieves state-of-art results and is able to meet real time performance requirements.

近年来，深度学习方法在计算机视觉的各个领域取得了可喜的成果。在本文中，我们通过卷积神经网络（CNN）来解决头部姿态估计的问题。与文献中的其他建议不同，所描述的系统能够直接工作并仅基于原始深度数据。此外，头部姿态估计被解决为回归问题，并且不依赖于面部标志等视觉面部特征。我们在众所周知的公共数据集Biwi Kinect Head Pose上测试了我们的系统，表明我们的方法达到了最新的结果，并能够满足实时性能要求。
