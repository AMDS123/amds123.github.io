##### Abstract
Signal-based Surveillance systems such as Closed Circuits Televisions (CCTV) have been widely installed in public places. Those systems are normally used to find the events with security interest, and play a significant role in public safety. Though such systems are still heavily reliant on human labour to monitor the captured information, there have been a number of automatic techniques proposed to analysing the data. This article provides an overview of automatic surveillance event detection techniques . Despite it's popularity in research, it is still too challenging a problem to be realised in a real world deployment. The challenges come from not only the detection techniques such as signal processing and machine learning, but also the experimental design with factors such as data collection, evaluation protocols, and ground-truth annotation. Finally, this article propose that multi-disciplinary research is the path towards a solution to this problem.

闭路电视（CCTV）等基于信号的监视系统已广泛安装在公共场所。这些系统通常用于发现具有安全利益的事件，并在公共安全方面发挥重要作用。虽然这样的系统仍然严重依赖人力来监视所捕获的信息，但是已经提出了许多用于分析数据的自动技术。本文提供了自动监视事件检测技术的概述。尽管它在研究领域很受欢迎，但是在现实世界的部署中仍然是一个难题。挑战不仅来自信号处理和机器学习等检测技术，而且还包括数据收集，评估协议和地面实况标注等因素的实验设计。最后，本文提出多学科研究是解决这个问题的途径。
