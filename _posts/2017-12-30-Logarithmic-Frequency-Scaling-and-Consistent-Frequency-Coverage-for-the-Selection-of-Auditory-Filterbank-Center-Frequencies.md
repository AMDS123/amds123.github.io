##### Abstract
This paper provides new insights into the problem of selecting filter center frequencies for the auditory filterbanks. We propose to use a constant frequency distance and a consistent frequency coverage as the two metrics that motivate the logarithmic frequency scaling and a regularized selection of center frequencies. The frequency scaling and the consistent frequency coverage have been derived based on a common harmonic speaker signal model. Furthermore, we have found that the existing linear equivalent rectangular bandwidth (ERB) function as well as any possible linear ERB approximation can also lead to a consistent frequency coverage. The results are verified and demonstrated using the gammatone filterbank.

本文为听觉滤波器组选择滤波器中心频率问题提供了新的见解。我们建议使用恒定的频率距离和一致的频率覆盖作为激励对数频率缩放和正则化中心频率选择的两个度量。已经基于普通的谐波扬声器信号模型推导出频率缩放和一致的频率覆盖。此外，我们发现现有的线性等效矩形带宽（ERB）函数以及任何可能的线性ERB近似也可以导致一致的频率覆盖。使用gammatone滤波器组验证和证明结果。
