##### Abstract
A major problem in data augmentation is the number of possibilities in the search space of operations. The search space includes mixtures of all of the possible data augmentation techniques, the magnitude of these operations, and the probability of applying data augmentation for each image. In this paper, we propose Greedy AutoAugment as a highly efficient searching algorithm to find the best augmentation policies. We combine the searching process with a simple procedure to increase the size of training data. Our experiments show that the proposed method can be used as a reliable addition to the ANN infrastructures for increasing the accuracy of classification results.
