##### Abstract
The paper attempts to validate the effectiveness of tree classifiers to classify tabla strokes especially the ones which are overlapping in nature. It uses decision tree, ID3 and random forest as classifiers. A custom made data sets of 650 samples of 13 different tabla strokes were used for experimental purpose. 31 different features with their mean and variances were extracted for classification. Three data sets consisting of 21361, 18802 and 19543 instances respectively were used for the purpose. Validation has been done using measures like ROC curve and accuracy. The experimental results showed that all the classifiers showing excellent results with random forest outperforming the other two. The effectiveness of random forest in classifying strokes which are overlapping in nature is done by comparing the known results of that with multi-layer perceptron.

本文试图验证树分类器对特征分类的有效性，特别是对性质重叠的特征分类。它使用决策树，ID3和随机森林作为分类器。一个由13个不同tabla笔画组成的650个样本的定制数据集被用于实验目的。提取了31个不同的均值和方差特征进行分类。三个数据集分别由21361,18802和19543个实例组成。已经使用诸如ROC曲线和准确度之类的措施进行验证。实验结果表明，随机森林分类结果优于其他两种分类方法。随机森林在自然界重叠划分中的有效性是通过将已知的结果与多层感知器进行比较来完成的。
