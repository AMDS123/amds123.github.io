##### Abstract
Robotic grasp detection task is still challenging, particularly for novel objects. With the recent advance of deep learning, there have been several works on detecting robotic grasp using neural networks. Typically, regression based grasp detection methods have outperformed classification based detection methods in computation complexity with excellent accuracy. However, classification based robotic grasp detection still seems to have merits such as intermediate step observability and straightforward back propagation routine for end-to-end training. In this work, we propose a novel classification based robotic grasp detection method with multiple-stage spatial transformer networks (STN). Our proposed method was able to achieve state-of-the-art performance in accuracy with real- time computation. Additionally, unlike other regression based grasp detection methods, our proposed method allows partial observation for intermediate results such as grasp location and orientation for a number of grasp configuration candidates.

机器人抓握检测任务仍然具有挑战性，特别是对于新颖的物体。随着近期深度学习的深入，已经有几篇关于使用神经网络检测机器人抓握的作品。典型地，基于回归的抓握检测方法在计算复杂度方面优于基于分类的检测方法，并且具有极好的准确性然而，基于分类的机器人抓握检测仍似乎具有诸如中间步骤可观察性和端对端训练的直接反向传播例程的优点。在这项工作中，我们提出了一种基于多级空间变换网络（STN）的基于分类的机器人抓握检测方法。我们提出的方法能够通过实时计算实现最高的精度性能。此外，与其他基于回归的抓握检测方法不同，我们提出的方法允许对诸如抓握位置和方向等中间结果进行局部观察以获得多个抓握配置候选。
