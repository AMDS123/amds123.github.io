##### Abstract
With the rapid growth of social media on the web, emotional polarity computation has become a flourishing frontier in the text mining community. However, it is challenging to understand the latest trends and summarize the state or general opinions about products due to the big diversity and size of social media data and this creates the need of automated and real time opinion extraction and mining. On the other hand, the bulk of current research has been devoted to study the subjective sentences which contain opinion keywords and limited work has been reported for objective statements that imply sentiment. In this paper, fuzzy based knowledge engineering model has been developed for sentiment classification of special group of such sentences including the change or deviation from desired range or value. Drug reviews are the rich source of such statements. Therefore, in this research, some experiments were carried out on patient's reviews on several different cholesterol lowering drugs to determine their sentiment polarity. The main conclusion through this study is, in order to increase the accuracy level of existing drug opinion mining systems, objective sentences which imply opinion should be taken into account. Our experimental results demonstrate that our proposed model obtains over 72 percent F1 value.

随着社交媒体在网络上的快速增长，情感极性计算已经成为文本挖掘社区的蓬勃发展前沿。然而，由于社交媒体数据的多样性和规模的巨大，了解最新趋势并总结产品的状态或一般性意见是一个挑战，这就需要自动和实时的意见提取和挖掘。另一方面，目前大部分的研究都致力于研究含有意见关键词的主观句子，而对于意味着情感的客观语句却报道了有限的工作。本文提出了基于模糊理论的知识工程模型，用于特定群体的情感分类，包括期望范围或价值的变化或偏离。药物评论是这些陈述的丰富来源。因此，在本研究中，对几种不同降胆固醇药物的患者评价进行了一些实验，以确定其情绪极性。通过本研究得出的主要结论是，为了提高现有药物意见挖掘系统的准确性水平，应考虑意见含意的客观句子。我们的实验结果表明，我们提出的模型获得超过72％的F1值。
