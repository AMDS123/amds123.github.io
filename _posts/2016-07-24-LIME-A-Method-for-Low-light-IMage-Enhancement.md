##### Abstract
When one captures images in low-light conditions, the images often suffer from low visibility. This poor quality may significantly degrade the performance of many computer vision and multimedia algorithms that are primarily designed for high-quality inputs. In this paper, we propose a very simple and effective method, named as LIME, to enhance low-light images. More concretely, the illumination of each pixel is first estimated individually by finding the maximum value in R, G and B channels. Further, we refine the initial illumination map by imposing a structure prior on it, as the final illumination map. Having the well-constructed illumination map, the enhancement can be achieved accordingly. Experiments on a number of challenging real-world low-light images are present to reveal the efficacy of our LIME and show its superiority over several state-of-the-arts.

当在低光照条件下拍摄图像时，图像的可见度往往较低。质量较差可能会显着降低许多主要为高质量输入设计的计算机视觉和多媒体算法的性能。在本文中，我们提出了一个非常简单而有效的方法，命名为LIME，以增强低光图像。更具体地说，首先通过在R，G和B通道中找到最大值来分别估计每个像素的照度。此外，我们通过在其之前施加结构来优化初始照明图，作为最终照明图。具有良好构造的照明图，可以相应地实现增强。为了揭示我们的LIME的功效，并展示了它在几个艺术领域的优越性，我们展示了许多具有挑战性的真实世界的低光图像的实验。
