##### Abstract
This survey presents the main results achieved for the influence maximization problem in social networks. This problem is well studied in the literature and, thanks to its recent applications, some of which currently deployed on the field, it is receiving more and more attention in the scientific community. The problem can be formulated as follows: given a graph, with each node having a certain probability of influencing its neighbors, select a subset of vertices so that the number of nodes in the network that are influenced is maximized. Starting from this model, we introduce the main theoretical developments and computational results that have been achieved, taking into account different diffusion models describing how the information spreads throughout the network, various ways in which the sources of information could be placed, and how to tackle the problem in the presence of uncertainties affecting the network. Finally, we present one of the main application that has been developed and deployed exploiting tools and techniques previously discussed.

本调查提出了社交网络中影响最大化问题的主要成果。在文献中对这个问题进行了很好的研究，并且由于其最近的应用，其中一些目前已经部署在该领域，它在科学界受到越来越多的关注。该问题可以表述如下：给定一个图，每个节点都有一定的概率影响它的邻居，选择一个顶点的子集，以便网络中受影响的节点数量最大化。从这个模型开始，我们介绍已经实现的主要理论发展和计算结果，并考虑了描述信息如何在整个网络中传播的不同扩散模型，可以放置信息源的各种方式，以及如何解决存在影响网络的不确定性时的问题。最后，我们介绍一个已经开发并部署了前面讨论的开发工具和技术的主要应用程序。
