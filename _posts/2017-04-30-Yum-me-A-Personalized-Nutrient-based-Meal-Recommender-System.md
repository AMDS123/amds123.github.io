##### Abstract
Nutrient-based meal recommendations have the potential to help individuals prevent or manage conditions such as diabetes and obesity. However, learning people's food preferences and making recommendations that simultaneously appeal to their palate and satisfy nutritional expectations are challenging. Existing approaches either only learn high-level preferences or require a prolonged learning period. We propose Yum-me, a personalized nutrient-based meal recommender system designed to meet individuals' nutritional expectations, dietary restrictions, and fine-grained food preferences. Yum-me enables a simple and accurate food preference profiling procedure via a visual quiz-based user interface, and projects the learned profile into the domain of nutritionally appropriate food options to find ones that will appeal to the user. We present the design and implementation of Yum-me, and further describe and evaluate two innovative contributions. The first contriution is an open source state-of-the-art food image analysis model, named FoodDist. We demonstrate FoodDist's superior performance through careful benchmarking and discuss its applicability across a wide array of dietary applications. The second contribution is a novel online learning framework that learns food preference from item-wise and pairwise image comparisons. We evaluate the framework in a field study of 227 anonymous users and demonstrate that it outperforms other baselines by a significant margin. We further conducted an end-to-end validation of the feasibility and effectiveness of Yum-me through a 60-person user study, in which Yum-me improves the recommendation acceptance rate by 42.63%.

基于营养素的膳食建议有可能帮助个人预防或管理诸如糖尿病和肥胖等疾病。然而，学习人们的食物偏好和提出建议，同时吸引他们的口味和满足营养期望是具有挑战性的。现有的方法要么只学习高层次的偏好，要么需要长时间的学习。我们建议Yum-me是一种个性化营养餐推荐系统，旨在满足个人的营养期望，饮食限制和细粒度的食物偏好。 Yum-me通过基于视觉测验的用户界面来实现简单而准确的食物偏好分析程序，并且将所学习的简档投影到适合营养的食物选项的范围中以找到对用户有吸引力的食物选项。我们介绍Yum-me的设计和实现，并进一步描述和评估两个创新贡献。第一个理由是一个开源的最先进的食物图像分析模型，名为FoodDist。我们通过仔细的基准测试证明了FoodDist的卓越性能，并讨论了它在各种饮食应用中的适用性。第二个贡献是一个新颖的在线学习框架，从项目和成对的图像比较中学习食物偏好。我们在对227名匿名用户的实地研究中评估框架，并证明它的表现优于其他基线。通过60人的用户研究，我们进一步验证了Yum-me的可行性和有效性，其中Yum-me将推荐接受率提高了42.63％。
