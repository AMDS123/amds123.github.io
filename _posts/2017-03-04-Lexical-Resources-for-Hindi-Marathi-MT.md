##### Abstract
In this paper we describe some ways to utilize various lexical resources to improve the quality of statistical machine translation system. We have augmented the training corpus with various lexical resources such as IndoWordnet semantic relation set, function words, kridanta pairs and verb phrases etc. Our research on the usage of lexical resources mainly focused on two ways such as augmenting parallel corpus with more vocabulary and augmenting with various word forms. We have described case studies, evaluations and detailed error analysis for both Marathi to Hindi and Hindi to Marathi machine translation systems. From the evaluations we observed that, there is an incremental growth in the quality of machine translation as the usage of various lexical resources increases. Moreover usage of various lexical resources helps to improve the coverage and quality of machine translation where limited parallel corpus is available.

本文介绍了利用各种词汇资源来提高统计机器翻译系统质量的一些方法。我们利用IndoWordnet语义关系集，函数词，kridanta对和动词短语等各种词汇资源扩充了训练语料库。对词汇资源使用的研究主要集中在两个方面，即增加词汇和增加平行语料库与各种单词形式。我们描述了马拉地语印地语和印地语马拉地语机器翻译系统的案例研究，评估和详细的错误分析。从评估中我们发现，随着各种词汇资源的使用量的增加，机器翻译的质量有了增长。此外，使用各种词汇资源有助于提高有限平行语料库的机器翻译的覆盖率和质量。
