##### Abstract
Hidden Markov Model (HMM) is often regarded as the dynamical model of choice in many fields and applications. It is also at the heart of most state-of-the-art speech recognition systems since the 70's. However, from Gaussian mixture models HMMs (GMM-HMM) to deep neural network HMMs (DNN-HMM), the underlying Markovian chain of state-of-the-art models did not changed much. The "left-to-right" topology is mostly always employed because very few other alternatives exist. In this paper, we propose that finely-tuned HMM topologies are essential for precise temporal modelling and that this approach should be investigated in state-of-the-art HMM system. As such, we propose a proof-of-concept framework for learning efficient topologies by pruning down complex generic models. Speech recognition experiments that were conducted indicate that complex time dependencies can be better learned by this approach than with classical "left-to-right" models.

隐马尔可夫模型（HMM）常被认为是许多领域和应用的动力学模型。自70年代以来，它也是大多数最先进的语音识别系统的核心。然而，从高斯混合模型HMM（GMM-HMM）到深度神经网络HMM（DNN-HMM），最先进模型的潜在马尔可夫链并没有太大改变。大多数情况下总是采用“从左到右”的拓扑结构，因为其他替代方案很少。在本文中，我们提出精细调整的HMM拓扑对于精确的时间建模是必不可少的，并且这种方法应当在最先进的HMM系统中进行研究。因此，我们提出了一个通过修剪复杂的泛型模型来学习高效拓扑的概念验证框架。语音识别实验表明，与传统的“从左到右”模型相比，这种方法可以更好地学习复杂的时间依赖关系。
