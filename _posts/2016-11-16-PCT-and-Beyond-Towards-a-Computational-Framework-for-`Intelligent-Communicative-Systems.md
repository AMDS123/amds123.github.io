##### Abstract
Recent years have witnessed increasing interest in the potential benefits of `intelligent' autonomous machines such as robots. Honda's Asimo humanoid robot, iRobot's Roomba robot vacuum cleaner and Google's driverless cars have fired the imagination of the general public, and social media buzz with speculation about a utopian world of helpful robot assistants or the coming robot apocalypse! However, there is a long way to go before autonomous systems reach the level of capabilities required for even the simplest of tasks involving human-robot interaction - especially if it involves communicative behaviour such as speech and language. Of course the field of Artificial Intelligence (AI) has made great strides in these areas, and has moved on from abstract high-level rule-based paradigms to embodied architectures whose operations are grounded in real physical environments. What is still missing, however, is an overarching theory of intelligent communicative behaviour that informs system-level design decisions in order to provide a more coherent approach to system integration. This chapter introduces the beginnings of such a framework inspired by the principles of Perceptual Control Theory (PCT). In particular, it is observed that PCT has hitherto tended to view perceptual processes as a relatively straightforward series of transformations from sensation to perception, and has overlooked the potential of powerful generative model-based solutions that have emerged in practical fields such as visual or auditory scene analysis. Starting from first principles, a sequence of arguments is presented which not only shows how these ideas might be integrated into PCT, but which also extend PCT towards a remarkably symmetric architecture for a needs-driven communicative agent. It is concluded that, if behaviour is the control of perception, then perception is the simulation of behaviour.

##### Abstract (translated by Google)
近年来，人们对“智能”自主机器如机器人的潜在益处越来越感兴趣。本田的Asimo人形机器人，iRobot的Roomba机器人吸尘器和Google的无人驾驶汽车已经激起了大众的想象力，而社交媒体也在猜测一个有益的机器人助手或即将到来的机器人启示的乌托邦世界！然而，即使涉及人机交互的最简单的任务，特别是如果涉及语言和语言等交际行为，自治系统也要达到所需的能力水平还有很长的路要走。当然，人工智能（AI）领域在这些领域已经取得了很大的进展，并且已经从抽象的高层次规则模式转变为体现架构，其操作基于真实的物理环境。然而，仍然缺少的是智能交际行为的总体理论，它告诉系统级的设计决策，以便为系统集成提供更一致的方法。本章从感性控制理论（PCT）的原则出发，介绍了这样一个框架的开始。具体而言，据观察，PCT迄今倾向于将感知过程视为从感觉到感知的一系列相对直接的转变，并忽略了在视觉或听觉等实际领域出现的强大的基于生成模型的解决方案的潜力现场分析。从第一原则出发，提出了一系列的论据，不仅显示了这些思想如何融入到PCT中，而且还将PCT扩展到了一个以需求为导向的交流动因的非常对称的体系结构。得出的结论是，如果行为是感知的控制，那么感知就是行为的模拟。
