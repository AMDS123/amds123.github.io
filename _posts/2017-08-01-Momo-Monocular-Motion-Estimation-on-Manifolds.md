##### Abstract
Knowledge about the location of a vehicle is indispensable for autonomous driving. In order to apply global localisation methods, a pose prior must be known which can be obtained from visual odometry. The quality and robustness of that prior determine the success of localisation. Momo is a monocular frame-to-frame motion estimation methodology providing a high quality visual odometry for that purpose. By taking into account the motion model of the vehicle, reliability and accuracy of the pose prior are significantly improved. We show that especially in low-structure environments Momo outperforms the state of the art. Moreover, the method is designed so that multiple cameras with or without overlap can be integrated. The evaluation on the KITTI-dataset and on a proper multi-camera dataset shows that even with only 100--300 feature matches the prior is estimated with high accuracy and in real-time.

关于车辆位置的知识对于自动驾驶是必不可少的。为了应用全局定位方法，必须知道可从视觉测距获得的姿势先验。之前的质量和稳健性决定了本地化的成功。 Momo是单眼帧到帧运动估计方法，为此提供了高质量的视觉测距。通过考虑车辆的运动模型，姿态先验的可靠性和准确性显着提高。我们表明，特别是在低结构环境中，Momo胜过了现有技术。而且，该方法被设计成使得可以集成具有或不具有重叠的多个照相机。对KITTI数据集和适当的多摄像机数据集进行的评估表明，即使只有100-300个特征匹配，先验估计的准确性和实时性也很高。
