##### Abstract
PIE is a Prolog-embedded environment for automated reasoning on the basis of first-order logic. It includes a versatile formula macro system and supports the creation of documents that intersperse macro definitions, reasoner invocations and LaTeX-formatted natural language text. Invocation of various reasoners is supported: External provers as well as sub-systems of PIE, which include preprocessors, a Prolog-based first-order prover, methods for Craig interpolation and methods for second-order quantifier elimination.
