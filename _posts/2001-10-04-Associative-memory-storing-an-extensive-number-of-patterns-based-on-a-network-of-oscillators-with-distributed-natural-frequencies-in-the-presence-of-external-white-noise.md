##### Abstract
We study associative memory based on temporal coding in which successful retrieval is realized as an entrainment in a network of simple phase oscillators with distributed natural frequencies under the influence of white noise. The memory patterns are assumed to be given by uniformly distributed random numbers on $[0,2\pi)$ so that the patterns encode the phase differences of the oscillators. To derive the macroscopic order parameter equations for the network with an extensive number of stored patterns, we introduce the effective transfer function by assuming the fixed-point equation of the form of the TAP equation, which describes the time-averaged output as a function of the effective time-averaged local field. Properties of the networks associated with synchronization phenomena for a discrete symmetric natural frequency distribution with three frequency components are studied based on the order parameter equations, and are shown to be in good agreement with the results of numerical simulations. Two types of retrieval states are found to occur with respect to the degree of synchronization, when the size of the width of the natural frequency distribution is changed.
