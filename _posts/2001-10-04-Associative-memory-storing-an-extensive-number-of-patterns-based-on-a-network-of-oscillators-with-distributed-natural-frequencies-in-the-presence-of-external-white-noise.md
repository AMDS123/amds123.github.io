##### Abstract
We study associative memory based on temporal coding in which successful retrieval is realized as an entrainment in a network of simple phase oscillators with distributed natural frequencies under the influence of white noise. The memory patterns are assumed to be given by uniformly distributed random numbers on $[0,2\pi)$ so that the patterns encode the phase differences of the oscillators. To derive the macroscopic order parameter equations for the network with an extensive number of stored patterns, we introduce the effective transfer function by assuming the fixed-point equation of the form of the TAP equation, which describes the time-averaged output as a function of the effective time-averaged local field. Properties of the networks associated with synchronization phenomena for a discrete symmetric natural frequency distribution with three frequency components are studied based on the order parameter equations, and are shown to be in good agreement with the results of numerical simulations. Two types of retrieval states are found to occur with respect to the degree of synchronization, when the size of the width of the natural frequency distribution is changed.

我们研究了基于时间编码的联想记忆，在白噪声的影响下，成功的检索被实现为简单相位振荡器网络中的分布固有频率的卷积。假定存储器模式由$ [0,2 \ pi）$上的均匀分布的随机数给出，以便模式编码振荡器的相位差。为了推导具有大量存储模式的网络的宏观有序参数方程，我们通过假设TAP方程形式的定点方程来引入有效传递函数，其描述了时间平均输出作为有效的时间平均的本地领域。基于有序参数方程研究了三个频率分量的离散对称固有频率分布的同步现象相关网络的性质，并与数值模拟结果吻合较好。当自然频率分布的宽度的大小改变时，发现关于同步程度发生两种类型的检索状态。
