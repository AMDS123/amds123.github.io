##### Abstract
This paper proposes a holistic multi-task Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) with the dynamic weights of the tasks,namely FaceLiveNet+, for face authentication. FaceLiveNet+ can employ face verification and facial expression recognition as a solution of liveness control simultaneously. Comparing to the single-task learning, the proposed multi-task learning can better capture the feature representation for all of the tasks. The experimental results show the superiority of the multi-task learning to the single-task learning for both the face verification task and facial expression recognition task. Rather using a conventional multi-task learning with fixed weights for the tasks, this work proposes a so called dynamic-weight-unit to automatically learn the weights of the tasks. The experiments have shown the effectiveness of the dynamic weights for training the networks. Finally, the holistic evaluation for face authentication based on the proposed protocol has shown the feasibility to apply the FaceLiveNet+ for face authentication.
