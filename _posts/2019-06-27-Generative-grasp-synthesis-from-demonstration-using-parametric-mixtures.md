##### Abstract
We present a parametric formulation for learning generative models for grasp synthesis from a demonstration. We cast new light on this family of approaches, proposing a parametric formulation for grasp synthesis that is computationally faster compared to related work and indicates better grasp success rate performance in simulated experiments, showing a gain of at least 10% success rate (p &lt; 0.05) in all the tested conditions. The proposed implementation is also able to incorporate arbitrary constraints for grasp ranking that may include task-specific constraints. Results are reported followed by a brief discussion on the merits of the proposed methods noted so far.
