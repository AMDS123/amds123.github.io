##### Abstract
Deep learning has been demonstrated its effectiveness and efficiency in music genre classification. However, the existing achievements still have several shortcomings which impair the performance of this classification task. In this paper, we propose a hybrid architecture which consists of the paralleling CNN and Bi-RNN blocks. They focus on spatial features and temporal frame orders extraction respectively. Then the two outputs are fused into one powerful representation of musical signals and fed into softmax function for classification. The paralleling network guarantees the extracting features robust enough to represent music. Moreover, the experiments prove our proposed architecture improve the music genre classification performance and the additional Bi-RNN block is a supplement for CNNs.

深度学习已经在音乐类型分类中被证明了其有效性和效率。但是，现有的成果还存在一些不利于本分类任务的缺陷。在本文中，我们提出了一个由并行CNN和Bi-RNN块组成的混合架构。他们分别关注空间特征和时间帧订单提取。然后将这两个输出融合成一个强大的音乐信号表示，并输入softmax函数进行分类。并联网络保证提取功能足够强壮来表示音乐。此外，实验证明我们提出的体系结构可以提高音乐体裁的分类性能，而附加的Bi-RNN块是CNN的补充。
