##### Abstract
In recent years, deep learning methods have been successfully applied to single-image super-resolution tasks. Despite their great performances, deep learning methods cannot be easily applied to real-world applications due to the requirement of heavy computation. In this paper, we address this issue by proposing an accurate and lightweight deep learning model for image super-resolution. In detail, we design an architecture that implements a cascading mechanism upon a residual network. We also present a variant model of the proposed cascading residual network to further improve efficiency. Our extensive experiments show that even with much fewer parameters and operations, our models achieve performance comparable to that of state-of-the-art methods.

近年来，深度学习方法已成功应用于单幅图像超分辨率任务。尽管它们表现出色，但由于需要大量计算，深度学习方法无法轻易应用于实际应用。在本文中，我们通过提出一个准确和轻量级的图像超分辨率深度学习模型来解决这个问题。详细来说，我们设计了一个在残余网络上实现级联机制的架构。我们还提出了提出的级联残余网络的变体模型，以进一步提高效率。我们广泛的实验表明，即使参数和操作少得多，我们的模型也能达到与最先进方法相媲美的性能。
