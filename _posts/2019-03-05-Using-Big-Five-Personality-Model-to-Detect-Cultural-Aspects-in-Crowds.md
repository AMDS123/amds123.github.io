##### Abstract
The use of information technology in the study of human behavior is a subject of great scientific interest. Cultural and personality aspects are factors that influence how people interact with one another in a crowd. This paper presents a methodology to detect cultural characteristics of crowds in video sequences. Based on filmed sequences, pedestrians are detected, tracked and characterized. Such information is then used to find out cultural differences in those videos, based on the Big-five personality model. Regarding cultural differences of each country, results indicate that this model generates coherent information when compared to data provided in literature.
