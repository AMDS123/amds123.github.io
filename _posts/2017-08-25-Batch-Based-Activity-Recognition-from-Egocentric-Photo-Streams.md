##### Abstract
Activity recognition from long unstructured egocentric photo-streams has several applications in assistive technology such as health monitoring and frailty detection, just to name a few. However, one of its main technical challenges is to deal with the low frame rate of wearable photo-cameras, which causes abrupt appearance changes between consecutive frames. In consequence, important discriminatory low-level features from motion such as optical flow cannot be estimated. In this paper, we present a batch-driven approach for training a deep learning architecture that strongly rely on Long short-term units to tackle this problem. We propose two different implementations of the same approach that process a photo-stream sequence using batches of fixed size with the goal of capturing the temporal evolution of high-level features. The main difference between these implementations is that one explicitly models consecutive batches by overlapping them. Experimental results over a public dataset acquired by three users demonstrate the validity of the proposed architectures to exploit the temporal evolution of convolutional features over time without relying on event boundaries.

来自长期非结构性自我中心照片流的活动识别在诸如健康监测和脆弱性检测等辅助技术中有几个应用，仅举几例。然而，其主要技术挑战之一是处理可穿戴摄像机的低帧速率，这导致连续帧之间的突然的外观变化。因此，不能估计来自诸如光流的运动的重要的歧视性低级特征。在本文中，我们提出了一种批量驱动的方法来训练深度学习架构，强烈依赖于Long的短期单元来解决这个问题。我们提出了相同方法的两种不同的实现方式，它们使用固定大小的批处理照片流序列，目的是捕获高级特征的时间演变。这些实现之间的主要区别是，通过重叠连续的批次来显式建模。三个用户获得的公共数据集的实验结果表明，所提出的体系结构的有效性是利用卷积特征随时间的时间演变而不依赖于事件边界。
