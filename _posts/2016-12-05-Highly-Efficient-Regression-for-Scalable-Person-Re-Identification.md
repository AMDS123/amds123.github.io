##### Abstract
Existing person re-identification models are poor for scaling up to large data required in real-world applications due to: (1) Complexity: They employ complex models for optimal performance resulting in high computational cost for training at a large scale; (2) Inadaptability: Once trained, they are unsuitable for incremental update to incorporate any new data available. This work proposes a truly scalable solution to re-id by addressing both problems. Specifically, a Highly Efficient Regression (HER) model is formulated by embedding the Fisher's criterion to a ridge regression model for very fast re-id model learning with scalable memory/storage usage. Importantly, this new HER model supports faster than real-time incremental model updates therefore making real-time active learning feasible in re-id with human-in-the-loop. Extensive experiments show that such a simple and fast model not only outperforms notably the state-of-the-art re-id methods, but also is more scalable to large data with additional benefits to active learning for reducing human labelling effort in re-id deployment.

由于以下原因，现有的人员重新识别模型在扩展到实际应用中所需的大数据方面很差：（1）复杂性：他们采用复杂模型来实现最佳性能，导致大规模培训的高计算成本; （2）不适应性：一旦接受培训，他们不适合进行增量更新以整合任何可用的新数据。这项工作提出了一个真正可扩展的解决方案来解决这两个问题。具体而言，通过将Fisher准则嵌入岭回归模型来制定高效回归（HER）模型，以用于具有可扩展记忆/存储使用的非常快速的重复模型学习。重要的是，这个新的HER模型支持更快的实时增量模型更新，因此可以在人在回路中实时地进行主动学习。大量的实验表明，这样一个简单而快速的模型不仅比现有技术的re-id方法更胜一筹，而且对于大数据更具可扩展性，还具有主动学习的额外益处，以减少重新标识部署。
