##### Abstract
Autonomous vehicles are currently being tested in a variety of scenarios. As we move towards autonomous vehicles, How do Intersections need to look? To answer that question, We break down an intersection management into the different conundrums and scenarios involved in the trajectory planning and current approaches to solve them. Then a brief analysis of current works in autonomous intersection is performed. With a critical eye, we try to delve into the current solutions' discrepancies while providing some critical and important factors that have been addressed and look at open issues that have to be addressed. We also try to answer the question of how to benchmark intersection management algorithms by providing some factors that have an impact on the system.

自主车辆目前正在各种场景中进行测试。当我们走向自动驾驶汽车时，交叉口如何看待？为了回答这个问题，我们将交叉管理划分为涉及轨迹规划和当前解决方案的不同难题和场景。然后对自动交集中的当前作品进行简要分析。以批判的眼光看，我们试图深入探讨当前解决方案的差异，同时提供已解决的一些关键和重要因素，并着眼于必须解决的开放问题。我们也试图回答如何通过提供一些对系统有影响的因素来对交叉管理算法进行基准测试的问题。
