##### Abstract
Spoken language translation (SLT) has become very important in an increasingly globalized world. Machine translation (MT) for automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems is a major challenge of great interest. This research investigates that automatic sentence segmentation of speech that is important for enriching speech recognition output and for aiding downstream language processing. This article focuses on the automatic sentence segmentation of speech and improving MT results. We explore the problem of identifying sentence boundaries in the transcriptions produced by automatic speech recognition systems in the Polish language. We also experiment with reverse normalization of the recognized speech samples.

在日益全球化的世界中，口语翻译（SLT）已经变得非常重要。用于自动语音识别（ASR）系统的机器翻译（MT）是非常令人感兴趣的主要挑战。本研究探讨了语音自动分词对丰富语音识别输出和辅助下游语言处理非常重要。本文重点讨论了语音的自动分词和改进MT结果。我们探讨了用波兰语自动语音识别系统产生的转录中识别句子边界的问题。我们也试验了识别语音样本的反向归一化。
