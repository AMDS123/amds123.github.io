##### Abstract
We propose a GAN design which models multiple distributions effectively and discovers their commonalities and particularities. Each data distribution is modeled with a mixture of $K$ generator distributions. As the generators are partially shared between the modeling of different true data distributions, shared ones captures the commonality of the distributions, while non-shared ones capture unique aspects of them. We show the effectiveness of our method on various datasets (MNIST, Fashion MNIST, CIFAR-10, Omniglot, CelebA) with compelling results.
