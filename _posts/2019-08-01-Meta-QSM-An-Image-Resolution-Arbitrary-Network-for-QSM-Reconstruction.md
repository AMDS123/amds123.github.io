##### Abstract
Quantitative Susceptibility Mapping (QSM) can estimate the underlying tissue magnetic susceptibility and reveal pathology. Current deep-learning-based approaches to solve the QSM inverse problem are restricted on fixed image resolution. They trained a specific model for each image resolution which is inefficient in computing. In this work, we proposed a novel method called Meta-QSM to firstly solve QSM reconstruction of arbitrary image resolution with a single model. In Meta-QSM, weight prediction was used to predict the weights of kernels by taking the image resolution as input. The proposed method was evaluated on synthetic data and clinical data with comparison to existing QSM reconstruction methods. The experimental results showed the Meta-QSM can effectively reconstruct susceptibility maps with different image resolution using one neural network training.
