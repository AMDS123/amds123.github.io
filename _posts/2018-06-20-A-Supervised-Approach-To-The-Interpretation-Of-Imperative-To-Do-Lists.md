##### Abstract
To-do lists are a popular medium for personal information management. As to-do tasks are increasingly tracked in electronic form with mobile and desktop organizers, so does the potential for software support for the corresponding tasks by means of intelligent agents. While there has been work in the area of personal assistants for to-do tasks, no work has focused on classifying user intention and information extraction as we do. We show that our methods perform well across two corpora that span sub-domains, one of which we released.

待办事项列表是个人信息管理的流行媒体。随着待办任务越来越多地以移动和桌面组织者的电子形式进行追踪，通过智能代理软件支持相应任务的潜力也越来越大。虽然在个人助理领域有待完成任务的工作，但没有任何工作集中于像我们一样对用户意图和信息抽取进行分类。我们表明，我们的方法在跨越子域的两个语料库中表现良好，其中一个我们发布。
