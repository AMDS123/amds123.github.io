##### Abstract
Creativity and the understanding of cognitive processes involved in the creative process are relevant to all of human activities. Comprehension of creativity in the arts is of special interest due to the involvement of many scientific and non scientific disciplines. Using digital representation of paintings, we show that creative process in painting art may be objectively recognized within the mathematical framework of self organization, a process characteristic of nonlinear dynamic systems and occurring in natural and social sciences. Unlike the artist identification process or the recognition of forgery, which presupposes the knowledge of the original work, our method requires no prior knowledge on the originality of the work of art. The original paintings are recognized as realizations of the creative process which, in general, is shown to correspond to self-organization of texture features which determine the aesthetic complexity of the painting. The method consists of the wavelet based statistical digital image processing and the measure of statistical complexity which represents the minimal (average) information necessary for optimal prediction. The statistical complexity is based on the properly defined causal states with optimal predictive properties. Two different time concepts related to the works of art are introduced: the internal time and the artistic time. The internal time of the artwork is determined by the span of causal dependencies between wavelet coefficients while the artistic time refers to the internal time during which complexity increases where complexity refers to compositional, aesthetic and structural arrangement of texture features. The method is illustrated by recognizing the original paintings from the copies made by the artists themselves, including the works of the famous surrealist painter Ren\'{e} Magritte.

参与创造过程的创造力和对认知过程的理解与所有人类活动有关。由于许多科学和非科学学科的参与，对艺术创造性的理解是特别有意义的。运用数字化的绘画表现手法，我们发现绘画艺术中的创作过程可以在自组织的数学框架内得到客观的认识，这是非线性动力系统的一个过程特征，并发生在自然科学和社会科学领域。我们的方法不同于艺术家识别过程或伪造品的识别，这是以原作品的知识为前提的，我们的方法不需要事先知道艺术品的原创性。原始绘画被认为是创造性过程的实现，一般而言，这些创作过程表现为与自然组织的纹理特征相对应，这决定了绘画的审美复杂性。该方法由基于小波的统计数字图像处理和统计复杂度的度量组成，其表示最优预测所需的最小（平均）信息。统计复杂性基于具有最佳预测属性的适当定义的因果状态。介绍了与艺术作品有关的两个不同的时间概念：内部时间和艺术时间。艺术品的内部时间由小波系数之间因果关系的范围决定，而艺术时间指复杂度增加的内部时间，其中复杂度指纹理特征的组成，美学和结构安排。通过对艺术家自己复制的原画进行认识，包括着名超现实主义画家马可里特（Ren \'Magritte）的作品，
