##### Abstract
The rolling shutter camera has received great attention due to its low cost imaging capability, however, the estimation of relative pose between rolling shutter cameras still remains a difficult problem owing to its line-by-line image capturing characteristics. To alleviate this problem, we exploit gyroscope measurements, angular velocity, along with image measurement to compute the relative pose between rolling shutter cameras. The gyroscope measurements provide the information about instantaneous motion that causes the rolling shutter distortion. Having gyroscope measurements in one hand, we simplify the relative pose estimation problem and find a minimal solution for the problem based on the Grobner basis polynomial solver. The proposed method requires only five points to compute relative pose between rolling shutter cameras, whereas previous methods require 20 or 44 corresponding points for linear and uniform rolling shutter geometry models, respectively. Experimental results on synthetic and real data verify the superiority of the proposed method over existing relative pose estimation methods.
