##### Abstract
Automatic service composition in mobile and pervasive computing faces many challenges due to the complex nature of the environment. Common approaches address service composition from optimization perspectives which are not feasible in practice due to the intractability of the problem, limited computational resources of smart devices, service host's mobility, and time constraints. Our main contribution is the development of a cognitively-inspired agent-based service composition model focused on bounded rationality rather than optimality, which allows the system to compensate for limited resources by selectively filtering out continuous streams of data. The evaluation of our approach shows promising results when compared against state-of-the-art service composition models.
