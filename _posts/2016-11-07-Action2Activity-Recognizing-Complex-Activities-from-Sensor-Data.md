##### Abstract
As compared to simple actions, activities are much more complex, but semantically consistent with a human's real life. Techniques for action recognition from sensor generated data are mature. However, there has been relatively little work on bridging the gap between actions and activities. To this end, this paper presents a novel approach for complex activity recognition comprising of two components. The first component is temporal pattern mining, which provides a mid-level feature representation for activities, encodes temporal relatedness among actions, and captures the intrinsic properties of activities. The second component is adaptive Multi-Task Learning, which captures relatedness among activities and selects discriminant features. Extensive experiments on a real-world dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our work.

与简单的行动相比，活动要复杂得多，但在语义上与人类的现实生活一致。传感器生成的数据动作识别技术是成熟的。但是，缩小行动和活动之间的差距的工作相对较少。为此，本文提出了一种用于复杂活动识别的新方法，由两部分组成。第一个组件是时间模式挖掘，它为活动提供了一个中级的特征表示，对行为之间的时间相关性进行了编码，并捕获了活动的固有属性。第二部分是自适应多任务学习，捕获活动之间的相关性并选择判别特征。对现实世界的数据集进行广泛的实验证明了我们工作的有效性。
