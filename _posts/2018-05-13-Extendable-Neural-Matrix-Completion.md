##### Abstract
Matrix completion is one of the key problems in signal processing and machine learning, with applications ranging from image pro- cessing and data gathering to classification and recommender sys- tems. Recently, deep neural networks have been proposed as la- tent factor models for matrix completion and have achieved state- of-the-art performance. Nevertheless, a major problem with existing neural-network-based models is their limited capabilities to extend to samples unavailable at the training stage. In this paper, we propose a deep two-branch neural network model for matrix completion. The proposed model not only inherits the predictive power of neural net- works, but is also capable of extending to partially observed samples outside the training set, without the need of retraining or fine-tuning. Experimental studies on popular movie rating datasets prove the ef- fectiveness of our model compared to the state of the art, in terms of both accuracy and extendability.

##### Abstract (translated by Google)
矩阵完成是信号处理和机器学习中的关键问题之一，其应用范围从图像处理和数据收集到分类和推荐系统。最近，深层神经网络已被提出作为矩阵完成的内在因子模型，并且已经实现了最先进的性能。尽管如此，现有的基于神经网络模型的一个主要问题是它们扩展到培训阶段不可用样本的能力有限。在本文中，我们提出了一个用于矩阵完成的深度两分支神经网络模型。所提出的模型不仅继承了神经网络的预测能力，而且还能够扩展到训练集外的部分观察样本，而无需再培训或微调。流行电影评级数据集的实验研究证明了我们的模型与现有技术相比在准确性和可扩展性方面的有效性。
