##### Abstract
Sentiment prediction of contemporary music can have a wide-range of applications in modern society, for instance, selecting music for public institutions such as hospitals or restaurants to potentially improve the emotional well-being of personnel, patients, and customers, respectively. In this project, music recommendation system built upon on a naive Bayes classifier, trained to predict the sentiment of songs based on song lyrics alone. The experimental results show that music corresponding to a happy mood can be detected with high precision based on text features obtained from song lyrics.

当代音乐的情感预测可以在现代社会有广泛的应用，例如为医院，饭店等公共机构选择音乐，可以分别提高人员，患者和顾客的情绪幸福感。在这个项目中，建立在朴素贝叶斯分类器基础上的音乐推荐系统，训练仅仅根据歌词来预测歌曲的情感。实验结果表明，基于从歌词中获得的文本特征，可以高精度地检测到对应于快乐心情的音乐。
