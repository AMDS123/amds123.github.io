##### Abstract
Sparse representation has been applied successfully in abnormal event detection, in which the baseline is to learn a dictionary accompanied by sparse codes. While much emphasis is put on discriminative dictionary construction, there are no comparative studies of sparse codes regarding abnormality detection. We comprehensively study two types of sparse codes solutions - greedy algorithms and convex L1-norm solutions - and their impact on abnormality detection performance. We also propose our framework of combining sparse codes with different detection methods. Our comparative experiments are carried out from various angles to better understand the applicability of sparse codes, including computation time, reconstruction error, sparsity, detection accuracy, and their performance combining various detection methods. Experiments show that combining OMP codes with maximum coordinate detection could achieve state-of-the-art performance on the UCSD dataset [14].

稀疏表示在异常事件检测中已经成功应用，其中基线是学习伴随着稀疏代码的字典。在重视辨别字典建设的同时，对于异常检测的稀疏编码还没有比较研究。我们综合研究了两种稀疏码解 - 贪心算法和凸L1范数解 - 及其对异常检测性能的影响。我们还提出了将稀疏编码与不同检测方法相结合的框架。为了更好地理解稀疏编码的适用性，包括计算时间，重构误差，稀疏性，检测精度和各种检测方法的性能，我们从各个角度进行了对比实验。实验表明，将OMP代码与最大坐标检测相结合，可以在UCSD数据集上获得最先进的性能[14]。
