##### Abstract
In LegenDary project, we started a new research based on Agent2D in RoboCup 2D soccer simulation. In this paper, we mainly present the team algorithms and structures which we used to develop our team in separated section. We have focused on passing, dribbling and blocking skills. We improved them and made the team ready for this competition. Through pass is the most important part of our team that we work a lot on it.
