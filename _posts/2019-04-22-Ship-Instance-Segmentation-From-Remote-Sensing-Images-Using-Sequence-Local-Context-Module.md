##### Abstract
The performance of object instance segmentation in remote sensing images has been greatly improved through the introduction of many landmark frameworks based on convolutional neural network. However, the object densely issue still affects the accuracy of such segmentation frameworks. Objects of the same class are easily confused, which is most likely due to the close docking between objects. We think context information is critical to address this issue. So, we propose a novel framework called SLCMASK-Net, in which a sequence local context module (SLC) is introduced to avoid confusion between objects of the same class. The SLC module applies a sequence of dilation convolution blocks to progressively learn multi-scale context information in the mask branch. Besides, we try to add SLC module to different locations in our framework and experiment with the effect of different parameter settings. Comparative experiments are conducted on remote sensing images acquired by QuickBird with a resolution of $0.5m-1m$ and the results show that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance.
