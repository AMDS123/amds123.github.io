##### Abstract
While neural networks have been used to classify or embed data into lower dimensional spaces, they are often regarded as black boxes with uninterpretable features. Here we propose a novel class of Graph Spectral Regularizations for making hidden layers interpretable --- and even informative of phenotypic state space. This regularization uses a graph Laplacian and encourages activations to be smooth either on a predetermined graph or on a feature-space graph learned from the data itself via co-activations of a hidden layer of the neural network. We show numerous uses for this including 1) cluster indication 2) trajectory finding and 3) visualization in biological and image data sets.
