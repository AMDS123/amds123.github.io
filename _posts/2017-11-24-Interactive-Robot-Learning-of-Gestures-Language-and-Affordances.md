##### Abstract
A growing field in robotics and Artificial Intelligence (AI) research is human-robot collaboration, whose target is to enable effective teamwork between humans and robots. However, in many situations human teams are still superior to human-robot teams, primarily because human teams can easily agree on a common goal with language, and the individual members observe each other effectively, leveraging their shared motor repertoire and sensorimotor resources. This paper shows that for cognitive robots it is possible, and indeed fruitful, to combine knowledge acquired from interacting with elements of the environment (affordance exploration) with the probabilistic observation of another agent's actions. We propose a model that unites (i) learning robot affordances and word descriptions with (ii) statistical recognition of human gestures with vision sensors. We discuss theoretical motivations, possible implementations, and we show initial results which highlight that, after having acquired knowledge of its surrounding environment, a humanoid robot can generalize this knowledge to the case when it observes another agent (human partner) performing the same motor actions previously executed during training.

机器人和人工智能（AI）研究领域的一个不断发展的领域是人机协作，其目标是实现人与机器人之间的有效协作。然而，在许多情况下，人力团队仍然优于人类机器人团队，主要原因是人类团队可以轻松达成与语言共同的目标，并且个人成员可以有效地观察彼此，利用他们共享的动力学曲目和感觉运动资源。本文表明，对于认知机器人来说，将与环境因素（可供性探索）相互作用所获得的知识与另一个行动者的概率观察相结合是可能的，而且的确是富有成效的。我们提出了一个模型，该模型将（i）学习机器人的可供性和字词描述与（ii）用视觉传感器对人类手势的统计识别相结合。我们讨论理论动机，可能的实现，并且我们展示初步的结果，强调在获得了周围环境的知识之后，类人机器人可以将这种知识推广到观察另一个执行相同运动行为的代理人先前在训练中执行。
