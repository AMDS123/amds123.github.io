##### Abstract
In music domain, feature learning has been conducted mainly in two ways: unsupervised learning based on sparse representations or supervised learning by semantic labels such as music genre. However, finding discriminative features in an unsupervised way is challenging and supervised feature learning using semantic labels may involve noisy or expensive annotation. In this paper, we present a supervised feature learning approach using artist labels annotated in every single track as objective meta data. We propose two deep convolutional neural networks (DCNN) to learn the deep artist features. One is a plain DCNN trained with the whole artist labels simultaneously, and the other is a Siamese DCNN trained with a subset of the artist labels based on the artist identity. We apply the trained models to music classification and retrieval tasks in transfer learning settings. The results show that our approach is comparable to previous state-of-the-art methods, indicating that the proposed approach captures general music audio features as much as the models learned with semantic labels. Also, we discuss the advantages and disadvantages of the two models.

在音乐领域，特征学习主要通过两种方式进行：基于稀疏表示的无监督学习或者通过诸如音乐类型等语义标签的监督学习。然而，以无监督的方式发现识别特征是具有挑战性的，并且使用语义标签的监督特征学习可能涉及嘈杂或昂贵的注释。在本文中，我们提出了一种监督式特征学习方法，使用在每个单曲中注释的艺术家标签作为客观元数据。我们提出两个深度卷积神经网络（DCNN）来学习深刻的艺术家特征。一个是一个纯粹的DCNN，同时用整个艺术家标签进行训练，另一个是一个Siamese DCNN，根据艺术家身份使用一组艺术家标签进行训练。我们将训练过的模型应用于转移学习设置中的音乐分类和检索任务。结果表明，我们的方法与先前的最先进的方法相当，表明所提出的方法捕​​捉通用音乐音频特征与用语义标签学习的模型一样多。另外，我们讨论这两种模型的优缺点。
