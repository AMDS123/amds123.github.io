##### Abstract
Despite the highest classification accuracy in wide varieties of application areas, artificial neural network has one disadvantage. The way this Network comes to a decision is not easily comprehensible. The lack of explanation ability reduces the acceptability of neural network in data mining and decision system. This drawback is the reason why researchers have proposed many rule extraction algorithms to solve the problem. Recently, Deep Neural Network (DNN) is achieving a profound result over the standard neural network for classification and recognition problems. It is a hot machine learning area proven both useful and innovative. This paper has thoroughly reviewed various rule extraction algorithms, considering the classification scheme: decompositional, pedagogical, and eclectics. It also presents the evaluation of these algorithms based on the neural network structure with which the algorithm is intended to work. The main contribution of this review is to show that there is a limited study of rule extraction algorithm from DNN.

尽管在广泛的应用领域中分类精度最高，但人工神经网络有一个缺点。这个网络做出决定的方式不容易理解。缺乏解释能力降低了神经网络在数据挖掘和决策系统中的可接受性。这个缺点是为什么研究人员提出了许多规则提取算法来解决这个问题。最近，深度神经网络（DNN）在标准神经网络的分类和识别问题上取得了深远的成果。这是一个热门的机器学习领域，既有用又创新。考虑到分类方法：分解，教学和折衷，本文对各种规则提取算法进行了深入的研究。它还提出了基于算法打算工作的神经网络结构对这些算法的评估。这篇综述的主要贡献是证明DNN对规则提取算法的研究有限。
