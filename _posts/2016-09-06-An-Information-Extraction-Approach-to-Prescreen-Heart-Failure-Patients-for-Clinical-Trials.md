##### Abstract
To reduce the large amount of time spent screening, identifying, and recruiting patients into clinical trials, we need prescreening systems that are able to automate the data extraction and decision-making tasks that are typically relegated to clinical research study coordinators. However, a major obstacle is the vast amount of patient data available as unstructured free-form text in electronic health records. Here we propose an information extraction-based approach that first automatically converts unstructured text into a structured form. The structured data are then compared against a list of eligibility criteria using a rule-based system to determine which patients qualify for enrollment in a heart failure clinical trial. We show that we can achieve highly accurate results, with recall and precision values of 0.95 and 0.86, respectively. Our system allowed us to significantly reduce the time needed for prescreening patients from a few weeks to a few minutes. Our open-source information extraction modules are available for researchers and could be tested and validated in other cardiovascular trials. An approach such as the one we demonstrate here may decrease costs and expedite clinical trials, and could enhance the reproducibility of trials across institutions and populations.

为了减少大量的筛查，鉴定和招募患者进入临床试验的时间，我们需要预筛选系统，这些系统能够自动化数据提取和决策任务，而这些任务通常归入临床研究协调员。但是，一个主要障碍是电子健康记录中的大量病人数据是非结构化的自由形式的文本。这里我们提出一种基于信息提取的方法，首先将非结构化文本自动转换为结构化表单。然后使用基于规则的系统将结构化数据与合格标准列表进行比较，以确定哪些患者有资格参加心力衰竭临床试验。我们表明，我们可以实现高度准确的结果，与召回和精度值分别为0.95和0.86。我们的系统使我们能够大大缩短患者从几周到几分钟的预筛选所需的时间。我们的开源信息提取模块可供研究人员使用，并可在其他心血管试验中进行测试和验证。我们在这里展示的方法可能会降低成本并加快临床试验，并可能提高跨机构和人群的试验的可重复性。
