##### Abstract
It is well known that sensors using strain gauges have a potential dependency on temperature. This creates temperature drift in the measurements of six axis force torque sensors (F/T). The temperature drift can be considerable if an experiment is long or the environmental conditions are different from when the calibration of the sensor was performed. Other \textit{in situ} methods disregard the effect of temperature on the sensor measurements. Experiments performed using the humanoid robot platform iCub show that the effect of temperature is relevant. The model based \textit{in situ} calibration of six axis force torque sensors method is extended to perform temperature compensation.
