##### Abstract
The complex organization of syntax in hierarchical structures is one of the core design features of human language. Duality of patterning refers for instance to the organization of the meaningful elements in a language at two distinct levels: a combinatorial level where meaningless forms are combined into meaningful forms and a compositional level where meaningful forms are composed into larger lexical units. The question remains wide open regarding how such a structure could have emerged. Furthermore a clear mathematical framework to quantify this phenomenon is still lacking. The aim of this paper is that of addressing these two aspects in a self-consistent way. First, we introduce suitable measures to quantify the level of combinatoriality and compositionality in a language, and present a framework to estimate these observables in human natural languages. Second, we show that the theoretical predictions of a multi-agents modeling scheme, namely the Blending Game, are in surprisingly good agreement with empirical data. In the Blending Game a population of individuals plays language games aiming at success in communication. It is remarkable that the two sides of duality of patterning emerge simultaneously as a consequence of a pure cultural dynamics in a simulated environment that contains meaningful relations, provided a simple constraint on message transmission fidelity is also considered.

##### Abstract (translated by Google)
层次结构中语法的复杂组织是人类语言的核心设计特征之一。模式化的二元性是指例如在一个语言中组织有意义的元素，在两个不同的层次上：一个组合的层面，无意义的形式被组合成有意义的形式，一个组成层面，有意义的形式被组合成更大的词汇单元。关于这种结构如何可能出现，问题仍然是广泛的。此外，还没有一个明确的数学框架来量化这一现象。本文的目的是以一致的方式处理这两个方面。首先，我们引入适当的措施来量化一种语言的组合性和组合性水平，并提出一个框架来估计这些人类自然语言的可观察性。其次，我们表明，多智能体建模方案的理论预测，即混合游戏，与经验数据惊人的一致。在混合游戏中，一群人玩语言游戏，旨在交流成功。值得注意的是，在包含有意义的关系的模拟环境中，模式的二元性的双方同时作为纯粹的文化动力的结果而出现，同时也考虑到对消息传递保真度的简单约束。
