##### Abstract
We investigate the capacity of mechanisms for compositional semantic parsing to describe relations between sentences and semantic representations. 
 We prove that in order to represent certain relations, mechanisms which are syntactically projective must be able to remember an unbounded number of locations in the semantic representations, where nonprojective mechanisms need not. 
 This is the first result of this kind, and has consequences both for grammar-based and for neural systems.
