##### Abstract
Deep-learning has proved in recent years to be a powerful tool for image analysis and is now widely used to segment both 2D and 3D medical images. Deep-learning segmentation frameworks rely not only on the choice of network architecture but also on the choice of loss function. When the segmentation process targets rare observations, a severe class imbalance is likely to occur between candidate labels, thus resulting in sub-optimal performance. In order to mitigate this issue, strategies such as the weighted cross-entropy function, the sensitivity function or the Dice loss function, have been proposed. In this work, we investigate the behavior of these loss functions and their sensitivity to learning rate tuning in the presence of different rates of label imbalance across 2D and 3D segmentation tasks. We also propose to use the class re-balancing properties of the Generalized Dice overlap, a known metric for segmentation assessment, as a robust and accurate deep-learning loss function for unbalanced tasks.

近年来，深度学习已经证明是图像分析的强大工具，现在已经广泛用于分割二维和三维医学图像。深度学习分割框架不仅依赖于网络体系结构的选择，还依赖于损失函数的选择。当分割过程针对罕见的观察时，候选标签之间可能出现严重的类别不平衡，从而导致次优性能。为了缓解这个问题，已经提出了诸如加权交叉熵函数，灵敏度函数或骰子损失函数的策略。在这项工作中，我们调查了这些损失函数的行为，以及在二维和三维分割任务中存在不同标签不平衡率情况下对学习速率调整的敏感性。我们还建议使用广义骰子重叠的类重新平衡属性作为不平衡任务的一个已知度量，作为一个强大而准确的深度学习损失函数。
