##### Abstract
Relighting is an essential step in artificially transferring an object from one image into another environment. For example, a believable teleconference in Augmented Reality requires a portrait recorded in the source environment to be displayed and relit consistent with the light configuration of the destination scene. 
 In this paper, we investigate architectures for learning to both de-light and relight an image of a human face end-to-end. The architectures vary in how much they enforce physically-based image formation and rendering constraints. The most structured model decomposes the input image into intrinsic components according to a diffuse physics-based image formation model and augments the render to relight including non-diffuse effects. An intermediate model uses fewer intrinsic constraints and the least structured model makes no assumptions on the image formation. 
 To train our models and evaluate the approach, we collected portraits of 21 subjects with various expressions and poses, each in a sequence of 32 individual light sources in a controlled light stage setup. Our method leads to precise and believable relighting results in challenging illumination conditions and poses, including when the subject is facing away from the camera. We compare our method to state-of-the-art relighting approaches and illustrate its superiority in a series of quantitative and qualitative experiments.
