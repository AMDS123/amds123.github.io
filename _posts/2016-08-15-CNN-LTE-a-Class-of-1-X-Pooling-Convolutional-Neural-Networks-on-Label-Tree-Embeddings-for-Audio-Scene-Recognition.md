##### Abstract
We describe in this report our audio scene recognition system submitted to the DCASE 2016 challenge. Firstly, given the label set of the scenes, a label tree is automatically constructed. This category taxonomy is then used in the feature extraction step in which an audio scene instance is represented by a label tree embedding image. Different convolutional neural networks, which are tailored for the task at hand, are finally learned on top of the image features for scene recognition. Our system reaches an overall recognition accuracy of 81.2% and 83.3% and outperforms the DCASE 2016 baseline with absolute improvements of 8.7% and 6.1% on the development and test data, respectively.

我们在本报告中描述了我们的音频场景识别系统提交给DCASE 2016的挑战。首先，给定场景的标签集，自动构建标签树。然后在特征提取步骤中使用该类别分类，其中音频场景实例由标签树嵌入图像表示。不同的卷积神经网络针对手头的任务进行量身定制，最终在场景识别的图像特征之上进行学习。我们的系统整体识别准确率达到81.2％和83.3％，优于DCASE 2016的基准，分别在开发和测试数据上分别提高了8.7％和6.1％。
