##### Abstract
Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are playing important roles in state-of-the-art visual recognition. This paper focuses on modeling the spatial co-occurrence of neuron responses, which is less studied in the previous work. For this, we consider the neurons in the hidden layer as neural words, and construct a set of geometric neural phrases on top of them. The idea that grouping neural words into neural phrases is borrowed from the Bag-of-Visual-Words (BoVW) model. Next, the Geometric Neural Phrase Pooling (GNPP) algorithm is proposed to efficiently encode these neural phrases. GNPP acts as a new type of hidden layer, which punishes the isolated neuron responses after convolution, and can be inserted into a CNN model with little extra computational overhead. Experimental results show that GNPP produces significant and consistent accuracy gain in image classification.

深度卷积神经网络（CNN）在最先进的视觉识别中发挥着重要的作用。本文着重于对神经元反应的空间共现进行建模，这在以前的工作中是较少研究的。为此，我们将隐藏层中的神经元视为神经词，并在其上构建一组几何神经短语。将神经词语分组为神经短语的想法是从视觉词袋（BoVW）模型中借鉴的。接下来，提出几何神经短语集合（GNPP）算法来有效地编码这些神经短语。 GNPP作为一种新型的隐藏层，惩罚卷积后的孤立的神经元响应，并且可以插入到CNN模型中，而只需要额外的计算开销。实验结果表明，GNPP在图像分类中产生了显着而一致的准确性增益。
