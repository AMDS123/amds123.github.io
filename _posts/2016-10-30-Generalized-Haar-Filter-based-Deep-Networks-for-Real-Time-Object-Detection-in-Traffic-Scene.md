##### Abstract
Vision-based object detection is one of the fundamental functions in numerous traffic scene applications such as self-driving vehicle systems and advance driver assistance systems (ADAS). However, it is also a challenging task due to the diversity of traffic scene and the storage, power and computing source limitations of the platforms for traffic scene applications. This paper presents a generalized Haar filter based deep network which is suitable for the object detection tasks in traffic scene. In this approach, we first decompose a object detection task into several easier local regression tasks. Then, we handle the local regression tasks by using several tiny deep networks which simultaneously output the bounding boxes, categories and confidence scores of detected objects. To reduce the consumption of storage and computing resources, the weights of the deep networks are constrained to the form of generalized Haar filter in training phase. Additionally, we introduce the strategy of sparse windows generation to improve the efficiency of the algorithm. Finally, we perform several experiments to validate the performance of our proposed approach. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach is both efficient and effective in traffic scene compared with the state-of-the-art.

基于视觉的目标检测是许多交通场景应用中的基本功能之一，例如自驾车辆系统和高级驾驶员辅助系统（ADAS）。然而，由于交通场景的多样性以及交通场景应用平台的存储，功耗和计算资源的限制，这也是一个具有挑战性的任务。本文提出了一种适用于交通场景中物体检测任务的广义哈尔滤波器深度网络。在这种方法中，我们首先将一个对象检测任务分解成几个更容易的本地回归任务。然后，我们使用几个微小的深度网络来处理局部回归任务，这些网络同时输出检测对象的边界框，类别和置信度。为了减少存储和计算资源的消耗，深度网络的权重在训练阶段被限制为广义哈尔滤波器的形式。另外，我们引入稀疏窗口生成策略来提高算法的效率。最后，我们进行了几个实验来验证我们提出的方法的性能。实验结果表明，与现有技术相比，所提出的方法在交通场景中既高效又有效。
