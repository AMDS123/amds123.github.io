##### Abstract
Community question-answering (CQA) platforms have become very popular forums for asking and answering questions daily. While these forums are rich repositories of community knowledge, they present challenges for finding relevant answers and similar questions, due to the open-ended nature of informal discussions. Further, if the platform allows questions and answers in multiple languages, we are faced with the additional challenge of matching cross-lingual information. In this work, we focus on the cross-language question re-ranking shared task, which aims to find existing questions that may be written in different languages. Our contribution is an exploration of query expansion techniques for this problem. We investigate expansions based on Word Embeddings, DBpedia concepts linking, and Hypernym, and show that they outperform existing state-of-the-art methods.
