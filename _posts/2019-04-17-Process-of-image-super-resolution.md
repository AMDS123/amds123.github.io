##### Abstract
In this paper we explain a process of super-resolution reconstruction allowing to increase the resolution of an image.The need for high-resolution digital images exists in diverse domains, for example the medical and spatial domains. The obtaining of high-resolution digital images can be made at the time of the shooting, but it is often synonymic of important costs because of the necessary material to avoid such costs, it is known how to use methods of super-resolution reconstruction, consisting from one or several low resolution images to obtain a high-resolution image. The american patent US 9 208 537 describes such an algorithm. A zone of one low-resolution image is isolated and categorized according to the information contained in pixels forming the borders of the zone. The category of it zone determines the type of interpolation used to add pixels in aforementioned zone, to increase the neatness of the images. It is also known how to reconstruct a low-resolution image there high-resolution image by using a model of super-resolution reconstruction whose learning is based on networks of neurons and on image or a picture library. The demand of chinese patent CN 107563965 and the scientist publication "Pixel Recursive Super Resolution", R. Dahl, M. Norouzi, J. Shlens propose such methods.
