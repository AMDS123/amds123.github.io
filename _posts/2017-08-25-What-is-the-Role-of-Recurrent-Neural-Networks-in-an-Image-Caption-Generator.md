##### Abstract
In neural image captioning systems, a recurrent neural network (RNN) is typically viewed as the primary `generation' component. This view suggests that the image features should be `injected' into the RNN. This is in fact the dominant view in the literature. Alternatively, the RNN can instead be viewed as only encoding the previously generated words. This view suggests that the RNN should only be used to encode linguistic features and that only the final representation should be `merged' with the image features at a later stage. This paper compares these two architectures. We find that, in general, late merging outperforms injection, suggesting that RNNs are better viewed as encoders, rather than generators.

在神经图像字幕系统中，递归神经网络（RNN）通常被视为主要的“生成”组件。该视图表明图像特征应该“注入”RNN。这实际上是文献中的主流观点。或者，RNN可以被视为仅编码先前生成的单词。该视图表明RNN仅应用于编码语言特征，并且只有最终表示应在稍后阶段与图像特征“合并”。本文对这两种架构进行了比较。我们发现，一般来说，后期合并优于注入，这表明RNN更好地被视为编码器而不是发电机。
