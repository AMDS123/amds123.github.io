##### Abstract
Job search through online matching engines nowadays are very prominent and beneficial to both job seekers and employers. But the solutions of traditional engines without understanding the semantic meanings of different resumes have not kept pace with the incredible changes in machine learning techniques and computing capability. These solutions are usually driven by manual rules and predefined weights of keywords which lead to an inefficient and frustrating search experience. To this end, we present a machine learned solution with rich features and deep learning methods. Our solution includes three configurable modules that can be plugged with little restrictions. Namely, unsupervised feature extraction, base classifiers training and ensemble method learning. In our solution, rather than using manual rules, machine learned methods to automatically detect the semantic similarity of positions are proposed. Then four competitive "shallow" estimators and "deep" estimators are selected. Finally, ensemble methods to bag these estimators and aggregate their individual predictions to form a final prediction are verified. Experimental results of over 47 thousand resumes show that our solution can significantly improve the predication precision current position, salary, educational background and company scale.

现在通过在线匹配引擎进行的求职非常突出，对求职者和雇主都有好处。但传统引擎的解决方案却不了解不同简历的语义，跟不上机器学习技术和计算能力的难以置信的变化。这些解决方案通常是由手动规则和预定义的关键字权重驱动的，导致搜索体验效率低下，令人沮丧。为此，我们提供了一个丰富的功能和深度学习方法的机器学习解决方案。我们的解决方案包括三个可配置的模块，可以插入很小的限制。即无监督特征提取，基本分类器训练和集成方法学习。在我们的解决方案中，不是使用手工规则，而是提出机器学习方法来自动检测位置的语义相似性。然后选择四个竞争性“浅”估计量和“深度”估计量。最后，集合方法来收集这些估计量并聚合它们的个体预测以形成最终的预测。超过47000份简历的实验结果表明，我们的解决方案可以显着提高预测精度的当前位置，工资，教育背景和公司规模。
