##### Abstract
eSports is the rapidly developing multidisciplinary domain. However, research and experimentation in eSports are in the infancy. In this work, we propose a smart chair platform - an unobtrusive approach to the collection of data on the eSports athletes and data further processing with machine learning methods. The use case scenario involves three groups of players: `cyber athletes' (Monolith team), semi-professional players and newbies all playing CS:GO discipline. In particular, we collect data from the accelerometer and gyroscope integrated in the chair and apply machine learning algorithms for the data analysis. Our results demonstrate that the professional athletes can be identified by their behaviour on the chair while playing the game.
