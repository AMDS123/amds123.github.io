##### Abstract
This paper proposes a novel advanced motion model to handle the irregular motion for the cubic map projection of 360-degree video. Since the irregular motion is mainly caused by the projection from the sphere to the cube map, we first try to project the pixels in both the current picture and reference picture from unfolding cube back to the sphere. Then through utilizing the characteristic that most of the motions in the sphere are uniform, we can derive the relationship between the motion vectors of various pixels in the unfold cube. The proposed advanced motion model is implemented in the High Efficiency Video Coding reference software. Experimental results demonstrate that quite obvious performance improvement can be achieved for the sequences with obvious motions.

本文提出了一种新颖的高级运动模型来处理360度视频立体地图投影的不规则运动。由于不规则运动主要是由球面投影到立方体贴图造成的，我们首先尝试将当前图像和参考图像中的像素从展开立方体投影到球体。然后通过利用球体中大部分运动均匀的特性，可以推导出展开立方体中各像素的运动矢量之间的关系。所提出的高级运动模型是在高效率视频编码参考软件中实现的。实验结果表明，对于运动明显的序列，可以达到非常明显的性能提升。
