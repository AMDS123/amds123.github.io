##### Abstract
A theoretical and experimental analysis related to the identification of vertices of unknown shapes is presented. Shapes are seen as real functions of their closed boundary. Unlike traditional approaches, which see curvature as the rate of change of the tangent to the curve, an alternative global perspective of curvature is examined providing insight into the process of noise-enabled vertex localization. The analysis leads to a paradox, that certain vertices can be localized better in the presence of noise. The concept of noising is thus considered and a relevant global method for localizing "Global Vertices" is investigated. Theoretical analysis reveals that induced noise can help localizing certain vertices if combined with global descriptors. Experiments with noise and a comparison to localized methods validate the theoretical results.

##### Abstract (translated by Google)
给出了与未知形状顶点的识别有关的理论和实验分析。形状被视为其封闭边界的实际功能。不同于传统的方法，即将曲率视为曲线切线的变化率，研究了曲率的另一种全局视角，从而深入了解了启用噪声的顶点定位过程。分析导致了一个悖论，即某些顶点在噪声的存在下可以更好地局部化。因此，考虑了噪声的概念，并研究了“全局顶点”本地化的相关全局方法。理论分析表明，与全局描述符结合，感应噪声可以帮助定位某些顶点。噪声实验和本地化方法的比较验证了理论结果。
