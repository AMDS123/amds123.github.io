##### Abstract
Deep learning approaches to cyclone intensity estimationhave recently shown promising results. However, sufferingfrom the extreme scarcity of cyclone data on specific in-tensity, most existing deep learning methods fail to achievesatisfactory performance on cyclone intensity estimation,especially on classes with few instances. To avoid the degra-dation of recognition performance caused by scarce samples,we propose a context-aware CycleGAN which learns the la-tent evolution features from adjacent cyclone intensity andsynthesizes CNN features of classes lacking samples fromunpaired source classes. Specifically, our approach synthe-sizes features conditioned on the learned evolution features,while the extra information is not required. Experimentalresults of several evaluation methods show the effectivenessof our approach, even can predicting unseen classes.
