##### Abstract
Ultrasound imaging plays an important role in breast lesion differentiation. However, diagnostic accuracy depends on ultrasonographer experience. Various computer aided diagnosis systems has been developed to improve breast cancer detection and reduce the number of unnecessary biopsies. In this study, our aim was to improve breast lesion classification based on the BI-RADS (Breast Imaging - Reporting and Data System). This was accomplished by combining the BI-RADS with morphological features which assess lesion boundary. A dataset of 214 lesion images was used for analysis. 30 morphological features were extracted and feature selection scheme was applied to find features which improve the BI-RADS classification performance. Additionally, the best performing morphological feature subset was indicated. We obtained a better classification by combining the BI-RADS with six morphological features. These features were the extent, overlap ratio, NRL entropy, circularity, elliptic-normalized circumference and the normalized residual value. The area under the receiver operating curve calculated with the use of the combined classifier was 0.986. The best performing morphological feature subset contained six features: the DWR, NRL entropy, normalized residual value, overlap ratio, extent and the morphological closing ratio. For this set, the area under the curve was 0.901. The combination of the radiologist's experience related to the BI-RADS and the morphological features leads to a more effective breast lesion classification.

超声成像在乳房病变分化中起重要作用。但是，诊断的准确性取决于超声检查者的经验。已经开发了各种计算机辅助诊断系统来改善乳腺癌检测并减少不必要的活组织检查的次数。在这项研究中，我们的目标是改善基于BI-RADS（乳房成像 - 报告和数据系统）的乳房病变分类。这是通过将BI-RADS与评估病变边界的形态学特征相结合而完成的。使用214个病灶图像的数据集进行分析。提取了30个形态特征，应用特征选择方法寻找提高BI-RADS分类性能的特征。此外，表现最好的形态特征子集。通过将BI-RADS与六种形态特征相结合，我们获得了更好的分类。这些特征是程度，重叠比，NRL熵，圆度，椭圆归一化周长和归一化残差值。使用组合分类器计算的受试者操作曲线下面积为0.986。表现最好的形态特征子集包含了DWR，NRL熵，归一化残差值，重叠比，范围和形态闭合比等6个特征。对于这一组，曲线下面积是0.901。放射科医师与BI-RADS相关的经验和形态学特征相结合，可以更有效地进行乳房病变分类。
