##### Abstract
Domain adaptation algorithms are useful when the distributions of the training and the test data are different. In this paper, we focus on the problem of instrumental variation and time-varying drift in the field of sensors and measurement, which can be viewed as discrete and continuous distributional change in the feature space. We propose maximum independence domain adaptation (MIDA) and semi-supervised MIDA (SMIDA) to address this problem. Domain features are first defined to describe the background information of a sample, such as the device label and acquisition time. Then, MIDA learns a subspace which has maximum independence with the domain features, so as to reduce the inter-domain discrepancy in distributions. A feature augmentation strategy is also designed to project samples according to their backgrounds so as to improve the adaptation. The proposed algorithms are flexible and fast. Their effectiveness is verified by experiments on synthetic datasets and four real-world ones on sensors, measurement, and computer vision. They can greatly enhance the practicability of sensor systems, as well as extend the application scope of existing domain adaptation algorithms by uniformly handling different kinds of distributional change.

当训练和测试数据的分布不同时，域自适应算法是有用的。本文着重研究传感器和测量领域中的仪器变化和时变漂移问题，可以看作是特征空间中离散且连续的分布变化。我们提出最大独立域适配（MIDA）和半监督MIDA（SMIDA）来解决这个问题。域特征首先被定义为描述样本的背景信息，例如设备标签和获取时间。然后，MIDA学习一个与域特征具有最大独立性的子空间，从而减少域间的分布差异。特征增强策略也被设计为根据其背景来投射样本以改善适应性。所提出的算法灵活快速。他们的有效性通过在合成数据集上的实验以及在传感器，测量和计算机视觉领域的四个实际应用验证。它们可以大大提高传感器系统的实用性，并且通过统一处理不同类型的分布式变化来扩展现有的域自适应算法的应用范围。
