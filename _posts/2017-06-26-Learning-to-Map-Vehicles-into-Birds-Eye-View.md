##### Abstract
Awareness of the road scene is an essential component for both autonomous vehicles and Advances Driver Assistance Systems and is gaining importance both for the academia and car companies. This paper presents a way to learn a semantic-aware transformation which maps detections from a dashboard camera view onto a broader bird's eye occupancy map of the scene. To this end, a huge synthetic dataset featuring 1M couples of frames, taken from both car dashboard and bird's eye view, has been collected and automatically annotated. A deep-network is then trained to warp detections from the first to the second view. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our model against several baselines and observe that is able to generalize on real-world data despite having been trained solely on synthetic ones.

对道路现场的了解是自动驾驶汽车和驾驶辅助系统的重要组成部分，对于学术界和汽车公司来说都非常重要。本文提供了一种学习语义感知转换的方法，该转换将来自仪表板相机视图的检测映射到场景的更广泛的鸟眼占用图上。为此，已经收集并自动注释了一个由汽车仪表板和鸟瞰图组成的1M对夫妇帧的大型合成数据集。然后训练一个深层网络，从第一个视图到第二个视图的检测。我们证明了我们的模型对几个基线的有效性，并观察到，尽管已经完全依靠合成数据进行了训练，但仍能够对现实世界的数据进行概括。
