##### Abstract
Epidemic intelligence deals with the detection of disease outbreaks using formal (such as hospital records) and informal sources (such as user-generated text on the web) of information. In this survey, we discuss approaches for epidemic intelligence that use textual datasets, referring to it as `text-based epidemic intelligence'. We view past work in terms of two broad categories: health mention classification (selecting relevant text from a large volume) and health event detection (predicting epidemic events from a collection of relevant text). The focus of our discussion is the underlying computational linguistic techniques in the two categories. The survey also provides details of the state-of-the-art in annotation techniques, resources and evaluation strategies for epidemic intelligence.
