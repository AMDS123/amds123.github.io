##### Abstract
Spatiotemporal human representation based on 3D visual perception data is a rapidly growing research area. Based on the information sources, these representations can be broadly categorized into two groups based on RGB-D information or 3D skeleton data. Recently, skeleton-based human representations have been intensively studied and kept attracting an increasing attention, due to their robustness to variations of viewpoint, human body scale and motion speed as well as the realtime, online performance. This paper presents a comprehensive survey of existing space-time representations of people based on 3D skeletal data, and provides an informative categorization and analysis of these methods from the perspectives, including information modality, representation encoding, structure and transition, and feature engineering. We also provide a brief overview of skeleton acquisition devices and construction methods, enlist a number of public benchmark datasets with skeleton data, and discuss potential future research directions.

基于三维视觉感知数据的时空人体表示是一个快速发展的研究领域。根据信息来源，这些表示可以基于RGB-D信息或3D骨架数据大致分为两组。近年来，基于骨架的人体表征由于其对视点变化，人体尺度和运动速度的鲁棒性以及实时性，在线性能等方面的深入研究而不断受到关注。本文以三维骨架数据为基础，对人们现有的时空表征进行了全面的调查，并从信息形态，表征编码，结构与过渡，特征工程等角度对这些方法进行了信息分类与分析。我们还提供了骨架采集设备和构建方法的简要概述，收集了一些公共基准数据集与骨架数据，并讨论未来可能的研究方向。
