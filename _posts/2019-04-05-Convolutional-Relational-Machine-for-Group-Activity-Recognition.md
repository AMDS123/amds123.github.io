##### Abstract
We present an end-to-end deep Convolutional Neural Network called Convolutional Relational Machine (CRM) for recognizing group activities that utilizes the information in spatial relations between individual persons in image or video. It learns to produce an intermediate spatial representation (activity map) based on individual and group activities. A multi-stage refinement component is responsible for decreasing the incorrect predictions in the activity map. Finally, an aggregation component uses the refined information to recognize group activities. Experimental results demonstrate the constructive contribution of the information extracted and represented in the form of the activity map. CRM shows advantages over state-of-the-art models on Volleyball and Collective Activity datasets.
