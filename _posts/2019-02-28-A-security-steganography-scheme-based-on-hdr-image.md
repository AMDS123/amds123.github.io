##### Abstract
It is widely recognized that the image format is crucial to steganography for that each individual format has its unique properities. Nowadays, the most famous approach of digital image steganography is to combine a well-defined distortion function with efficient practical codes such as STC. And numerous researches are concentrated on spatial domain and jpeg domain. However, whether in spatial domain or jpeg domain, high payload (e.g., 0.5 bit per pixel) is not secure enough. In this paper, we propose a novel adaptive steganography scheme based on 32-bit HDR (High dynamic range) format and Norm IEEE 754. Experiments show that the steganographic method can achieve satisfactory security under payload from 0.3bpp to 0.5bpp.
