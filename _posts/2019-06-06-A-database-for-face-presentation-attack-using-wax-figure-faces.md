##### Abstract
Compared to 2D face presentation attacks (e.g. printed photos and video replays), 3D type attacks are more challenging to face recognition systems (FRS) by presenting 3D characteristics or materials similar to real faces. Existing 3D face spoofing databases, however, mostly based on 3D masks, are restricted to small data size or poor authenticity due to the production difficulty and high cost. In this work, we introduce the first wax figure face database, WFFD, as one type of super-realistic 3D presentation attacks to spoof the FRS. This database consists of 2200 images with both real and wax figure faces (totally 4400 faces) with a high diversity from online collections. Experiments on this database first investigate the vulnerability of three popular FRS to this kind of new attack. Further, we evaluate the performance of several face presentation attack detection methods to show the attack abilities of this super-realistic face spoofing database.
