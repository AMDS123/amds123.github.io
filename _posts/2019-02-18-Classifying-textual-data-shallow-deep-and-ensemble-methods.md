##### Abstract
This paper focuses on a comparative evaluation of the most common and modern methods for text classification, including the recent deep learning strategies and ensemble methods. The study is motivated by a challenging real data problem, characterized by high-dimensional and extremely sparse data, deriving from incoming calls to the customer care of an Italian phone company. We will show that deep learning outperforms many classical (shallow) strategies but the combination of shallow and deep learning methods in a unique ensemble classifier may improve the robustness and the accuracy of "single" classification methods.
