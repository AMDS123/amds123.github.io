##### Abstract
Protein tertiary structure defines its functions, classification and binding sites. Similar structural characteristics between two proteins often lead to the similar characteristics thereof. Determining structural similarity accurately in real time is a crucial research issue. In this paper, we present a novel and effective scoring scheme that is dependent on novel features extracted from protein alpha carbon distance matrices. Our scoring scheme is inspired from pattern recognition and computer vision. Our method is significantly better than the current state of the art methods in terms of family match of pairs of protein structures and other statistical measurements. The effectiveness of our method is tested on standard benchmark structures. A web service is available at this http URL where you can get the similarity measurement score between two protein structures based on our method.

蛋白质三级结构定义其功能，分类和结合位点。两种蛋白质之间的相似的结构特征通常导致其相似的特征。准确地实时确定结构相似性是一个至关重要的研究问题。在本文中，我们提出了一种新颖有效的评分方案，它依赖于从蛋白质α碳距离矩阵中提取的新特征。我们的评分方案受模式识别和计算机视觉的启发。就蛋白质结构对的家族匹配和其他统计测量而言，我们的方法明显优于现有技术的方法。我们的方法的有效性在标准基准结构上进行测试。这个http URL提供了一个web服务，您可以根据我们的方法获得两个蛋白质结构之间的相似性测量分数。
