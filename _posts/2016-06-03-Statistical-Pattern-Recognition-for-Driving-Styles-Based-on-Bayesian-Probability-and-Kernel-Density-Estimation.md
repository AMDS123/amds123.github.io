##### Abstract
Driving styles have a great influence on vehicle fuel economy, active safety, and drivability. To recognize driving styles of path-tracking behaviors for different divers, a statistical pattern-recognition method is developed to deal with the uncertainty of driving styles or characteristics based on probability density estimation. First, to describe driver path-tracking styles, vehicle speed and throttle opening are selected as the discriminative parameters, and a conditional kernel density function of vehicle speed and throttle opening is built, respectively, to describe the uncertainty and probability of two representative driving styles, e.g., aggressive and normal. Meanwhile, a posterior probability of each element in feature vector is obtained using full Bayesian theory. Second, a Euclidean distance method is involved to decide to which class the driver should be subject instead of calculating the complex covariance between every two elements of feature vectors. By comparing the Euclidean distance between every elements in feature vector, driving styles are classified into seven levels ranging from low normal to high aggressive. Subsequently, to show benefits of the proposed pattern-recognition method, a cross-validated method is used, compared with a fuzzy logic-based pattern-recognition method. The experiment results show that the proposed statistical pattern-recognition method for driving styles based on kernel density estimation is more efficient and stable than the fuzzy logic-based method.

驾驶风格对车辆的燃油经济性，主动安全性和驾驶性能有很大的影响。为了识别不同潜水员的路径跟踪行为的驾驶风格，基于概率密度估计，开发了统计模式识别方法来处理驾驶风格或特征的不确定性。首先描述驾驶员的路径跟踪风格，选择车速和油门开度作为判别参数，分别建立车速和油门开度的条件核密度函数，分别描述两种典型驾驶风格的不确定性和概率，例如，积极和正常。同时，利用全贝叶斯理论得到特征向量中每个元素的后验概率。其次，欧几里德距离方法涉及决定驱动程序应该接受哪个类，而不是计算特征向量的每两个元素之间的复数协方差。通过比较特征向量中各元素之间的欧氏距离，将驾驶风格分为从低到高的七个级别。随后，为了展示所提出的模式识别方法的益处，使用交叉验证方法，与基于模糊逻辑的模式识别方法相比较。实验结果表明，所提出的基于核密度估计的驾驶风格统计模式识别方法比基于模糊逻辑的方法更加高效稳定。
