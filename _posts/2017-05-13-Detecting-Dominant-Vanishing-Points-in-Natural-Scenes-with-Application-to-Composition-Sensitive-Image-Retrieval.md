##### Abstract
Linear perspective is widely used in landscape photography to create the impression of depth on a 2D photo. Automated understanding of linear perspective in landscape photography has several real-world applications, including aesthetics assessment, image retrieval, and on-site feedback for photo composition, yet adequate automated understanding has been elusive. We address this problem by detecting the dominant vanishing point and the associated line structures in a photo. However, natural landscape scenes pose great technical challenges because often the inadequate number of strong edges converging to the dominant vanishing point is inadequate. To overcome this difficulty, we propose a novel vanishing point detection method that exploits global structures in the scene via contour detection. We show that our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods on a public ground truth landscape image dataset that we have created. Based on the detection results, we further demonstrate how our approach to linear perspective understanding provides on-site guidance to amateur photographers on their work through a novel viewpoint-specific image retrieval system.

线性透视被广泛用于风景摄影，以在2D照片上创造深度印象。对景观摄影线性视角的自动理解有几个现实世界的应用，包括美学评估，图像检索和照片合成的现场反馈，但是足够的自动化理解已经难以实现。我们通过检测照片中的主要消失点和相关联的线结构来解决这个问题。然而，自然景观场景在技术上面临很大的挑战，因为通常没有足够数量的强边缘趋于主导的消失点。为了克服这个困难，我们提出了一种新的消失点检测方法，通过轮廓检测来利用场景中的全局结构。我们表明，我们的方法在我们创建的公共地面真实景观图像数据集上明显优于最先进的方法。基于检测结果，我们进一步展示了我们的线性视角理解方法如何通过新颖的视点特定图像检索系统为业余摄影师提供现场指导。
