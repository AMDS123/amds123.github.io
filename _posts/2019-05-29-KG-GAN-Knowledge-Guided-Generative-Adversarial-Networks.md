##### Abstract
Generative adversarial networks (GANs) learn to mimic training data that represents the underlying true data distribution. However, GANs suffer when the training data lacks quantity or diversity and therefore cannot represent the underlying distribution well. To improve the performance of GANs trained on under-represented training data distributions, this paper proposes KG-GAN to fuse domain knowledge with the GAN framework. KG-GAN trains two generators; one learns from data while the other learns from knowledge. To achieve KG-GAN, domain knowledge is formulated as a constraint function to guide the learning of the second generator. We validate our framework on two tasks: fine-grained image generation and hair recoloring. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of KG-GAN.
