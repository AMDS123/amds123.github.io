##### Abstract
Fishery surveys that call for the use of single or multiple underwater cameras have been an emerging technology as a non-extractive mean to estimate the abundance of fish stocks. Tracking live fish in an open aquatic environment posts challenges that are different from general pedestrian or vehicle tracking in surveillance applications. In many rough habitats fish are monitored by cameras installed on moving platforms, where tracking is even more challenging due to inapplicability of background models. In this paper, a novel tracking algorithm based on the deformable multiple kernels (DMK) is proposed to address these challenges. Inspired by the deformable part model (DPM) technique, a set of kernels is defined to represent the holistic object and several parts that are arranged in a deformable configuration. Color histogram, texture histogram and the histogram of oriented gradients (HOG) are extracted and serve as object features. Kernel motion is efficiently estimated by the mean-shift algorithm on color and texture features to realize tracking. Furthermore, the HOG-feature deformation costs are adopted as soft constraints on kernel positions to maintain the part configuration. Experimental results on practical video set from underwater moving cameras show the reliable performance of the proposed method with much less computational cost comparing with state-of-the-art techniques.

要求使用单个或多个水下摄像机的渔业调查已经成为一种新兴的技术，作为估计鱼类资源丰度的一种非抽取手段。跟踪开放的水生环境中的活鱼在监视应用中提出了与普通行人或车辆跟踪不同的挑战。在许多恶劣的环境中，鱼类通过安装在移动平台上的摄像头进行监控，由于背景模型的不适用性，跟踪更具挑战性。本文提出了一种基于可变形多核（DMK）的新型跟踪算法来解决这些难题。受可变形零件模型（DPM）技术的启发，定义了一组内核来表示整体对象和几个以可变形配置排列的部件。提取颜色直方图，纹理直方图和方向梯度直方图（HOG）作为对象特征。通过颜色和纹理特征的均值漂移算法有效估计核运动，实现跟踪。此外，采用HOG特征变形成本作为内核位置的软约束来维持部件配置。从水下移动摄像机的实际视频集的实验结果表明，与现有技术相比，所提出的方法具有可靠的性能，计算成本更低。
