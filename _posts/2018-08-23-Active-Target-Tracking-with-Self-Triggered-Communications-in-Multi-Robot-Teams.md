##### Abstract
We study the problem of reducing the amount of communication in decentralized target tracking. We focus on the scenario where a team of robots are allowed to move on the boundary of the environment. Their goal is to seek a formation so as to best track a target moving in the interior of the environment. The robots are capable of measuring distances to the target. Decentralized control strategies have been proposed in the past that guarantee that the robots asymptotically converge to the optimal formation. However, existing methods require that the robots exchange information with their neighbors at all time steps. Instead, we focus on decentralized strategies to reduce the amount of communication among robots. 
 We propose a self-triggered communication strategy that decides when a particular robot should seek up-to-date information from its neighbors and when it is safe to operate with possibly outdated information. We prove that this strategy converges asymptotically to a desired formation when the target is stationary. For the case of a mobile target, we propose an extension whereby each robot decides its optimal partner to share its measurements with using observability as a criterion. We evaluate all the approaches (constant communication and self-triggered communication with centralized and decentralized sensor fusion) through simulations.

我们研究了减少分散目标跟踪中的通信量的问题。我们关注的是允许机器人团队在环境边界上移动的情况。他们的目标是寻找一个阵型，以便最好地跟踪在环境内部移动的目标。机器人能够测量到目标的距离。过去已经提出了分散控制策略，其保证机器人渐近地收敛到最优形成。然而，现有方法要求机器人在所有时间步骤与其邻居交换信息。相反，我们专注于分散策略，以减少机器人之间的通信量。
 我们提出了一种自触发通信策略，该策略决定特定机器人何时应该从其邻居那里寻找最新信息，以及何时可以安全地操作可能过时的信息。我们证明了当目标静止时，该策略渐近地收敛到期望的阵型。对于移动目标的情况，我们建议扩展，每个机器人通过使用可观察性作为标准来决定其最佳伙伴以共享其测量。我们通过模拟评估所有方法（通过集中和分散传感器融合的持续通信和自触发通信）。
