##### Abstract
Analyses of text corpora over time can reveal trends in beliefs, interest, and sentiment about a topic. We focus on views expressed about artificial intelligence (AI) in the New York Times over a 30-year period. General interest, awareness, and discussion about AI has waxed and waned since the field was founded in 1956. We present a set of measures that captures levels of engagement, measures of pessimism and optimism, the prevalence of specific hopes and concerns, and topics that are linked to discussions about AI over decades. We find that discussion of AI has increased sharply since 2009, and that these discussions have been consistently more optimistic than pessimistic. However, when we examine specific concerns, we find that worries of loss of control of AI, ethical concerns for AI, and the negative impact of AI on work have grown in recent years. We also find that hopes for AI in healthcare and education have increased over time.

随着时间的推移文本语料库的分析可以揭示关于一个话题的信念，兴趣和情绪的趋势。我们关注30年来“纽约时报”对人工智能（AI）的观点。自1956年成立以来，人们对AI的普遍兴趣，认识和讨论已经上升和下降。我们提出了一系列的参与度，悲观和乐观度量，具体的希望和关注的流行程度，与几十年来关于人工智能的讨论有关。我们发现自2009年以来人工智能的讨论急剧增加，而且这些讨论比悲观持续更为乐观。然而，当我们研究具体的问题时，我们发现人工智能失控，人工智能的伦理问题以及人工智能对工作负面影响的担忧近年来有所增加。我们也发现人工智能在医疗和教育方面的希望随着时间的推移而增加。
