##### Abstract
The practical aspects of developing an Automatic Speech Recognition System (ASR) with HTK are reviewed. Steps are explained concerning hardware, software, libraries, applications and computer programs used. The common procedure to rapidly apply speech recognition system is summarized. The procedure is illustrated, to implement a speech based electrical switch in home automation for the Indonesian language. The main key of the procedure is to match the environment for training and testing using the training data recorded from the testing program, HVite. Often the silence detector of HTK is wrongly triggered by noises because the microphone is too sensitive. This problem is mitigated by simply scaling down the volume. In this sub-word phone-based speech recognition, noise is included in the training database and labelled particularly. Illustration of the procedure is applied to a home automation application. Electrical switches are controlled by Indonesian speech recognizer. The results show 100% command completion rate.
