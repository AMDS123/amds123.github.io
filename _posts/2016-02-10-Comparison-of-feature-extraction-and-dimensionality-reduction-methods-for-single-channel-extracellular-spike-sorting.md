##### Abstract
Spikes in the membrane electrical potentials of neurons play a major role in the functioning of nervous systems of animals. Obtaining the spikes from different neurons has been a challenging problem for decades. Several schemes have been proposed for spike sorting to isolate the spikes of individual neurons from electrical recordings in extracellular media. However, there is much scope for improvement in the accuracies obtained using the prevailing methods of spike sorting. To determine more effective spike sorting strategies using well known methods, we compared different types of signal features and techniques for dimensionality reduction in feature space. We tried to determine an optimum or near optimum feature extraction and dimensionality reduction methods and an optimum or near optimum number of features for spike sorting. We assessed relative performance of well known methods on simulated recordings specially designed for development and benchmarking of spike sorting schemes, with varying number of spike classes and the well established method of $k$-means clustering of selected features. We found that almost all well known methods performed quite well. Nevertheless, from spike waveforms of 64 samples, sampled at 24 kHz, using principal component analysis (PCA) to select around 46 to 55 features led to the better spike sorting performance than most other methods (Wilcoxon signed rank sum test, $p < 0.001$).

神经元膜电位的峰值在动物神经系统的功能中起主要作用。几十年来，从不同神经元获得尖峰一直是一个具有挑战性的问题。已经提出了几种用于穗分选的方案，以将单个神经元的刺激与细胞外介质中的电记录隔离。然而，使用普遍的穗分选方法获得的精度有很大的改进空间。为了使用众所周知的方法确定更有效的尖峰排序策略，我们比较了不同类型的信号特征和降维特征空间技术。我们试图确定最佳或接近最佳的特征提取和降维方法，以及针对穗分选的最佳或接近最佳数目的特征。我们评估了众所周知的模拟记录的相对性能，这些模拟记录是专门为尖峰分选方案的开发和基准设计的，具有不同数量的尖峰类别以及已确定的$ k $ -means聚类所选特征的方法。我们发现几乎所有的知名方法都表现的很好。尽管如此，从64个样本的尖峰波形中，采样频率为24 kHz，使用主成分分析（PCA）选择46到55个特征，导致更好的穗分选性能比大多数其他方法更好（Wilcoxon符号秩和检验，$ p <0.001 $）。
