##### Abstract
In this paper a new strategy based on disturbance and uncertainty (DU) estimation and attenuation technique is proposed and tested on the nonlinear kinematic model of the differential drive mobile robot (DDMR). The proposed technique is an improved version of the Active Disturbance Rejection Control (ADRC) strategy suggested by J. Han. The ADRC is used to actively reject disturbances caused by the unknown exogenous signals and the matched uncertainties of the system model, which are lumped all together and attributed as a total disturbance. In this work, the considered system is assumed to be affine and the total disturbance and the input are considered to be on different channels. To deal with the mismatched disturbances and uncertainties, the total disturbance has been converted into a matched one. Then, based on the improved ADRC (IADRC), the dynamic performance of the DDMR has been enhanced by estimating the total disturbance and canceling it from the system. Through digital simulations, different performance measures are applied, and they all indicate the effectiveness of the proposed IADRC by almost removing the chattering phenomenon and providing a high immunity in the closed-loop system against torque disturbance.

本文提出了一种基于干扰和不确定性（DU）估计和衰减技术的新策略，并对差分驱动移动机器人（DDMR）的非线性运动学模型进行了测试。所提出的技术是J. Han提出的改进版本的主动干扰抑制控制（ADRC）策略。 ADRC用于主动拒绝由未知外部信号引起的干扰和系统模型的匹配不确定性，这些不确定性集中在一起并归因于总干扰。在这项工作中，所考虑的系统被假定为仿射，并且总扰动和输入被认为是在不同的通道上。为了处理不匹配的干扰和不确定性，总干扰已被转换为匹配干扰。然后，基于改进的ADRC（IADRC），通过估计总干扰并将其从系统中消除，可以提高DDMR的动态性能。通过数字仿真，应用了不同的性能测量方法，它们都通过几乎消除抖动现象并在闭环系统中提供了抗转矩干扰的高抗扰度来指示所提议的IADRC的有效性。
