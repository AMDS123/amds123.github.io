##### Abstract
EF Eri is a magnetic cataclysmic variable that has been in a low accretion state for the past nine years. Low state optical spectra reveal the underlying Zeeman-split white dwarf absorption lines. These features are used to determine a value of 13-14 MG as the white dwarf field strength. Recently, 5-7 years into the low state, Balmer and other emission lines have appeared in the optical. An analysis of the H$\alpha$ emission line yields the first radial velocity solution for EF Eri, leading to a spectroscopic ephemeris for the binary and, using the best available white dwarf mass of 0.6M${\odot}$, a mass estimate for the secondary of 0.055M${\odot}$. For a white dwarf mass of 0.95M${\odot}$, the average for magnetic white dwarfs, the secondary mass increases to 0.087M${\odot}$. At EF Eri's orbital period of 81 minutes, this higher mass secondary could not be a normal star and still fit within the Roche lobe. The source of the Balmer and other emission lines is confirmed to be from the sub-stellar secondary and we argue that it is due to stellar activity. We compare EF Eri's emission line spectrum and activity behavior to that recently observed in AM Her and VV Pup and attributed to stellar activity. We explore observations and models originally developed for V471 Tau, for the RS CVn binaries, and for extra-solar planets. We conclude that irradiation of the secondary in EF Eri and similar systems is unlikely and, in polars, the magnetic field interaction between the two stars (with a possible tidal component) is a probable mechanism which would concentrate chromospheric activity on the secondary near the sub-stellar point of the white dwarf.

EF Eri是一个磁性灾难性变量，在过去九年中一直处于低增长状态。低态光谱揭示了底层的塞曼分裂白矮星吸收谱线。这些特征被用来确定13-14MG的值作为白矮星场强度。最近5  -  7年进入低谷状态，巴尔默等排放线已经出现在光学领域。通过对H $ \ alpha $发射线的分析，得出了EF Eri的第一个径向速度解，导出了二进制的光谱星历表，并且使用最好的可用的白矮星质量为0.6M的质量，估计为0.055M $ {\ odot} $。对于磁白矮星的平均质量为0.95M的白矮星质量，次级质量增加到0.087Mδ。在EF Eri的81分钟的轨道周期内，这个更高的质量中等不能成为正常的恒星，仍然适合于罗氏叶片。 Balmer和其他发射线的来源被证实来自亚恒星次级，我们认为这是由于恒星的活动。我们比较EF Eri的发射线谱和活动行为，最近在AM Her和VV Pup中观察到的并归因于恒星活动。我们探索最初为V471 Tau，RS CVn二进制和太阳系行星所开发的观测和模型。我们得出这样的结论：EF Eri和类似系统中的次级辐射是不太可能的，并且在极地，两个恒星（具有可能的潮汐分量）之间的磁场相互作用是将色球活动集中在次级附近的可能机制白矮星的星座点。
