##### Abstract
This paper focuses on the joint multi-object tracking (MOT) and the estimate of detection probability with Poisson multi-Bernoulli mixture (PMBM) filter. In a majority of multi-object scenarios, the knowledge of detection probability is usually uncertain, which is often estimated offline from the training data. In such cases, online filtering is not allowed, otherwise, significate parameter mismatch will result in biased estimates. Hence, the ability of adaptively estimating the detection probability is essential in practice. In this paper, we detail how the detection probability can be estimated accompanied with the state estimates.Besides, closed-form solutions to the proposed method are derived by approximating the intensity of Poisson RFS to a Beta-Gaussian mixtures form and density of Bernoulli RFS to a single Beta Gaussian form. Simulation results show the effectiveness of the proposed method.
