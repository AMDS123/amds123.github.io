##### Abstract
This paper reports the results of an experiment on the use of Kak's B-Matrix approach to spreading activity in a Hebbian neural network. Specifically, it concentrates on the memory retrieval from single neurons and compares the performance of the B-Matrix approach to that of the traditional approach.
