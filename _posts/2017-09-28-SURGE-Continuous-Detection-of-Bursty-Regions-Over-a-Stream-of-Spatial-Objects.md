##### Abstract
With the proliferation of mobile devices and location-based services, continuous generation of massive volume of streaming spatial objects (i.e., geo-tagged data) opens up new opportunities to address real-world problems by analyzing them. In this paper, we present a novel continuous bursty region detection problem that aims to continuously detect a bursty region of a given size in a specified geographical area from a stream of spatial objects. Specifically, a bursty region shows maximum spike in the number of spatial objects in a given time window. The problem is useful in addressing several real-world challenges such as surge pricing problem in online transportation and disease outbreak detection. To solve the problem, we propose an exact solution and two approximate solutions, and the approximation ratio is $\frac{1-\alpha}{4}$ in terms of the burst score, where $\alpha$ is a parameter to control the burst score. We further extend these solutions to support detection of top-$k$ bursty regions. Extensive experiments with real-world data are conducted to demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of our solutions.

随着移动设备和基于位置的服务的激增，大量流式空间对象（即地理标记数据）的连续生成为通过分析现实世界问题提供了新的机会。在本文中，我们提出了一种新颖的连续突发区域检测问题，旨在从空间对象流中连续检测特定地理区域中给定大小的突发区域。具体而言，突发区域在给定的时间窗口中显示空间对象的数量的最大峰值。这个问题对于解决一些现实世界的挑战是有用的，例如在线运输中的激增价格问题以及疾病爆发检测。为了解决这个问题，我们提出了一个精确解和两个近似解，并且根据突发分数的近似比是$ \ frac {1 \ alpha} {4} $，其中$ \ alpha $是一个控制参数爆裂分数。我们进一步扩展这些解决方案，以支持检测顶部$ k $突发区域。为了证明我们解决方案的效率和有效性，我们进行了大量的实际数据实验。
