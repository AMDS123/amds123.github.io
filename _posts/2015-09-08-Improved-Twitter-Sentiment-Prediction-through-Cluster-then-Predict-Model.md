##### Abstract
Over the past decade humans have experienced exponential growth in the use of online resources, in particular social media and microblogging websites such as Facebook, Twitter, YouTube and also mobile applications such as WhatsApp, Line, etc. Many companies have identified these resources as a rich mine of marketing knowledge. This knowledge provides valuable feedback which allows them to further develop the next generation of their product. In this paper, sentiment analysis of a product is performed by extracting tweets about that product and classifying the tweets showing it as positive and negative sentiment. The authors propose a hybrid approach which combines unsupervised learning in the form of K-means clustering to cluster the tweets and then performing supervised learning methods such as Decision Trees and Support Vector Machines for classification.

在过去的十年中，人们在使用在线资源方面经历了指数增长，特别是Facebook，Twitter，YouTube等社交媒体和微博网站以及诸如WhatsApp，Line等移动应用程序。许多公司已经将这些资源标识为丰富的营销知识。这些知识提供了宝贵的反馈，使他们能够进一步开发下一代产品。在本文中，对产品的情感分析是通过提取关于该产品的推文进行的，并将推特分类为正面和负面的情绪。作者提出了一种混合方法，将K-means聚类形式的无监督学习结合起来，对推文进行聚类，然后执行监督学习方法，如决策树和支持向量机进行分类。
