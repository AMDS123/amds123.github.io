##### Abstract
We propose an 'end-to-end' character-based recurrent neural network that extracts disease named entities from a Japanese medical text and simultaneously judges its modality as either positive or negative; i.e., the mentioned disease or symptom is affirmed or negated. The motivation to adopt neural networks is to learn effective lexical and structural representation features for Entity Recognition and also for Positive/Negative classification from an annotated corpora without explicitly providing any rule-based or manual feature sets. We confirmed the superiority of our method over previous char-based CRF or SVM methods in the results.

##### Abstract (translated by Google)
我们提出了一种'端对端'的基于字符的循环神经网络，它从日本医学文本中提取疾病命名实体，并同时判断其形式为正面或负面;即所提及的疾病或症状是肯定的或否定的。采用神经网络的动机是为实体识别学习有效的词汇和结构表征特征，并从注释的语料库中学习正/负分类，而不明确提供任何基于规则或手动的特征集。我们证实了我们的方法优于先前的基于char的CRF或SVM方法在结果中的优势。
