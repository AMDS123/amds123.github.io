##### Abstract
Texture is an important characteristic for many types of images. In recent years very discriminative and computationally efficient local texture descriptors based on local binary patterns (LBP) have been developed, which has led to significant progress in applying texture methods to different problems and applications. Due to this progress, the division between texture descriptors and more generic image or video descriptors has been disappearing. A large number of different variants of LBP have been developed to improve its robustness, and to increase its discriminative power and applicability to different types of problems. In this chapter, the most recent and important variants of LBP in 2D, spatiotemporal, 3D, and 4D domains are surveyed. Interesting new developments of LBP in 1D signal analysis are also considered. Finally, some future challenges for research are presented.

##### Abstract (translated by Google)
纹理是许多类型图像的重要特征。近年来，基于局部二值模式（LBP）的局部纹理描述符的鉴别和高效计算已经得到了发展，这导致了纹理方法在不同问题和应用中的应用。由于这一进展，纹理描述符和更一般的图像或视频描述符之间的划分已经消失。已经开发了大量不同的LBP变体来提高其鲁棒性，并增加其对于不同类型问题的判别力和适用性。在本章中，调查了二维，时空，三维和四维域中LBP的最新和重要的变体。 LBP在一维信号分析中的有趣的新发展也被考虑。最后，介绍一些未来的研究挑战。
