##### Abstract
The nitride semiconductor materials GaN, AlN, and InN, and their alloys and heterostructures have been investigated extensively in the last 3 decades, leading to several technologically successful photonic and electronic devices. Just over the past few years, a number of new nitride materials have emerged with exciting photonic, electronic, and magnetic properties. Some examples are 2D and layered hBN and the III-V diamond analog cBN, the transition metal nitrides ScN, YN, and their alloys (e.g. ferroelectric ScAlN), piezomagnetic GaMnN, ferrimagnetic Mn4N, and epitaxial superconductor/semiconductor NbN/GaN heterojunctions. This article reviews the fascinating and emerging physics and science of these new nitride materials. It also discusses their potential applications in future generations of devices that take advantage of the photonic and electronic devices eco-system based on transistors, light-emitting diodes, and lasers that have already been created by the nitride semiconductors.
