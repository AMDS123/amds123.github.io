##### Abstract
With the rapid proliferation of Internet of Things and intelligent edge devices, there is an increasing need for implementing machine learning algorithms, including deep learning, on resource-constrained mobile embedded devices with limited memory and computation power. Typical large Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) need large amounts of memory and computational power, and cannot be deployed on embedded devices efficiently. We present Two-Bit Networks (TBNs) for model compression of CNNs with edge weights constrained to (-2, -1, 1, 2), which can be encoded with two bits. Our approach can reduce the memory usage and improve computational efficiency significantly while achieving good performance in terms of classification accuracy, thus representing a reasonable tradeoff between model size and performance.

随着物联网和智能边缘设备的快速普及，对于资源受限的移动嵌入式设备（内存和计算能力有限）实施机器学习算法（包括深度学习）的需求日益增加。典型的大型卷积神经网络（CNNs）需要大量的存储器和计算能力，不能有效地部署在嵌入式设备上。我们提出两位网络（TBNs）用于边缘权重约束为（-2，-1,1,2）的可以用两位编码的CNN的模型压缩。我们的方法可以显着减少内存使用量，提高计算效率，同时在分类精度方面取得良好的表现，从而在模型尺寸和性能之间进行合理的折衷。
