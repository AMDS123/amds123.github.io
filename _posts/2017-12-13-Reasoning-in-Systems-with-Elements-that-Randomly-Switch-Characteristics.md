##### Abstract
We examine the issue of stability of probability in reasoning about complex systems with uncertainty in structure. Normally, propositions are viewed as probability functions on an abstract random graph where it is implicitly assumed that the nodes of the graph have stable properties. But what if some of the nodes change their characteristics? This is a situation that cannot be covered by abstractions of either static or dynamic sets when these changes take place at regular intervals. We propose the use of sets with elements that change, and modular forms are proposed to account for one type of such change. An expression for the dependence of the mean on the probability of the switching elements has been determined. The system is also analyzed from the perspective of decision between different hypotheses. Such sets are likely to be of use in complex system queries and in analysis of surveys.

##### Abstract (translated by Google)
我们考察了结构不确定性复杂系统推理过程中概率稳定性的问题。通常，命题被视为抽象随机图上的概率函数，其隐含地假定图的节点具有稳定的性质。但是如果一些节点改变了它们的特性呢？当这些变化定期发生时，这种情况不能被静态或动态集合的抽象所覆盖。我们建议使用具有变化元素的集合，并且提出模块化形式来说明这种变化的一种类型。已经确定了平均值对开关元件的概率的依赖性的表达式。从不同假设之间的决策角度对系统进行了分析。这些集合很可能用于复杂的系统查询和调查分析。
