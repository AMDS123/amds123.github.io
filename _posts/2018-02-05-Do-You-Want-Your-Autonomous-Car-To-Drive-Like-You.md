##### Abstract
With progress in enabling autonomous cars to drive safely on the road, it is time to start asking how they should be driving. A common answer is that they should be adopting their users' driving style. This makes the assumption that users want their autonomous cars to drive like they drive - aggressive drivers want aggressive cars, defensive drivers want defensive cars. In this paper, we put that assumption to the test. We find that users tend to prefer a significantly more defensive driving style than their own. Interestingly, they prefer the style they think is their own, even though their actual driving style tends to be more aggressive. We also find that preferences do depend on the specific driving scenario, opening the door for new ways of learning driving style preference.

随着自动驾驶汽车在道路上安全行驶的进展，现在是时候开始询问他们应该如何驾驶。一个普遍的答案是他们应该采用用户的驾驶风格。这使得用户希望他们的自动驾驶汽车能像他们驾驶一样驾驶 - 积极的驾驶员需要侵略性的汽车，防御性的驾驶员需要防御性的汽车。在本文中，我们把这个假设用于测试。我们发现用户倾向于比自己更喜欢防御性更强的驾驶风格。有趣的是，他们更喜欢他们认为是自己的风格，尽管他们的实际驾驶风格往往更具侵略性。我们也发现，喜好取决于具体的驾驶情景，为学习驾驶风格偏好的新途径打开了大门。
