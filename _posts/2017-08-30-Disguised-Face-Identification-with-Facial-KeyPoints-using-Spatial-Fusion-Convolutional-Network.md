##### Abstract
Disguised face identification (DFI) is an extremely challenging problem due to the numerous variations that can be introduced using different disguises. This paper introduces a deep learning framework to first detect 14 facial key-points which are then utilized to perform disguised face identification. Since the training of deep learning architectures relies on large annotated datasets, two annotated facial key-points datasets are introduced. The effectiveness of the facial keypoint detection framework is presented for each keypoint. The superiority of the key-point detection framework is also demonstrated by a comparison with other deep networks. The effectiveness of classification performance is also demonstrated by comparison with the state-of-the-art face disguise classification methods.

伪装面部识别（DFI）是一个非常具有挑战性的问题，因为可以使用不同的伪装引入许多变化。本文引入了一个深度学习框架，首先检测出14个面部关键点，然后利用这些关键点进行伪装面部识别。由于深度学习架构的训练依赖于大型的注释数据集，所以引入了两个带注释的面部关键点数据集。为每个关键点提供面部关键点检测框架的有效性。通过与其他深度网络的比较，也证明了关键点检测框架的优越性。分类性能的有效性也通过与最先进的面部伪装分类方法进行比较来证明。
