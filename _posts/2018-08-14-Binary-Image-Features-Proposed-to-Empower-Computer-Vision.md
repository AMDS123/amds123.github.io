##### Abstract
This literature has proposed three fast and easy computable image features to improve computer vision by offering more human-like vision power. These features are not based on image pixels absolute or relative intensity; neither based on shape or colour. So, no complex pixel by pixel calculation is required. For human eyes, pixel by pixel calculation is like seeing an image with maximum zoom which is done only when a higher level of details is required. Normally, first we look at an image to get an overall idea about it to know whether it deserves further investigation or not. This capacity of getting an idea at a glance is analysed and three basic features are proposed to empower computer vision. Potential of proposed features is tested and established through different medical dataset. Achieved accuracy in classification demonstrates possibilities and potential of the use of the proposed features in image processing.

该文献提出了三种快速简便的可计算图像特征，通过提供更像人类的视觉能力来改善计算机视觉。这些特征不是基于图像像素的绝对或相对强度;既不是基于形状或颜色。因此，不需要复杂的逐像素计算。对于人眼来说，逐像素计算就像看到具有最大变焦的图像，这仅在需要更高级别的细节时才进行。通常情况下，首先我们会查看图像，以了解它是否值得进一步调查。分析了这种获得想法的能力，并提出了三个基本特征来增强计算机视觉。通过不同的医学数据集测试和建立所提出的特征的潜力。实现分类的准确性证明了在图像处理中使用所提出的特征的可能性和潜力。
