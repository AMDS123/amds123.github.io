##### Abstract
Self-paced learning (SPL) mimics the cognitive mechanism of humans and animals that gradually learns from easy to hard samples. One key issue in SPL is to obtain better weighting strategy that is determined by minimizer function. Existing methods usually pursue this by artificially designing the explicit form of SPL regularizer. In this paper, we focus on the minimizer function, and study a group of new regularizer, named self-paced implicit regularizer that is deduced from robust loss function. Based on the convex conjugacy theory, the minimizer function for self-paced implicit regularizer can be directly learned from the latent loss function, while the analytic form of the regularizer can be even known. A general framework (named SPL-IR) for SPL is developed accordingly. We demonstrate that the learning procedure of SPL-IR is associated with latent robust loss functions, thus can provide some theoretical inspirations for its working mechanism. We further analyze the relation between SPL-IR and half-quadratic optimization. Finally, we implement SPL-IR to both supervised and unsupervised tasks, and experimental results corroborate our ideas and demonstrate the correctness and effectiveness of implicit regularizers.

##### Abstract (translated by Google)
自主学习（SPL）模仿人类和动物的认知机制，逐渐从易到难的样本学习。 SPL中的一个关键问题是获得由最小化函数决定的更好的权重策略。现有的方法通常通过人为地设计SPL调节器的显式形式来实现。在本文中，我们重点研究最小化函数，并研究一组新的正则化函数，称为自适应隐式正则化函数，由稳健损失函数推导出来。基于凸共轭理论，自调节隐式调节器的最小化函数可以直接从潜在损失函数中学习，而调和器的分析形式甚至可以是已知的。针对SPL的通用框架（称为SPL-IR）被相应地开发。我们证明SPL-IR的学习过程与潜在的鲁棒损失函数相关，从而为其工作机制提供一些理论启示。我们进一步分析了SPL-IR与半二次优化之间的关系。最后，我们将SPL-IR用于监督和非监督任务，实验结果证实了我们的观点，并证明了隐式调节器的正确性和有效性。
