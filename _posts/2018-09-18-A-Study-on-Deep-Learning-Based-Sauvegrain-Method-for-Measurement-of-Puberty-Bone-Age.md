##### Abstract
This study applies a technique to expand the number of images to a level that allows deep learning. And the applicability of the Sauvegrain method through deep learning with relatively few elbow X-rays is studied. The study was composed of processes similar to the physicians' bone age assessment procedures. The selected reference images were learned without being included in the evaluation data, and at the same time, the data was extended to accommodate the number of cases. In addition, we adjusted the X-ray images to better images using U-Net and selected the ROI with RPN + so as to be able to perform bone age estimation through CNN. The mean absolute error of the Sauvegrain method based on deep learning is 2.8 months and the Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) is 0.018. This result shows that X - ray analysis using the Sauvegrain method shows higher accuracy than that of the age group of puberty even in the deep learning base. This means that deep learning of the Suvegrain method can be measured at a level similar to that of an expert, based on the extended X-ray image with the image data extension technique. Finally, we applied the Sauvegrain method to deep learning for accurate measurement of bone age at puberty. As a result, the present study is based on deep learning, and compared with the evaluation results of experts, it is possible to overcome limitations of the method of measuring bone age based on machine learning which was in TW3 or Greulich &amp; Pyle due to lack of X- I confirmed the fact. And we also presented the Sauvegrain method, which is applicable to adolescents as well.

本研究采用一种技术将图像数量扩展到允许深度学习的水平。并且研究了Sauvegrain方法通过深度学习和相对较少的肘部X射线的适用性。该研究由与医生的骨龄评估程序类似的过程组成。在不包括在评估数据中的情况下学习所选择的参考图像，同时，扩展数据以适应病例数。此外，我们使用U-Net将X射线图像调整为更好的图像，并选择具有RPN +的ROI，以便能够通过CNN执行骨龄估计。基于深度学习的Sauvegrain方法的平均绝对误差为2.8个月，平均绝对百分比误差（MAPE）为0.018。该结果表明，即使在深度学习基础上，使用Sauvegrain方法的X射线分析显示出比青春期年龄组更高的准确性。这意味着基于具有图像数据扩展技术的扩展X射线图像，可以在与专家类似的水平上测量Suvegrain方法的深度学习。最后，我们将Sauvegrain方法应用于深度学习，以准确测量青春期的骨龄。因此，本研究基于深度学习，并且与专家的评估结果相比，可以克服基于机器学习的测量骨龄的方法的局限性，该机器学习在TW3或Greulich＆amp; Pyle由于缺乏X-I证实了这一事实。我们还介绍了适用于青少年的Sauvegrain方法。
