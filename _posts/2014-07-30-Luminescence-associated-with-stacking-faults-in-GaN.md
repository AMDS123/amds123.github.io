##### Abstract
Basal-plane stacking faults are an important class of optically active structural defects in wurtzite semiconductors. The local deviation from the 2H stacking of the wurtzite matrix to a 3C zinc-blende stacking induces a bound state in the gap of the host crystal, resulting in the localization of excitons. Due to the two-dimensional nature of these planar defects, stacking faults act as quantum wells, giving rise to radiative transitions of excitons with characteristic energies. Luminescence spectroscopy is thus capable of detecting even a single stacking fault in an otherwise perfect wurtzite crystal. This review draws a comprehensive picture of the luminescence properties related to stacking faults in GaN. The emission energies associated with different types of stacking faults as well as factors that can shift these energies are discussed. In this context, the importance of the quantum-confined Stark effect in these zinc-blende/wurtzite heterostructures, which results from the spontaneous polarization of wurtzite GaN, is underlined. This discussion is extended to zinc-blende segments in a wurtzite matrix. Furthermore, other factors affecting the emission energy and linewidth of stacking fault-related peaks as well as results obtained at room temperature are addressed. The considerations presented in this article should be transferable also to other wurtzite semiconductors.
