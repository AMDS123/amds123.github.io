##### Abstract
The work presented in this paper attempts to evaluate and quantify the use of discourse relations in the context of blog summarization and compare their use to more traditional and factual texts. Specifically, we measured the usefulness of 6 discourse relations - namely comparison, contingency, illustration, attribution, topic-opinion, and attributive for the task of text summarization from blogs. We have evaluated the effect of each relation using the TAC 2008 opinion summarization dataset and compared them with the results with the DUC 2007 dataset. The results show that in both textual genres, contingency, comparison, and illustration relations provide a significant improvement on summarization content; while attribution, topic-opinion, and attributive relations do not provide a consistent and significant improvement. These results indicate that, at least for summarization, discourse relations are just as useful for informal and affective texts as for more traditional news articles.

本文提出的工作试图评估和量化在博客文摘中语篇关系的使用，并将其用于比较传统和事实的文本。具体而言，我们测量了博客文本摘要任务的6种语篇关系的有用性，即比较，意外，插图，归因，主题 - 意见和归因。我们已经使用TAC 2008意见摘要数据集评估了每个关系的影响，并将其与DUC 2007数据集的结果进行了比较。结果表明，在文本体裁中，意外事件，比较和说明关系对总结内容有显着的改善;而归因，主题 - 意见和归属关系则不能提供一致的和显着的改进。这些结果表明，至少对于总结来说，话语关系对于非正式和情感的文本和对更传统的新闻文章来说同样有用。
