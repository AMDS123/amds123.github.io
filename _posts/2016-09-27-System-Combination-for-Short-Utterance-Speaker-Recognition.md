##### Abstract
For text-independent short-utterance speaker recognition (SUSR), the performance often degrades dramatically. This paper presents a combination approach to the SUSR tasks with two phonetic-aware systems: one is the DNN-based i-vector system and the other is our recently proposed subregion-based GMM-UBM system. The former employs phone posteriors to construct an i-vector model in which the shared statistics offers stronger robustness against limited test data, while the latter establishes a phone-dependent GMM-UBM system which represents speaker characteristics with more details. A score-level fusion is implemented to integrate the respective advantages from the two systems. Experimental results show that for the text-independent SUSR task, both the DNN-based i-vector system and the subregion-based GMM-UBM system outperform their respective baselines, and the score-level system combination delivers performance improvement.

对于与文本无关的短语说话人识别（SUSR），性能通常会急剧下降。本文提出了两种语音感知系统的SUSR任务的组合方法：一种是基于DNN的i矢量系统，另一种是我们最近提出的基于子区域的GMM-UBM系统。前者采用电话后台构建i-vector模型，共享统计数据对有限的测试数据提供了更强的鲁棒性，而后者建立了一个与话音相关的GMM-UBM系统，其中包含更多细节。实现分数级融合以整合两个系统各自的优点。实验结果表明，对于与文本无关的SUSR任务，基于DNN的i-矢量系统和基于子区域的GMM-UBM系统均优于各自的基线，得分级别的系统组合提高了性能。
