##### Abstract
Object search -- the problem of finding a target object in a cluttered scene -- is essential to solve for many robotics applications in warehouse and household environments. However, cluttered environments entail that objects often occlude one another, making it difficult to segment objects and infer their shapes and properties. Instead of relying on the availability of CAD or other explicit models of scene objects, we augment a manipulation planner for cluttered environments with a state-of-the-art deep neural network for shape completion as well as a volumetric memory system, allowing the robot to reason about what may be contained in occluded areas. We test the system in a variety of tabletop manipulation scenes composed of household items, highlighting its applicability to realistic domains. Our results suggest that incorporating both components into a manipulation planning framework significantly reduces the number of actions needed to find a hidden object in dense clutter.
