##### Abstract
This manuscript addresses the problem of the automatic lesion boundary detection in dermoscopy, using deep neural networks. An approach is based on the adaptation of the U-net convolutional neural network with skip connections for lesion boundary segmentation task. I hope this paper could serve, to some extent, as an experiment of using deep convolutional networks in biomedical segmentation task and as a guideline of the boundary detection benchmark, inspiring further attempts and researches.
