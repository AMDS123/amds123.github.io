##### Abstract
Flies that walk in a covered planar arena on straight paths avoid colliding with each other, but which of the two flies stops is not random. High-throughput video observations, coupled with dedicated experiments with controlled robot flies have revealed that flies utilize the type of optic flow on their retina as a determinant of who should stop, a strategy also used by ship captains to determine which of two ships on a collision course should throw engines in reverse. We use digital evolution to test whether this strategy evolves when collision avoidance is the sole penalty. We find that the strategy does indeed evolve in a narrow range of cost/benefit ratios, for experiments in which the "regressive motion" cue is error free. We speculate that these stringent conditions may not be sufficient to evolve the strategy in real flies, pointing perhaps to auxiliary costs and benefits not modeled in our study

##### Abstract (translated by Google)
苍蝇在直线路径上的有盖平面竞技场中行走，避免相互碰撞，但是两只苍蝇中的哪一只不是随机的。高吞吐量的视频观察，再加上控制机器人苍蝇的专门实验，已经揭示了苍蝇利用视网膜上的光流的类型作为谁应该停止的决定因素，船长们也使用一种策略来确定两艘船上的哪一艘碰撞过程应该使发动机倒转。我们使用数字进化来测试这个策略是否在避免碰撞是唯一的惩罚时发展。我们发现这个策略确实在狭窄的成本/收益比范围内演变，对于“回归运动”提示没有错误的实验。我们推测，这些严格的条件可能不足以推动真正的苍蝇战略，也许指向没有在我们的研究中模仿的辅助成本和收益
