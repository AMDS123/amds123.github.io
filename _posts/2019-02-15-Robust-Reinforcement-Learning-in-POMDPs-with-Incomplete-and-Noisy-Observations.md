##### Abstract
In real-world scenarios, the observation data for reinforcement learning with continuous control is commonly noisy and part of it may be dynamically missing over time, which violates the assumption of many current methods developed for this. We addressed the issue within the framework of partially observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP) using a model-based method, in which the transition model is estimated from the incomplete and noisy observations using a newly proposed surrogate loss function with local approximation, while the policy and value function is learned with the help of belief imputation. For the latter purpose, a generative model is constructed and is seamlessly incorporated into the belief updating procedure of POMDP, which enables robust execution even under a significant incompleteness and noise. The effectiveness of the proposed method is verified on a collection of benchmark tasks, showing that our approach outperforms several compared methods under various challenging scenarios.
