##### Abstract
We use Bayesian optimization to learn curricula for word representation learning, optimizing performance on downstream tasks that depend on the learned representations as features. The curricula are modeled by a linear ranking function which is the scalar product of a learned weight vector and an engineered feature vector that characterizes the different aspects of the complexity of each instance in the training corpus. We show that learning the curriculum improves performance on a variety of downstream tasks over random orders and in comparison to the natural corpus order.

我们使用贝叶斯优化来学习单词表示学习的课程，优化依赖于学习表示作为特征的下游任务的性能。课程由线性排序函数建模，该函数是学习权重向量和工程特征向量的标量积，表征训练语料库中每个实例的复杂性的不同方面。我们表明，学习课程提高了随机顺序上的各种下游任务的性能，并与自然语料库顺序进行比较。
