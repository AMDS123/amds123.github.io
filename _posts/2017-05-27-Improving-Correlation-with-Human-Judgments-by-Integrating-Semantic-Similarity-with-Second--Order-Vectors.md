##### Abstract
Vector space methods that measure semantic similarity and relatedness often rely on distributional information such as co--occurrence frequencies or statistical measures of association to weight the importance of particular co--occurrences. In this paper, we extend these methods by incorporating a measure of semantic similarity based on a human curated taxonomy into a second--order vector representation. This results in a measure of semantic relatedness that combines both the contextual information available in a corpus--based vector space representation with the semantic knowledge found in a biomedical ontology. Our results show that incorporating semantic similarity into a second order co--occurrence matrices improves correlation with human judgments for both similarity and relatedness, and that our method compares favorably to various different word embedding methods that have recently been evaluated on the same reference standards we have used.

测量语义相似性和相关性的矢量空间方法往往依赖于分布信息，如同现频率或统计关联度量来衡量特定共现的重要性。在本文中，我们扩展这些方法，将基于人类策划的分类的语义相似度量度结合到二阶向量表示中。这导致了语义相关性的度量，其将基于语料库的向量空间表示中可用的语境信息与生物医学本体中发现的语义知识相结合。我们的研究结果表明，将语义相似度纳入二阶共现矩阵可以提高与相似性和相关性的人类判断的相关性，并且我们的方法与最近在相同参考标准上评估过的各种不同的单词嵌入方法用过的。
