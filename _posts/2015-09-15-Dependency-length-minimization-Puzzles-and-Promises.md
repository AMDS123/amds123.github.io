##### Abstract
In the recent issue of PNAS, Futrell et al. claims that their study of 37 languages gives the first large scale cross-language evidence for Dependency Length Minimization, which is an overstatement that ignores similar previous researches. In addition,this study seems to pay no attention to factors like the uniformity of genres,which weakens the validity of the argument that DLM is universal. Another problem is that this study sets the baseline random language as projective, which fails to truly uncover the difference between natural language and random language, since projectivity is an important feature of many natural languages. Finally, the paper contends an "apparent relationship between head finality and dependency length" despite the lack of an explicit statistical comparison, which renders this conclusion rather hasty and improper.

##### Abstract (translated by Google)
在最近的PNAS期刊中，Futrell等人声称他们对37种语言的研究给出了依赖长度最小化的第一个大规模的跨语言证据，这是多余的，忽略了以前的类似研究。此外，本研究似乎并不关注类型统一等因素，这削弱了DLM普遍性的论证的有效性。另一个问题是，本研究将基线随机语言设定为投影，这并不能真正揭示自然语言与随机语言之间的差异，因为预测性是许多自然语言的重要特征。最后，本文认为，尽管缺乏明确的统计比较，“头部终结性和依赖性长度之间的明显关系”使得这个结论相当仓促和不恰当。
