##### Abstract
Soft robots offer an alternative approach to manipulate inside the constrained space while maintaining the safe interaction with the external environment. Due to its adaptable compliance characteristic, external contact force can easily deform the robot shapes and lead to undesired robot kinematic and dynamic properties. Accurate contact detection and contact position estimation are of critical importance for soft robot modeling, control, trajectory planning, and eventually affect the success of task completion. In this paper, we focus on the study of 1-DoF soft pneumatic bellow bending actuator, which is one of the fundamental components to construct complex, multi-DoF soft robots. This 1-DoF soft robot is modeled through the integral representation of the spacial curve. The direct and instantaneous kinematics are calculated explicitly through a modal method. The fixed centrode deviation (FCD) method is used to to detect the external contact and estimate contact location. Simulation results indicate that the contact location can be accurately estimated by solving a nonlinear least square optimization problem.
