##### Abstract
Digital libraries store images which can be highly degraded and to index this kind of images we resort to word spot- ting as our information retrieval system. Information retrieval for handwritten document images is more challenging due to the difficulties in complex layout analysis, large variations of writing styles, and degradation or low quality of historical manuscripts. This paper presents a simple innovative learning-free method for word spotting from large scale historical documents combining Local Binary Pattern (LBP) and spatial sampling. This method offers three advantages: firstly, it operates in completely learning free paradigm which is very different from unsupervised learning methods, secondly, the computational time is significantly low because of the LBP features which are very fast to compute, and thirdly, the method can be used in scenarios where annotations are not available. Finally we compare the results of our proposed retrieval method with the other methods in the literature.

数字图书馆存储的图像可以被高度降级，并且将这种图像索引为我们的信息检索系统。手写文档图像的信息检索由于复杂的版面分析困难，书写风格的变化大，以及历史手稿的质量下降或劣质等原因而更具挑战性。本文提出了一种结合局部二值模式（LBP）和空间采样的大规模历史文档的单词识别的简单创新学习方法。这种方法提供了三个优点：第一，它完全学习了与无监督学习方法完全不同的自由范式;第二，由于计算速度非常快的LBP特征，计算时间明显减少;第三，用于注释不可用的场景。最后我们比较我们提出的检索方法的结果与文献中的其他方法。
