##### Abstract
Memories in neural system are shaped through the interplay of neural and learning dynamics under external inputs. By introducing a simple local learning rule to a neural network, we found that the memory capacity is drastically increased by sequentially repeating the learning steps of input-output mappings. The origin of this enhancement is attributed to the generation of a Psuedo-inverse correlation in the connectivity. This is associated with the emergence of spontaneous activity that intermittently exhibits neural patterns corresponding to embedded memories. Stablization of memories is achieved by a distinct bifurcation from the spontaneous activity under the application of each input.
