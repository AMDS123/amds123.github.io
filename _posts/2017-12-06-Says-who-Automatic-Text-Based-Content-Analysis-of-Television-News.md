##### Abstract
We perform an automatic analysis of television news programs, based on the closed captions that accompany them. Specifically, we collect all the news broadcasted in over 140 television channels in the US during a period of six months. We start by segmenting, processing, and annotating the closed captions automatically. Next, we focus on the analysis of their linguistic style and on mentions of people using NLP methods. We present a series of key insights about news providers, people in the news, and we discuss the biases that can be uncovered by automatic means. These insights are contrasted by looking at the data from multiple points of view, including qualitative assessment.

我们根据电视新闻节目的自动分析功能进行自动分析。具体来说，我们收集了在六个月内在美国140多个电视频道播出的所有新闻。我们从分割，处理和自动注释隐藏字幕开始。接下来，我们着重分析他们的语言风格，并提及使用NLP方法的人。我们提供了一系列关于新闻提供者，新闻人物的关键见解，并讨论了可以通过自动方式发现的偏见。通过从多个角度观察数据，包括定性评估，对比这些见解。
