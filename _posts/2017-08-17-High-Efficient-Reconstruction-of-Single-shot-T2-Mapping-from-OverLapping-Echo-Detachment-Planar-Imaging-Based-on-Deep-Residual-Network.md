##### Abstract
Purpose: An end-to-end deep convolutional neural network (CNN) based on deep residual network (ResNet) was proposed to efficiently reconstruct reliable T2 mapping from single-shot OverLapping-Echo Detachment (OLED) planar imaging. Methods: The training dataset was obtained from simulations carried out on SPROM software developed by our group. The relationship between the original OLED image containing two echo signals and the corresponded T2 mapping was learned by ResNet training. After the ResNet was trained, it was applied to reconstruct the T2 mapping from simulation and in vivo human brain data. Results: Though the ResNet was trained entirely on simulated data, the trained network was generalized well to real human brain data. The results from simulation and in vivo human brain experiments show that the proposed method significantly outperformed the echo-detachment-based method. Reliable T2 mapping was achieved within tens of milliseconds after the network had been trained while the echo-detachment-based OLED reconstruction method took minutes. Conclusion: The proposed method will greatly facilitate real-time dynamic and quantitative MR imaging via OLED sequence, and ResNet has the potential to reconstruct images from complex MRI sequence efficiently.

目的：提出一种基于深度残差网络（ResNet）的端到端深度卷积神经网络（CNN），可以有效地从单次覆盖回波分离（OLED）平面成像中重建可靠的T2映射。方法：训练数据集是从我们团队开发的SPROM软件进行模拟得到的。通过ResNet训练学习了包含两个回波信号的原始OLED图像与相应的T2映射之间的关系。 ResNet训练后，将其应用于从模拟和体内人类大脑数据重建T2映射。结果：虽然ResNet完全是通过模拟数据进行训练的，但训练好的网络对于真实的人类大脑数据具有良好的推广能力。模拟和体内人脑实验的结果表明，所提出的方法明显优于基于回声 - 脱离的方法。在网络训练后的数十毫秒内实现了可靠的T2映射，而基于回波分离的OLED重建方法花了几分钟。结论：该方法将大大方便通过OLED序列实时动态定量磁共振成像，ResNet有望从复杂的MRI序列中有效地重建图像。
