##### Abstract
Detecting buffer overruns from a source code is one of the most common and yet challenging tasks in program analysis. Current approaches have mainly relied on rigid rules and handcrafted features devised by a few experts, limiting themselves in terms of flexible applicability and robustness due to diverse bug patterns and characteristics existing in sophisticated real-world software programs. In this paper, we propose a novel, data-driven approach that is completely end-to-end without requiring any hand-crafted features, thus free from any program language-specific structural limitations. In particular, our approach leverages a recently proposed neural network model called memory networks that have shown the state-of-the-art performances mainly in question-answering tasks. Our experimental results using source codes demonstrate that our proposed model is capable of accurately detecting simple buffer overruns. We also present in-depth analyses on how a memory network can learn to understand the semantics in programming languages solely from raw source codes, such as tracing variables of interest, identifying numerical values, and performing their quantitative comparisons.

从源代码中检测缓冲区溢出是程序分析中最常见也是最具挑战性的任务之一。目前的方法主要依赖于由一些专家设计的严格的规则和手工特征，由于复杂的现实世界软件程序中存在不同的错误模式和特征，所以限制了它们的灵活适用性和鲁棒性。在本文中，我们提出了一种新颖的，数据驱动的方法，它是完全端到端的，不需要任何手工功能，从而不受任何程序语言特定的结构限制。特别是，我们的方法利用了最近提出的称为记忆网络的神经网络模型，它显示了主要用于回答问题的最先进的表现。我们使用源代码的实验结果表明，我们提出的模型能够准确地检测简单的缓冲区溢出。我们还深入分析了内存网络如何学习如何从原始的源代码中完全理解编程语言的语义，例如追踪感兴趣的变量，识别数值以及进行定量比较。
