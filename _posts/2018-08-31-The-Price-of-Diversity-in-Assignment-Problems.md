##### Abstract
We introduce and analyze an extension to the matching problem on a weighted bipartite graph: Assignment with Type Constraints. The two parts of the graph are partitioned into subsets called types and blocks; we seek a matching with the largest sum of weights under the constraint that there is a pre-specified cap on the number of vertices matched in every type-block pair. Our primary motivation stems from the public housing program of Singapore, accounting for over 70\% of its residential real estate. To promote ethnic diversity within its housing projects, Singapore imposes ethnicity quotas: each new housing development comprises blocks of flats and each ethnicity-based group in the population must not own more than a certain percentage of flats in a block. Other domains using similar hard capacity constraints include matching prospective students to schools or medical residents to hospitals. Limiting agents' choices for ensuring diversity in this manner naturally entails some welfare loss. One of our goals is to study the trade-off between diversity and social welfare in such settings. We first show that, while the classic assignment program is polynomial-time computable, adding diversity constraints makes it computationally intractable; however, we identify a $\tfrac{1}{2}$-approximation algorithm, as well as reasonable assumptions on the weights that permit poly-time algorithms. Next, we provide two upper bounds on the {\em price of diversity} -- a measure of the loss in welfare incurred by imposing diversity constraints -- as functions of natural problem parameters. We conclude the paper with simulations based on publicly available data from two diversity-constrained allocation problems -- Singapore Public Housing and Chicago School Choice -- which shed light on how the constrained maximization as well as lottery-based variants perform in practice.

我们在加权二分图上引入和分析匹配问题的扩展：使用类型约束进行赋值。图的两个部分被划分为称为类型和块的子集;我们在约束条件下寻找与最大权重总和的匹配，即在每个类型块对中匹配的顶点数量上存在预先指定的上限。我们的主要动机来自新加坡的公共住房计划，占其住宅房地产的70％以上。为了在其住房项目中促进种族多样性，新加坡强加了种族配额：每个新的住房开发都包括公寓楼，每个种族群体中的人口不得拥有超过一定比例的单位。其他使用类似硬容量限制的域名包括将未来学生与学校或医疗居民匹配到医院。限制代理人以这种方式确保多样性的选择自然会带来一些福利损失。我们的目标之一是在这种环境中研究多样性与社会福利之间的权衡。我们首先表明，虽然经典赋值程序是多项式时间可计算的，但添加多样性约束使得它在计算上难以处理;然而，我们确定了$ \ tfrac {1} {2} $  - 近似算法，以及对允许多时间算法的权重的合理假设。接下来，我们提供了{\ em em of diversity}的两个上限 - 一个衡量通过强加多样性约束而产生的福利损失 - 作为自然问题参数的函数。我们根据两个多样性约束的分配问题 - 新加坡公共住房和芝加哥学校选择 - 公开提供的数据进行模拟，总结了受约束的最大化以及基于抽奖的变体在实践中的表现。
