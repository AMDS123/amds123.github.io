##### Abstract
Background and Object: In China, body constitution is highly related to physiological and pathological functions of human body and determines the tendency of the disease, which is of great importance for treatment in clinical medicine. Tongue diagnosis, as a key part of Traditional Chinese Medicine inspection, is an important way to recognize the type of constitution.In order to deploy tongue image constitution recognition system on non-invasive mobile device to achieve fast, efficient and accurate constitution recognition, an efficient method is required to deal with the challenge of this kind of complex environment. Methods: In this work, we perform the tongue area detection, tongue area calibration and constitution classification using methods which are based on deep convolutional neural network. Subject to the variation of inconstant environmental condition, the distribution of the picture is uneven, which has a bad effect on classification performance. To solve this problem, we propose a method based on the complexity of individual instances to divide dataset into two subsets and classify them separately, which is capable of improving classification accuracy. To evaluate the performance of our proposed method, we conduct experiments on three sizes of tongue datasets, in which deep convolutional neural network method and traditional digital image analysis method are respectively applied to extract features for tongue images. The proposed method is combined with the base classifier Softmax, SVM, and DecisionTree respectively. Results: As the experiments results shown, our proposed method improves the classification accuracy by 1.135% on average and achieves 59.99% constitution classification accuracy. Conclusions: Experimental results on three datasets show that our proposed method can effectively improve the classification accuracy of tongue constitution recognition.

背景和目的：在中国，体质与人体的生理和病理功能高度相关，决定了疾病的倾向性，这对于临床医学的治疗具有重要意义。舌诊作为中医检验的重要组成部分，是识别体质类型的重要手段。为了在非侵入性移动设备上部署舌象组构识别系统，实现快速，高效，准确的体质识别，需要有效的方法来应对这种复杂环境的挑战。方法：本研究采用基于深度卷积神经网络的方法进行舌面检测，舌面校正和体质分类。受环境条件变化的影响，图像分布不均匀，对分类性能影响不大。为了解决这个问题，我们提出了一种基于个体实例复杂度的方法，将数据集划分为两个子集并分别进行分类，从而提高分类精度。为了评估我们提出的方法的性能，我们在三种尺寸的舌头数据集上进行实验，其中使用深卷积神经网络方法和传统的数字图像分析方法来提取舌头图像的特征。所提出的方法分别与基本分类器Softmax，SVM和DecisionTree相结合。结果：实验结果表明，该方法提高了分类精度1.135％，平均分类准确率达59.99％。结论：三个数据集的实验结果表明，该方法能有效提高舌象识别的分类准确率。
