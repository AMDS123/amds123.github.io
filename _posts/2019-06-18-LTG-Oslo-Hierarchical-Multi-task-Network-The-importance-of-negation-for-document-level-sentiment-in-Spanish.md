##### Abstract
This paper details LTG-Oslo team's participation in the sentiment track of the NEGES 2019 evaluation campaign. We participated in the task with a hierarchical multi-task network, which used shared lower-layers in a deep BiLSTM to predict negation, while the higher layers were dedicated to predicting document-level sentiment. The multi-task component shows promise as a way to incorporate information on negation into deep neural sentiment classifiers, despite the fact that the absolute results on the test set were relatively low for a binary classification task.
