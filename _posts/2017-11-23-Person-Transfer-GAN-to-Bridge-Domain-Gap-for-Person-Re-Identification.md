##### Abstract
Although the performance of person Re-Identification (ReID) has been significantly boosted, many challenging issues in real scenarios have not been fully investigated, e.g., the complex scenes and lighting variations, viewpoint and pose changes, and the large number of identities in a camera network. To facilitate the research towards conquering those issues, this paper contributes a new dataset called MSMT17 with many important features, e.g., 1) the raw videos are taken by an 15-camera network deployed in both indoor and outdoor scenes, 2) the videos cover a long period of time and present complex lighting variations, and 3) it contains currently the largest number of annotated identities, i.e., 4,101 identities and 126,441 bounding boxes. We also observe that, domain gap commonly exists between datasets, which essentially causes severe performance drop when training and testing on different datasets. This results in that available training data cannot be effectively leveraged for new testing domains. To relieve the expensive costs of annotating new training samples, we propose a Person Transfer Generative Adversarial Network (PTGAN) to bridge the domain gap. Comprehensive experiments show that the domain gap could be substantially narrowed-down by the PTGAN.

尽管人物识别（ReID）的表现已经得到了显着的提升，但真实场景中的许多具有挑战性的问题还没有得到充分的研究，例如复杂的场景和灯光变化，观点和姿态的变化以及大量身份相机网络。为了便于研究解决这些问题，本文提出了一个新的数据集，称为MSMT17，它具有许多重要的特征，例如：1）原始视频是由室内和室外场景部署的15个摄像机网络拍摄的，2）视频封面很长一段时间，现在复杂的光照变化，3）它包含当前最多的注释标识，即4,101身份和126,441包围盒。我们还观察到，数据集之间通常存在领域差距，在不同数据集上进行训练和测试时，会导致严重的性能下降。这导致可用的培训数据不能有效地用于新的测试领域。为了减轻标注新训练样本的昂贵成本，我们提出了一个人际转移生成对抗网络（PTGAN）来填补领域空白。综合实验表明，PTGAN可以大大缩小领域差距。
