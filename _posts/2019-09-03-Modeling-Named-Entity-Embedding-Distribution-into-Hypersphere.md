##### Abstract
This work models named entity distribution from a way of visualizing topological structure of embedding space, so that we make an assumption that most, if not all, named entities (NEs) for a language tend to aggregate together to be accommodated by a specific hypersphere in embedding space. Thus we present a novel open definition for NE which alleviates the obvious drawback in previous closed NE definition with a limited NE dictionary. Then, we show two applications with introducing the proposed named entity hypersphere model. First, using a generative adversarial neural network to learn a transformation matrix of two embedding spaces, which results in a convenient determination of named entity distribution in the target language, indicating the potential of fast named entity discovery only using isomorphic relation between embedding spaces. Second, the named entity hypersphere model is directly integrated with various named entity recognition models over sentences to achieve state-of-the-art results. Only assuming that embeddings are available, we show a prior knowledge free approach on effective named entity distribution depiction.
