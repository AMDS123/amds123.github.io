##### Abstract
Failing to distinguish between a sheepdog and a skyscraper should be worse and penalized more than failing to distinguish between a sheepdog and a poodle; after all, sheepdogs and poodles are both breeds of dogs. However, existing metrics of failure (so-called "loss" or "win") used in textual or visual classification/recognition via neural networks seldom view a sheepdog as more similar to a poodle than to a skyscraper. We define a metric that, inter alia, can penalize failure to distinguish between a sheepdog and a skyscraper more than failure to distinguish between a sheepdog and a poodle. Unlike previously employed possibilities, this metric is based on an ultrametric tree associated with any given tree organization into a semantically meaningful hierarchy of a classifier's classes.

##### Abstract (translated by Google)
如果不区分牧羊犬和摩天大楼，应该更加恶劣，而不是区分牧羊犬和贵宾犬;毕竟，牧羊犬和贵宾犬都是狗的品种。然而，通过神经网络在文本或视觉分类/识别中使用的现有失败指标（所谓的“损失”或“胜利”）很少将绵羊狗视为与长卷毛狗相比更像是摩天大楼。我们定义了一个度量标准，除了区分牧羊犬和长卷毛狗之外，还可以惩罚没有区分牧羊犬和摩天大楼的标准。与以前所使用的可能性不同，此度量标准基于与任何给定树组织关联的超指定树，形成分类器类的语义上有意义的层次结构。
