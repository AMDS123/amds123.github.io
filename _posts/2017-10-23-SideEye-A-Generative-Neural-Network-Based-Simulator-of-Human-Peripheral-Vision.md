##### Abstract
Foveal vision makes up less than 1% of the visual field. The other 99% is peripheral vision. Precisely what human beings see in the periphery is both obvious and mysterious in that we see it with our own eyes but can't visualize what we see, except in controlled lab experiments. Degradation of information in the periphery is far more complex than what might be mimicked with a radial blur. Rather, behaviorally-validated models hypothesize that peripheral vision measures a large number of local texture statistics in pooling regions that overlap and grow with eccentricity. In this work, we develop a new method for peripheral vision simulation by training a generative neural network on a behaviorally-validated full-field synthesis model. By achieving a 21,000 fold reduction in running time, our approach is the first to combine realism and speed of peripheral vision simulation to a degree that provides a whole new way to approach visual design: through peripheral visualization.

中央凹视力占视野的1％以下。另外99％是周边视觉。准确地说，人类在周边看到的东西既明显又神秘，因为我们用自己的眼睛看到它，但除了在对照实验室的实验中，看不到我们所看到的。信息在外围的降级要比用径向模糊来模拟要复杂得多。相反，行为验证的模型假设周边视觉测量大量的局部纹理统计数据集中区域重叠和偏心增长。在这项工作中，我们开发了一种新的边缘视觉模拟方法，在行为验证的全场综合模型上训练生成神经网络。通过将运行时间减少21,000倍，我们的方法是首次将外围视觉模拟的真实性和速度结合到一个程度，为通过外围可视化提供了一种全新的视觉设计方法。
