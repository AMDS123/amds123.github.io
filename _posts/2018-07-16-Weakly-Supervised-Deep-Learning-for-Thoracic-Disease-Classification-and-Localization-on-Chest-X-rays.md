##### Abstract
Chest X-rays is one of the most commonly available and affordable radiological examinations in clinical practice. While detecting thoracic diseases on chest X-rays is still a challenging task for machine intelligence, due to 1) the highly varied appearance of lesion areas on X-rays from patients of different thoracic disease and 2) the shortage of accurate pixel-level annotations by radiologists for model training. Existing machine learning methods are unable to deal with the challenge that thoracic diseases usually happen in localized disease-specific areas. In this article, we propose a weakly supervised deep learning framework equipped with squeeze-and-excitation blocks, multi-map transfer, and max-min pooling for classifying thoracic diseases as well as localizing suspicious lesion regions. The comprehensive experiments and discussions are performed on the ChestX-ray14 dataset. Both numerical and visual results have demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed model and its better performance against the state-of-the-art pipelines.

胸部X光是临床实践中最常用和最经济的放射学检查之一。虽然检测胸部X射线上的胸部疾病仍然是机器智能的一项具有挑战性的任务，因为1）不同胸部疾病患者的X射线病变区域的高度变化和2）精确像素级注释的不足由放射科医师进行模型训练。现有的机器学习方法无法应对胸部疾病通常发生在局部疾病特定区域的挑战。在本文中，我们提出了一种弱监督的深度学习框架，该框架配备了挤压和激发块，多图转移和最大最小池，用于对胸部疾病进行分类以及定位可疑病变区域。在ChestX-ray14数据集上进行全面的实验和讨论。数值和视觉结果均证明了所提出模型的有效性及其对最先进管道的更好性能。
