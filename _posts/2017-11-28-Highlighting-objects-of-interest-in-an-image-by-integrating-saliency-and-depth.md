##### Abstract
Stereo images have been captured primarily for 3D reconstruction in the past. However, the depth information acquired from stereo can also be used along with saliency to highlight certain objects in a scene. This approach can be used to make still images more interesting to look at, and highlight objects of interest in the scene. We introduce this novel direction in this paper, and discuss the theoretical framework behind the approach. Even though we use depth from stereo in this work, our approach is applicable to depth data acquired from any sensor modality. Experimental results on both indoor and outdoor scenes demonstrate the benefits of our algorithm.

立体图像主要用于三维重建。然而，从立体声获得的深度信息也可以用于突出显示场景中的某些对象。这种方法可以用来使静态图像看起来更有趣，并突出显示场景中感兴趣的对象。本文介绍了这一新颖的方向，并讨论了该方法背后的理论框架。尽管我们在这项工作中使用了立体声的深度，但我们的方法适用于从任何传感器模式获取的深度数据。室内和室外场景的实验结果证明了我们的算法的好处。
