##### Abstract
In this paper, a novel method for automatic planogram compliance checking in retail chains is proposed without requiring product template images for training. Product layout is extracted from an input image by means of unsupervised recurring pattern detection and matched via graph matching with the expected product layout specified by a planogram to measure the level of compliance. A divide and conquer strategy is employed to improve the speed. Specifically, the input image is divided into several regions based on the planogram. Recurring patterns are detected in each region respectively and then merged together to estimate the product layout. Experimental results on real data have verified the efficacy of the proposed method. Compared with a template-based method, higher accuracies are achieved by the proposed method over a wide range of products.

在本文中，提出了一种不需要产品模板图像进行培训的零售链自动货架图符合性检查的新方法。通过无监督重现模式检测从输入图像中提取产品布局，并通过图形匹配与由货架图指定的预期产品布局进行匹配，以测量合规性水平。采取分而治之的策略来提高速度。具体而言，根据货架图将输入图像分割成多个区域。在每个区域分别检测重复出现的模式，然后合并在一起估计产品布局。实验数据的实验结果验证了所提方法的有效性。与基于模板的方法相比，通过所提出的方法在多种产品上实现更高的精确度。
