##### Abstract
With multiple crowd gatherings of millions of people every year in events ranging from pilgrimages to protests, concerts to marathons, and festivals to funerals; visual crowd analysis is emerging as a new frontier in computer vision. In particular, counting in highly dense crowds is a challenging problem with far-reaching applicability in crowd safety and management, as well as gauging political significance of protests and demonstrations. In this paper, we propose a novel approach that simultaneously solves the problems of counting, density map estimation and localization of people in a given dense crowd image. Our formulation is based on an important observation that the three problems are inherently related to each other making the loss function for optimizing a deep CNN decomposable. Since localization requires high-quality images and annotations, we introduce UCF-QNRF dataset that overcomes the shortcomings of previous datasets, and contains 1.25 million humans manually marked with dot annotations. Finally, we present evaluation measures and comparison with recent deep CNN networks, including those developed specifically for crowd counting. Our approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art on the new dataset, which is the most challenging dataset with the largest number of crowd annotations in the most diverse set of scenes.

每年有数百万人聚集在一起，举办各种活动，包括朝圣，抗议，音乐会，马拉松，节日和葬礼;视觉人群分析正在成为计算机视觉领域的新前沿。特别是，在高密度人群中进行计数是一个具有挑战性的问题，在人群安全和管理方面具有广泛的适用性，以及衡量抗议和示威的政治意义。在本文中，我们提出了一种新的方法，同时解决了给定密集人群图像中的计数，密度图估计和人的定位问题。我们的公式是基于一个重要的观察结果，即这三个问题本质上是相互关联的，使得优化深度CNN可分解的损失函数。由于本地化需要高质量的图像和注释，我们引入UCF-QNRF数据集，克服了以前数据集的缺点，并包含125万人手动标记点注释。最后，我们提出评估措施并与最近的深度CNN网络进行比较，包括那些专门为人群计数而开发的网络。我们的方法明显优于新数据集的最新技术，这是最具挑战性的数据集，在最多样化的场景中拥有最多的人群注释。
