##### Abstract
Over many decades, researchers working in object recognition have longed for an end-to-end automated system that will simply accept 2D or 3D image or videos as inputs and output the labels of objects in the input data. Computer vision methods that use representations derived based on geometric, radiometric and neural considerations and statistical and structural matchers and artificial neural network-based methods where a multi-layer network learns the mapping from inputs to class labels have provided competing approaches for image recognition problems. Over the last four years, methods based on Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (DCNNs) have shown impressive performance improvements on object detection/recognition challenge problems. This has been made possible due to the availability of large annotated data, a better understanding of the non-linear mapping between image and class labels as well as the affordability of GPUs. In this paper, we present a brief history of developments in computer vision and artificial neural networks over the last forty years for the problem of image-based recognition. We then present the design details of a deep learning system for end-to-end unconstrained face verification/recognition. Some open issues regarding DCNNs for object recognition problems are then discussed. We caution the readers that the views expressed in this paper are from the authors and authors only!

##### Abstract (translated by Google)
数十年来，从事物体识别的研究人员都渴望一种端到端的自动化系统，它只需接受2D或3D图像或视频作为输入，并在输入数据中输出对象的标签。计算机视觉方法使用基于几何，放射性和神经考虑以及统计和结构匹配器以及基于人工神经网络的方法（其中多层网络学习从输入到类别标签的映射）导出的表示形式导出的计算机视觉方法为图像识别问题提供了竞争方法。在过去四年中，基于深度卷积神经网络（DCNN）的方法已经在物体检测/识别挑战问题上显示出令人印象深刻的性能改进。由于大量注释数据的可用性，对图像和类别标签之间的非线性映射的更好理解，以及GPU的支付能力，这已经成为可能。在本文中，我们介绍了近40年来基于图像识别问题的计算机视觉和人工神经网络的发展简史。然后，我们介绍一个深度学习系统的端到端无约束人脸验证/识别的设计细节。然后讨论一些有关DCNN在物体识别问题上的公开问题。我们告诫读者，本文所表达的意见仅来自作者和作者！
