##### Abstract
We introduce a synthetic dataset for evaluating non-rigid 3D human reconstruction based on conventional RGB-D cameras. The dataset consist of seven motion sequences of a single human model. For each motion sequence per-frame ground truth geometry and ground truth skeleton are given. The dataset also contains skinning weights of the human model. More information about the dataset can be found at: https://research.csiro.au/robotics/our-work/databases/synthetic-human-model-dataset/
