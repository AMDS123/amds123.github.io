##### Abstract
This paper tackles algorithmic and theoretical aspects of dictionary learning from incomplete and random block-wise image measurements and the performance of the adaptive dictionary for sparse image recovery. This problem is related to blind compressed sensing in which the sparsifying dictionary or basis is viewed as an unknown variable and subject to estimation during sparse recovery. However, unlike existing guarantees for a successful blind compressed sensing, our results do not rely on additional structural constraints on the learned dictionary or the measured signal. In particular, we rely on the spatial diversity of compressive measurements to guarantee that the solution is unique with a high probability. Moreover, our distinguishing goal is to measure and reduce the estimation error with respect to the ideal dictionary that is based on the complete image. Using recent results from random matrix theory, we show that applying a slightly modified dictionary learning algorithm over compressive measurements results in accurate estimation of the ideal dictionary for large-scale images. Empirically, we experiment with both space-invariant and space-varying sensing matrices and demonstrate the critical role of spatial diversity in measurements. Simulation results confirm that the presented algorithm outperforms the typical non-adaptive sparse recovery based on offline-learned universal dictionaries.

本文从不完全随机块图像测量和自适应字典的稀疏图像恢复性能出发，解决了字典学习的算法和理论问题。这个问题与盲压缩感知有关，其中稀疏字典或基础被视为未知变量，并在稀疏恢复期间进行估计。然而，与现有的成功的盲压缩感测保证不同，我们的结果不依赖于学习的字典或测量信号的附加结构约束。特别是，我们依靠压缩测量的空间多样性来保证解决方案的独特性和高概率。而且，我们的区别目标是针对基于完整图像的理想字典来测量和减少估计误差。利用随机矩阵理论的最新结果，我们表明，在压缩测量中应用略微修改的字典学习算法导致对于大规模图像的理想字典的精确估计。经验上，我们试验了空间不变和空间变化的传感矩阵，并展示了空间多样性在测量中的关键作用。仿真结果表明，该算法优于基于离线学习的通用字典的典型非自适应稀疏恢复算法。
