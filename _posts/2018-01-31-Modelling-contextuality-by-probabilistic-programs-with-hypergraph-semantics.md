##### Abstract
Models of a phenomenon are often developed by examining it under different experimental conditions, or measurement contexts. The resultant probabilistic models assume that the underlying random variables, which define a measurable set of outcomes, can be defined independent of the measurement context. The phenomenon is deemed contextual when this assumption fails. Contextuality is an important issue in quantum physics. However, there has been growing speculation that it manifests outside the quantum realm with human cognition being a particularly prominent area of investigation. This article contributes the foundations of a probabilistic programming language that allows convenient exploration of contextuality in wide range of applications relevant to cognitive science and artificial intelligence. Specific syntax is proposed to allow the specification of "measurement contexts". Each such context delivers a partial model of the phenomenon based on the associated experimental condition described by the measurement context. The probabilistic program is translated into a hypergraph in a modular way. Recent theoretical results from the field of quantum physics show that contextuality can be equated with the possibility of constructing a probabilistic model on the resulting hypergraph. The use of hypergraphs opens the door for a theoretically succinct and efficient computational semantics sensitive to modelling both contextual and non-contextual phenomena. Finally, this article raises awareness of contextuality beyond quantum physics and to contribute formal methods to detect its presence by means of hypergraph semantics.

##### Abstract (translated by Google)
现象的模型往往是通过在不同的实验条件或测量环境下进行研究来开发的。由此产生的概率模型假定可以定义一组可测量的结果的潜在随机变量可以独立于测量上下文来定义。当这种假设失败时，这种现象被认为是上下文的。语境是量子物理中的一个重要问题。然而，人们越来越认为它是在量子领域之外展现出来的，人类的认知是一个特别突出的研究领域。本文为概率编程语言奠定了基础，可以在与认知科学和人工智能有关的广泛应用中方便地探索语境。提出了特定的语法来允许指定“测量上下文”。每个这样的上下文基于由测量上下文描述的相关实验条件来提供该现象的部分模型。概率程序以模块化方式被翻译成超图。量子物理学领域最近的理论结果表明，情境可以等同于在超图上构建概率模型的可能性。超图的使用打开了一个理论上简洁和高效的计算语义的大门，敏感于对语境和非语境现象建模。最后，本文提出了超越量子物理的情境性意识，并提供形式化的方法来通过超图语义来检测其存在。
