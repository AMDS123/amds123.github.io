##### Abstract
The basic features of some of the most versatile and popular open source frameworks for machine learning (TensorFlow, Deep Learning4j, and H2O) are considered and compared. Their comparative analysis was performed and conclusions were made as to the advantages and disadvantages of these platforms. The performance tests for the de facto standard MNIST data set were carried out on H2O framework for deep learning algorithms designed for CPU and GPU platforms for single-threaded and multithreaded modes of operation Also, we present the results of testing neural networks architectures on H2O platform for various activation functions, stopping metrics, and other parameters of machine learning algorithm. It was demonstrated for the use case of MNIST database of handwritten digits in single-threaded mode that blind selection of these parameters can hugely increase (by 2-3 orders) the runtime without the significant increase of precision. This result can have crucial influence for optimization of available and new machine learning methods, especially for image recognition problems.

考虑并比较了一些最通用和流行的机器学习开放框架（TensorFlow，Deep Learning4j和H2O）的基本特征。他们进行了比较分析，并就这些平台的优缺点作出结论。对于事实上的标准MNIST数据集的性能测试是在针对用于单线程和多线程操作模式的CPU和GPU平台设计的深度学习算法的H2O框架上进行的。此外，我们提供了在H2O平台上测试神经网络结构的结果用于各种激活功能，停止度量以及机器学习算法的其他参数。在单线程模式下的手写数字MNIST数据库的使用情况已经得到证实，盲目选择这些参数可以大大增加（2-3个命令）运行时间，而不会显着提高精度。这一结果对于现有的和新的机器学习方法的优化，特别是对于图像识别问题，具有至关重要的影响。
