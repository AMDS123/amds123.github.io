##### Abstract
This paper proposes a novel robotic hand design for assembly tasks. The idea is to combine two simple grippers -- an inner gripper which is used for precise alignment, and an outer gripper which is used for stable holding. Conventional robotic hands require complicated compliant mechanisms or complicated control strategy and force sensing to conduct assemble tasks, which makes them costly and difficult to pick and arrange small objects like screws or washers. Compared to the conventional hands, the proposed design provides a low-cost solution for aligning, picking up, and arranging various objects by taking advantages of the geometric constraints of the positioning fingers and gravity. It is able to deal with small screws and washers, and eliminate the position errors of cylindrical objects or objects with cylindrical holes. In the experiments, both real-world tasks and quantitative analysis are performed to validate the aligning, picking, and arrangements abilities of the design.

本文提出了一种用于装配任务的新型机器人手部设计。我们的想法是将两个简单的夹具组合在一起 - 一个用于精确对准的内夹具和一个用于稳定夹持的外夹具。传统的机器人手需要复杂的顺应机构或复杂的控制策略和力传感来进行组装任务，这使得它们昂贵且难以拾取和布置诸如螺钉或垫圈的小物体。与传统指针相比，所提出的设计通过利用定位指状物和重力的几何约束来提供用于对准，拾取和布置各种物体的低成本解决方案。它能够处理小螺钉和垫圈，并消除圆柱形物体或圆柱孔物体的位置误差。在实验中，执行实际任务和定量分析以验证设计的对齐，拾取和布置能力。
