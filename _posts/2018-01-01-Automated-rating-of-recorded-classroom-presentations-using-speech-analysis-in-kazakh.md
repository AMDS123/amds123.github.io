##### Abstract
Effective presentation skills can help to succeed in business, career and academy. This paper presents the design of speech assessment during the oral presentation and the algorithm for speech evaluation based on criteria of optimal intonation. As the pace of the speech and its optimal intonation varies from language to language, developing an automatic identification of language during the presentation is required. Proposed algorithm was tested with presentations delivered in Kazakh language. For testing purposes the features of Kazakh phonemes were extracted using MFCC and PLP methods and created a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) [5], [5] of Kazakh phonemes. Kazakh vowel formants were defined and the correlation between the deviation rate in fundamental frequency and the liveliness of the speech to evaluate intonation of the presentation was analyzed. It was established that the threshold value between monotone and dynamic speech is 0.16 and the error for intonation evaluation is 19%.

有效的演讲技巧可以帮助企业，职业和学院取得成功。本文介绍了口头演讲中语音评估的设计和基于最佳语调标准的语音评估算法。由于演讲的速度及其最佳语调随语言的不同而不同，因此需要在演示过程中自动识别语言。提出的算法是用哈萨克语的语言进行测试的。为了测试目的，使用MFCC和PLP方法提取哈萨克音素的特征，并创建哈萨克音素的隐马尔可夫模型（HMM）[5]，[5]。对哈萨克语元音形式进行了定义，并分析了基本频率偏差率与言语活跃度之间的相关性，以评估表达的语调。确定单调和动态语音之间的阈值为0.16，语调评估误差为19％。
