##### Abstract
Understanding customer sentiments is of paramount importance in marketing strategies today. Not only will it give companies an insight as to how customers perceive their products and/or services, but it will also give them an idea on how to improve their offers. This paper attempts to understand the correlation of different variables in customer reviews on a women clothing e-commerce, and to classify each review whether it recommends the reviewed product or not and whether it consists of positive, negative, or neutral sentiment. To achieve these goals, we employed univariate and multivariate analyses on dataset features except for review titles and review texts, and we implemented a bidirectional recurrent neural network (RNN) with long-short term memory unit (LSTM) for recommendation and sentiment classification. Results have shown that a recommendation is a strong indicator of a positive sentiment score, and vice-versa. On the other hand, ratings in product reviews are fuzzy indicators of sentiment scores. We also found out that the bidirectional LSTM was able to reach an F1-score of 0.88 for recommendation classification, and 0.93 for sentiment classification.

了解客户情绪对于今天的营销策略至关重要。它不仅可以让公司了解客户如何看待他们的产品和/或服务，还可以让他们了解如何改进他们的服务。本文试图了解顾客评论中女性服装电子商务中不同变量之间的相关性，并将每个评论分为不同的推荐评论产品以及是否包含积极，消极或中性的情绪。为了实现这些目标，我们对数据集特征进行了单变量和多变量分析，除了评论标题和评论文本，我们实现了一个具有长期短期记忆单元（LSTM）的双向递归神经网络（RNN），用于推荐和情感分类。结果显示，推荐是积极情绪评分的有力指标，反之亦然。另一方面，产品评论中的评分是情绪分数的模糊指标。我们还发现，双向LSTM能够达到建议分类的0.88的F1分数，以及情感分类的0.93。
