##### Abstract
Convolutional Neural Network is known as ConvNet have been extensively used in many complex machine learning tasks. However, hyperparameters optimization is one of a crucial step in developing ConvNet architectures, since the accuracy and performance are reliant on the hyperparameters. This multilayered architecture parameterized by a set of hyperparameters such as the number of convolutional layers, number of fully connected dense layers & neurons, the probability of dropout implementation, learning rate. Hence the searching the hyperparameter over the hyperparameter space are highly difficult to build such complex hierarchical architecture. Many methods have been proposed over the decade to explore the hyperparameter space and find the optimum set of hyperparameter values. Reportedly, Gird search and Random search are said to be inefficient and extremely expensive, due to a large number of hyperparameters of the architecture. Hence, Sequential model-based Bayesian Optimization is a promising alternative technique to address the extreme of the unknown cost function. The recent study on Bayesian Optimization by Snoek in nine convolutional network parameters is achieved the lowerest error report in the CIFAR-10 benchmark. This article is intended to provide the overview of the mathematical concept behind the Bayesian Optimization over a Gaussian prior.

卷积神经网络被称为ConvNet已被广泛用于许多复杂的机器学习任务。然而，超参数优化是开发ConvNet体系结构的关键步骤之一，因为准确性和性能依赖于超参数。这种多层体系结构由一组超参数参数化，例如卷积层的数量，完全连接的密集层和神经元的数量，实现丢失的概率，学习速率。因此，在超参数空间上搜索超参数非常难以建立如此复杂的分层体系结构。为了探索超参数空间并找到最优的一组超参数值，已经提出了许多方法。据报道，由于架构的大量超参数，Gird搜索和随机搜索被认为效率低下且非常昂贵。因此，基于序列模型的贝叶斯优化是解决未知成本函数的极端的有前途的替代技术。 Snoek最近对9个卷积网络参数进行贝叶斯优化的研究，实现了CIFAR-10基准下的最低误差报告。本文旨在提供高斯先验贝叶斯优化背后数学概念的概述。
