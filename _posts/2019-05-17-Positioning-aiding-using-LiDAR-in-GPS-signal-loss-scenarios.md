##### Abstract
In the presented scenario, an autonomous surface vehicle (ASV) equipped with a laser scanner navigates on a inland pathway surrounded and crossed by man-made structures such as bridges and locks. {GPS} receiver present on board experiences signal loss and multipath reflections in situation when the view of the sky is obscured by a bridge or tall buildings. In both cases, a potentially dangerous situation is provoked as the robot has no or inaccurate positioning data. A sensor data processing scheme is proposed where these gaps are smoothly filled in by positioning data generated from scan matching and registration of the laser data. This article shows preliminary results of positioning data improvement during trials in harbor-river environment.
