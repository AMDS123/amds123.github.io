##### Abstract
With a great amount of research going on in the field of autonomous vehicles or self-driving cars, there has been considerable progress in road detection and tracking algorithms. Most of these algorithms use GPS to handle road junctions and its subsequent decisions. However, there are places in the urban environment where it becomes difficult to get GPS fixes which render the junction decision handling erroneous or possibly risky. Vision-based junction detection, however, does not have such problems. This paper proposes a novel deep convolutional neural network architecture for disambiguation of junctions from roads with a high degree of accuracy. This network is benchmarked against other well known classifying network architectures like AlexNet and VGGnet. Further, we discuss a potential road navigation methodology which uses the proposed network model. We conclude by performing an experimental validation of the trained network and the navigational method on the roads of the Indian Institute of Science (IISc).

随着自动驾驶汽车或自动驾驶汽车领域的大量研究，道路检测和跟踪算法取得了相当大的进展。大多数这些算法使用GPS来处理道路交叉点及其后续决策。然而，在城市环境中存在难以获得GPS修复的地方，这使得交叉决策处理错误或可能存在风险。然而，基于视觉的结点检测没有这样的问题。本文提出了一种新的深度卷积神经网络结构，用于高度准确地消除道路交叉点的歧义。该网络与其他众所周知的分类网络架构（如AlexNet和VGGnet）进行了对比。此外，我们讨论了使用所提出的网络模型的潜在道路导航方法。最后，我们对印度科学研究所（IISc）的道路上的训练网络和导航方法进行了实验验证。
