##### Abstract
Nowadays, the Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have achieved impressive performance on many computer vision related tasks, such as object detection, image recognition, image retrieval, etc. These achievements benefit from the CNNs outstanding capability to learn the input features with deep layers of neuron structures and iterative training process. However, these learned features are hard to identify and interpret from a human vision perspective, causing a lack of understanding of the CNNs internal working mechanism. To improve the CNN interpretability, the CNN visualization is well utilized as a qualitative analysis method, which translates the internal features into visually perceptible patterns. And many CNN visualization works have been proposed in the literature to interpret the CNN in perspectives of network structure, operation, and semantic concept. In this paper, we expect to provide a comprehensive survey of several representative CNN visualization methods, including Activation Maximization, Network Inversion, Deconvolutional Neural Networks (DeconvNet), and Network Dissection based visualization. These methods are presented in terms of motivations, algorithms, and experiment results. Based on these visualization methods, we also discuss their practical applications to demonstrate the significance of the CNN interpretability in areas of network design, optimization, security enhancement, etc.

目前，卷积神经网络（CNNs）已经在许多与计算机视觉相关的任务中获得了令人印象深刻的性能，如物体检测，图像识别，图像检索等等。这些成果受益于CNN具有深入学习输入特征的出色能力神经元结构和迭代训练过程。然而，从人类视觉角度来看，这些学习功能很难被识别和解释，导致对CNN内部工作机制的理解不足。为了提高CNN可解释性，CNN可视化被很好地用作定性分析方法，其将内部特征转化为视觉可察觉模式。许多CNN可视化作品已经在文献中被提出来从网络结构，操作和语义概念的角度来解释CNN。在本文中，我们期望对包括激活最大化，网络反演，解卷积神经网络（DeconvNet）和基于网络解剖的可视化在内的几种代表性CNN可视化方法进行全面的调查。这些方法以动机，算法和实验结果的形式呈现。基于这些可视化方法，我们还讨论了它们的实际应用，以证明CNN在网络设计，优化，安全增强等领域的解释性的重要性。
