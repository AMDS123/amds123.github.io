##### Abstract
A resistive memory network that has no crossover wiring is proposed to overcome the hardware limitations to size and functional complexity that is associated with conventional analogue neural networks. The proposed memory network is based on simple network cells that are arranged in a hierarchical modular architecture. Cognitive functionality of this network is demonstrated by an example of character recognition. The network is trained by an evolutionary process to completely recognise characters deformed by random noise, rotation, scaling and shifting

提出了一种没有交叉布线的电阻式存储器网络，以克服传统模拟神经网络的硬件尺寸和功能复杂度的限制。所提出的存储器网络基于简单的网络单元，这些网络单元被布置在分层模块化架构中。这个网络的认知功能通过一个字符识别的例子来说明。网络通过演化过程来训练，以完全识别由随机噪声，旋转，缩放和移位而变形的字符
