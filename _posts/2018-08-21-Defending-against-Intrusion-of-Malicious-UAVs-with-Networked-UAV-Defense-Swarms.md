##### Abstract
Nowadays, companies such as Amazon, Alibaba, and even pizza chains are pushing forward to use drones, also called UAVs (Unmanned Aerial Vehicles), for service provision, such as package and food delivery. As governments intend to use these immense economic benefits that UAVs have to offer, urban planners are moving forward to incorporate so-called UAV flight zones and UAV highways in their smart city designs. However, the high-speed mobility and behavior dynamics of UAVs need to be monitored to detect and, subsequently, to deal with intruders, rogue drones, and UAVs with a malicious intent. 
 This paper proposes a UAV defense system for the purpose of intercepting and escorting a malicious UAV outside the flight zone. The proposed UAV defense system consists of a defense UAV swarm, which is capable to self-organize its defense formation in the event of intruder detection, and chase the malicious UAV as a networked swarm. 
 Modular design principles have been used for our fully localized approach. We developed an innovative auto-balanced clustering process to realize the intercept- and capture-formation. As it turned out, the resulting networked defense UAV swarm is resilient against communication losses. Finally, a prototype UAV simulator has been implemented. Through extensive simulations, we show the feasibility and performance of our approach.

##### Abstract (translated by Google)
如今，像亚马逊，阿里巴巴甚至披萨连锁店这样的公司正在推动使用无人机（也称为无人机）来提供服务，例如包装和食品配送。由于政府打算利用无人机必须提供的巨大经济效益，城市规划者正在向智能城市设计中采用所谓的无人机飞行区和无人机高速公路。然而，需要监视无人机的高速移动性和行为动态以检测并随后以恶意目的处理入侵者，流氓无人机和无人机。
 本文提出了一种无人机防御系统，用于拦截和护送飞行区外的恶意无人机。所提出的无人机防御系统包括防御无人机群，其能够在入侵者检测的情况下自我组织其防御形成，并且将恶意无人机作为网络群追逐。
 模块化设计原则已用于我们的完全本地化方法。我们开发了一种创新的自动平衡聚类过程，以实现拦截和捕获形成。事实证明，由此产生的网络防御无人机群体可以抵御通信损失。最后，实现了原型UAV模拟器。通过广泛的模拟，我们展示了我们的方法的可行性和性能。
