##### Abstract
Wireless Capsule Endoscopy (WCE) is relatively a new technology to examine the entire GI trace. During an examination, it captures more than 55,000 frames. Reviewing all these images is time-consuming and prone to human error. It has been a challenge to develop intelligent methods assisting physicians to review the frames. The WCE frames are captured in 8-bit color depths which provides enough a color range to detect abnormalities. Here, superpixel based methods are proposed to segment five diseases including: bleeding, Crohn's disease, Lymphangiectasia, Xanthoma, and Lymphoid hyperplasia. Two superpixels methods are compared to provide semantic segmentation of these prolific diseases: simple linear iterative clustering (SLIC) and quick shift (QS). The segmented superpixels were classified into two classes (normal and abnormal) by support vector machine (SVM) using texture and color features. For both superpixel methods, the accuracy, specificity, sensitivity, and precision (SLIC, QS) were around 92%, 93%, 93%, and 88%, respectively. However, SLIC was dramatically faster than QS.

无线胶囊内镜（WCE）是一种相对较新的技术来检查整个胃肠道。在考试期间，它捕获了超过55000帧。审查所有这些图像是耗时的，并且容易出现人为错误。开发智能方法来协助医生检查框架是一项挑战。 WCE帧以8位色彩深度捕获，提供足够的色彩范围来检测异常情况。在这里，基于超像素的方法被提出来分割五种疾病，包括：出血，克罗恩氏病，淋巴管扩张症，黄色瘤和淋巴样增生。比较两种超像素方法以提供这些多产疾病的语义分割：简单线性迭代聚类（SLIC）和快速移位（QS）。通过支持向量机（SVM），使用纹理和颜色特征将分割的超像素分为两类（正常和异常）。对于这两种超像素方法，准确性，特异性，灵敏度和精密度（SLIC，QS）分别为92％，93％，93％和88％。但是，SLIC比QS快得多。
