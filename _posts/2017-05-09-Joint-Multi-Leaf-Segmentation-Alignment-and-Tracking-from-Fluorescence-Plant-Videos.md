##### Abstract
This paper proposes a novel framework for fluorescence plant video processing. The plant research community is interested in the leaf-level photosynthetic analysis within a plant. A prerequisite for such analysis is to segment all leaves, estimate their structures, and track them over time. We identify this as a joint multi-leaf segmentation, alignment, and tracking problem. First, leaf segmentation and alignment are applied on the last frame of a plant video to find a number of well-aligned leaf candidates. Second, leaf tracking is applied on the remaining frames with leaf candidate transformation from the previous frame. We form two optimization problems with shared terms in their objective functions for leaf alignment and tracking respectively. A quantitative evaluation framework is formulated to evaluate the performance of our algorithm with four metrics. Two models are learned to predict the alignment accuracy and detect tracking failure respectively in order to provide guidance for subsequent plant biology analysis. The limitation of our algorithm is also studied. Experimental results show the effectiveness, efficiency, and robustness of the proposed method.

本文提出了一个新的荧光厂视频处理框架。植物研究界对植物叶片光合作用的分析很感兴趣。这种分析的先决条件是分割所有的叶子，估计它们的结构，并随着时间的推移跟踪它们。我们将其识别为联合多叶分割，对齐和跟踪问题。首先，在植物视频的最后一帧应用叶分割和对齐以找到许多对齐的叶候选者。其次，对来自前一帧的叶候选转换的剩余帧应用叶跟踪。我们分别在它们的叶子对齐和跟踪的目标函数中形成两个共享项的优化问题。定量评估框架的制定，以评估我们的算法与四个指标的性能。学习两种模型分别预测对准精度和检测跟踪失败，为后续植物生物学分析提供指导。我们的算法的局限性也被研究。实验结果表明了该方法的有效性，有效性和鲁棒性。
