##### Abstract
This paper describes the architecture and implementation of a rule-based grapheme to phoneme converter for Turkish. The system accepts surface form as input, outputs SAMPA mapping of the all parallel pronounciations according to the morphological analysis together with stress positions. The system has been implemented in Python
