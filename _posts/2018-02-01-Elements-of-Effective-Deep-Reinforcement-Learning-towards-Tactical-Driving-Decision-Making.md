##### Abstract
Tactical driving decision making is crucial for autonomous driving systems and has attracted considerable interest in recent years. In this paper, we propose several practical components that can speed up deep reinforcement learning algorithms towards tactical decision making tasks: 1) non-uniform action skipping as a more stable alternative to action-repetition frame skipping, 2) a counter-based penalty for lanes on which ego vehicle has less right-of-road, and 3) heuristic inference-time action masking for apparently undesirable actions. We evaluate the proposed components in a realistic driving simulator and compare them with several baselines. Results show that the proposed scheme provides superior performance in terms of safety, efficiency, and comfort.

战术驾驶决策对于自主驾驶系统至关重要，近年来引起了相当大的兴趣。在本文中，我们提出了几个实用的组件，可以加速深层强化学习算法的战术决策的任务：1）非统一行动跳过作为一个更稳定的替代行动重复跳帧，2）基于计数器的惩罚自行车在其上的道路较少的车道，以及3）启发式推理 - 时间动作掩蔽显然不希望的行为。我们在一个逼真的驾驶模拟器中评估提出的组件，并将它们与几个基线进行比较。结果表明，所提出的方案在安全性，效率和舒适性方面提供了优越的性能。
