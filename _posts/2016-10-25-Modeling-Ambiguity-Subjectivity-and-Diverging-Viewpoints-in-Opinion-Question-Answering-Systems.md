##### Abstract
Product review websites provide an incredible lens into the wide variety of opinions and experiences of different people, and play a critical role in helping users discover products that match their personal needs and preferences. To help address questions that can't easily be answered by reading others' reviews, some review websites also allow users to pose questions to the community via a question-answering (QA) system. As one would expect, just as opinions diverge among different reviewers, answers to such questions may also be subjective, opinionated, and divergent. This means that answering such questions automatically is quite different from traditional QA tasks, where it is assumed that a single `correct' answer is available. While recent work introduced the idea of question-answering using product reviews, it did not account for two aspects that we consider in this paper: (1) Questions have multiple, often divergent, answers, and this full spectrum of answers should somehow be used to train the system; and (2) What makes a `good' answer depends on the asker and the answerer, and these factors should be incorporated in order for the system to be more personalized. Here we build a new QA dataset with 800 thousand questions---and over 3.1 million answers---and show that explicitly accounting for personalization and ambiguity leads both to quantitatively better answers, but also a more nuanced view of the range of supporting, but subjective, opinions.

产品评论网站为不同人的各种观点和经验提供了一个令人难以置信的镜头，在帮助用户发现符合他们个人需求和喜好的产品方面发挥着至关重要的作用。为了解决难以通过阅读他人评论回答的问题，一些评论网站还允许用户通过问答系统（QA）向社区提出问题。正如人们所期望的那样，正如不同评论者之间的意见分歧一样，这些问题的答案也可能是主观的，自以为是的，不同的。这意味着自动回答这些问题与传统的质量保证任务完全不同，因为假定一个“正确的”答案是可用的。尽管最近的工作引入了使用产品评论回答问题的思想，但是它并没有考虑到本文考虑的两个方面：（1）问题有多个常常不同的答案，应该以某种方式培训系统; （2）“好”的答案取决于提问者和回答者，这些因素应该被合并，以使系统更加个性化。在这里，我们建立了一个80万个问题的新QA数据集 - 超过310万个答案 - 并且显示明确地说明个性化和含糊不清会导致数量上更好的答案，而且对支持的范围，但主观，意见。
