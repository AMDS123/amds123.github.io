##### Abstract
Sparse regression methods have been proven effective in a wide range of signal processing problems such as image compression, speech coding, channel equalization, linear regression and classification. In this paper a new convex method of hyperspectral image classification is developed based on the sparse unmixing algorithm SUnSAL for which a pixel adaptive L1-norm regularization term is introduced. To further enhance class separability, the algorithm is kernelized using an RBF kernel and the final results are improved by a combination of spatial pre and post-processing operations. It is shown that the proposed method is competitive with state of the art algorithms such as SVM-CK, KSOMP-CK and KSSP-CK.

稀疏回归方法在广泛的信号处理问题（如图像压缩，语音编码，通道均衡，线性回归和分类）中已被证明是有效的。本文提出了一种基于稀疏解混算法SUnSAL的高光谱图像分类新方法，该算法引入了像素自适应L1范数正则化项。为了进一步增强类的可分性，该算法使用RBF核进行核化，并通过空间预处理和后处理操作的组合来改善最终结果。结果表明，该方法与SVM-CK，KSOMP-CK和KSSP-CK等现有算法相竞争。
