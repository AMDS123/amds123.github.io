##### Abstract
Coverage of image features play an important role in many vision algorithms since their distribution affect the estimated homography. This paper presents a Genetic Algorithm (GA) in order to select the optimal set of features yielding maximum coverage of the image which is measured by a robust method based on spatial statistics. It is shown with statistical tests on two datasets that the metric yields better coverage and this is also confirmed by an accuracy test on the computed homography for the original set and the newly selected set of features. Results have demonstrated that the new set has similar performance in terms of the accuracy of the computed homography with the original one with an extra benefit of using fewer number of features ultimately reducing the time required for descriptor calculation and matching.

图像特征的覆盖在许多视觉算法中起重要作用，因为它们的分布影响估计的单应性。本文提出了一种基于空间统计的遗传算法（GA），以选择最优的一组特征，得到最大的图像覆盖范围。对两个数据集的统计测试显示，该度量产生更好的覆盖范围，并且这也通过对原始集合和新选择的特征集合的计算单应性的准确性测试来证实。结果表明，新的集合在计算单应性与原始单应性的准确性方面具有相似的性能，并具有使用更少数量的特征最终减少描述符计算和匹配所需的时间的额外益处。
