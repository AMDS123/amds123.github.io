##### Abstract
Most work on natural language question answering today focuses on answer selection: given a candidate list of sentences, determine which contains the answer. Although important, answer selection is only one stage in a standard end-to-end question answering pipeline. This paper explores the effectiveness of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for answer selection in an end-to-end context using the standard TrecQA dataset. We observe that a simple idf-weighted word overlap algorithm forms a very strong baseline, and that despite substantial efforts by the community in applying deep learning to tackle answer selection, the gains are modest at best on this dataset. Furthermore, it is unclear if a CNN is more effective than the baseline in an end-to-end context based on standard retrieval metrics. To further explore this finding, we conducted a manual user evaluation, which confirms that answers from the CNN are detectably better than those from idf-weighted word overlap. This result suggests that users are sensitive to relatively small differences in answer selection quality.

今天大多数关于自然语言问题解答的工作都集中在答案选择上：给出候选的句子列表，确定哪个答案包含答案。答案选择虽然很重要，但在标准的端到端问题回答管道中只是一个阶段。本文探讨了使用标准TrecQA数据集的卷积神经网络（CNN）在端到端上下文中应答选择的有效性。我们观察到，一个简单的idf加权词重叠算法形成了一个非常强大的基线，尽管社区在应用深度学习来解决答案选择方面做出了巨大的努力，但是对于这个数据集来说收益最好是适度的。此外，基于标准检索度量标准，CNN在基于端到端的情况下是否比基线更有效还不清楚。为了进一步探索这一发现，我们进行了手动用户评估，这证实了来自CNN的答案明显好于来自idf加权词重叠的答案。这个结果表明用户对答案选择质量的相对较小差异敏感。
