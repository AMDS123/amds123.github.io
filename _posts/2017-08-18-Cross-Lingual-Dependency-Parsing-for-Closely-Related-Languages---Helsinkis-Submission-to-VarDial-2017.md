##### Abstract
This paper describes the submission from the University of Helsinki to the shared task on cross-lingual dependency parsing at VarDial 2017. We present work on annotation projection and treebank translation that gave good results for all three target languages in the test set. In particular, Slovak seems to work well with information coming from the Czech treebank, which is in line with related work. The attachment scores for cross-lingual models even surpass the fully supervised models trained on the target language treebank. Croatian is the most difficult language in the test set and the improvements over the baseline are rather modest. Norwegian works best with information coming from Swedish whereas Danish contributes surprisingly little.

本文介绍了赫尔辛基大学提交给VarDial 2017的跨语言依赖分析的共享任务。我们介绍了关于注释投影和树库转换的工作，给测试集中的所有三种目标语言提供了良好的结果。特别是，斯洛伐克似乎与来自捷克树库的信息一致，符合相关的工作。跨语言模型的附件评分甚至超过了在目标语言树库上训练的完全监督模型。克罗地亚语是测试集中最困难的语言，对基线的改进相当有限。挪威的信息来自瑞典，而丹麦的信息却少得可怜。
