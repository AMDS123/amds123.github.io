##### Abstract
Nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF), a dimensionality reduction and factor analysis method, is a special case in which factor matrices have low-rank nonnegative constraints. Considering the stochastic learning in NMF, we specifically address the multiplicative update (MU) rule, which is the most popular, but which has slow convergence property. This present paper introduces on the stochastic MU rule a variance-reduced technique of stochastic gradient. Numerical comparisons suggest that our proposed algorithms robustly outperform state-of-the-art algorithms across different synthetic and real-world datasets.

##### Abstract (translated by Google)
非负矩阵分解（NMF）是一个特殊情况，其中因子矩阵具有低秩非负约束。考虑到NMF中的随机性学习，我们特别针对最流行，但收敛性较慢的乘法更新（MU）规则。本文介绍了随机MU规则随机梯度的方差减少技术。数值比较表明，我们提出的算法在不同的合成和现实世界的数据集上的稳健性优于最先进的算法。
