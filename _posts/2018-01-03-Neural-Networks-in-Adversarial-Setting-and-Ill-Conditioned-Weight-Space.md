##### Abstract
Recently, Neural networks have seen a huge surge in its adoption due to their ability to provide high accuracy on various tasks. On the other hand, the existence of adversarial examples have raised suspicions regarding the generalization capabilities of neural networks. In this work, we focus on the weight matrix learnt by the neural networks and hypothesize that ill conditioned weight matrix is one of the contributing factors in neural network's susceptibility towards adversarial examples. For ensuring that the learnt weight matrix's condition number remains sufficiently low, we suggest using orthogonal regularizer. We show that this indeed helps in increasing the adversarial accuracy on MNIST and F-MNIST datasets.

最近，神经网络由于能够在各种任务中提供高精度的能力而被大量采用。另一方面，敌对的例子的存在引起了人们对神经网络泛化能力的怀疑。在这项工作中，我们专注于由神经网络学习的权重矩阵，并假设病态权重矩阵是神经网络对对抗例子敏感性的因素之一。为了确保学习权重矩阵的条件数量保持足够低，我们建议使用正交正则化器。我们证明这确实有助于增加对MNIST和F-MNIST数据集的敌对准确性。
