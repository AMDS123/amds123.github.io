##### Abstract
With the increase of the nonlinearity and dimension, it is difficult for the present popular metamodeling techniques to construct reliable metamodels. To address this problem, Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is introduced to construct a highly accurate metamodel efficiently. Considering the inherent characteristics of the CNN, it is a potential modeling tool to handle highly nonlinear and dimensional problems (hundreds-dimensional problems) with the limited training samples. In order to evaluate the proposed CNN metamodel for hundreds-dimensional and strong nonlinear problems, CNN is compared with other metamodeling techniques. Furthermore, several high-dimensional analytical functions are also employed to test the CNN metamodel. Testing and comparisons confirm the efficiency and capability of the CNN metamodel for hundreds-dimensional and strong nonlinear problems. Moreover, the proposed CNN metamodel is also applied to IsoGeometric Analysis (IGA)-based optimization successfully.

随着非线性和维度的增加，目前流行的元模型技术很难构建可靠的元模型。为了解决这个问题，引入了卷积神经网络（CNN）来有效地构建高度准确的元模型。考虑到CNN的固有特性，它是一种潜在的建模工具，可以利用有限的训练样本处理高度非线性和维度问题（数百维问题）。为了评估所提出的用于数百维和强非线性问题的CNN元模型，将CNN与其他元模型技术进行比较。此外，还采用了几种高维分析函数来测试CNN元模型。测试和比较证实了CNN元模型对数百维和强非线性问题的效率和能力。此外，所提出的CNN元模型也成功应用于基于IsoGeometric Analysis（IGA）的优化。
