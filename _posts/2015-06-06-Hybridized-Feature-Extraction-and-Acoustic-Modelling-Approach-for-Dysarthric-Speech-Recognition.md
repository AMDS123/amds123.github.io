##### Abstract
Dysarthria is malfunctioning of motor speech caused by faintness in the human nervous system. It is characterized by the slurred speech along with physical impairment which restricts their communication and creates the lack of confidence and affects the lifestyle. This paper attempt to increase the efficiency of Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) system for unimpaired speech signal. It describes state of art of research into improving ASR for speakers with dysarthria by means of incorporated knowledge of their speech production. Hybridized approach for feature extraction and acoustic modelling technique along with evolutionary algorithm is proposed for increasing the efficiency of the overall system. Here number of feature vectors are varied and tested the system performance. It is observed that system performance is boosted by genetic algorithm. System with 16 acoustic features optimized with genetic algorithm has obtained highest recognition rate of 98.28% with training time of 5:30:17.

由于人体神经系统模糊，运动障碍引起的运动神经失调。其特点是言语不清，伴随身体损伤，限制交流，造成信心不足，影响生活方式。本文试图提高未受损语音信号的自动语音识别（ASR）系统的效率。它描述了通过结合语音产生的知识来改善构音障碍者的ASR的研究现状。提出了一种特征提取和声学建模技术与演化算法的混合方法，以提高整个系统的效率。这里特征向量的数量是多种多样的，并测试了系统的性能。可以看出，系统性能受到遗传算法的推动。采用遗传算法优化的16个声学特征的系统在训练时间为5:30:17的情况下获得了98.28％的最高识别率。
