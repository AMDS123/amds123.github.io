##### Abstract
Named entity recognition, and other information extraction tasks, frequently use linguistic features such as part of speech tags or chunkings. For languages where word boundaries are not readily identified in text, word segmentation is a key first step to generating features for an NER system. While using word boundary tags as features are helpful, the signals that aid in identifying these boundaries may provide richer information for an NER system. New state-of-the-art word segmentation systems use neural models to learn representations for predicting word boundaries. We show that these same representations, jointly trained with an NER system, yield significant improvements in NER for Chinese social media. In our experiments, jointly training NER and word segmentation with an LSTM-CRF model yields nearly 5% absolute improvement over previously published results.

命名实体识别和其他信息提取任务经常使用诸如词性标签或块的语言特征。对于文本中不容易识别单词边界的语言，分词是生成NER系统功能的关键第一步。尽管使用字边界标记作为特征是有帮助的，但是帮助识别这些边界的信号可以为NER系统提供更丰富的信息。新的最先进的分词系统使用神经模型来学习预测词边界的表示。我们发现，这些与NER系统联合培训的相同表示，对中国社交媒体的NER产生了显着的改善。在我们的实验中，用LSTM-CRF模型联合训练NER和分词比先前公布的结果产生近5％的绝对改善。
