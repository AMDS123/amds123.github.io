##### Abstract
Walter Skeat published his critical edition of William Langland's 14th century alliterative poem, Piers Plowman, in 1886. In preparation for this he located forty-five manuscripts, and to compare dialects, he published excerpts from each of these. This paper does three statistical analyses using these excerpts, each of which mimics a task he did in writing his critical edition. First, he combined multiple versions of a poetic line to create a best line, which is compared to the mean string that is computed by a generalization of the arithmetic mean that uses edit distance. Second, he claims that a certain subset of manuscripts varies little. This is quantified by computing a string variance, which is closely related to the above generalization of the mean. Third, he claims that the manuscripts fall into three groups, which is a clustering problem that is addressed by using edit distance. The overall goal is to develop methodology that would be of use to a literary critic.

##### Abstract (translated by Google)
沃尔特·斯凯特（Walter Skeat）于1886年出版了威廉·兰格兰（William Langland）14世纪的一首诗（Piers Plowman）的批评版。本文使用这些摘录做了三个统计分析，每个摘录都模仿了他在撰写评论版时所做的任务。首先，他组合了诗歌的多个版本来创建一条最佳线条，将其与通过使用编辑距离的算术平均值的泛化计算出的平均字符串进行比较。其次，他声称手稿的某个子集变化不大。这是通过计算一个字符串方差来量化的，这个方差与平均值的上述概括密切相关。第三，他声称手稿分为三类，这是一个使用编辑距离解决的聚类问题。总体目标是开发对文学评论家有用的方法论。
