##### Abstract
This work offers a design of a video surveillance system based on a soft biometric -- gait identification from MoCap data. The main focus is on two substantial issues of the video surveillance scenario: (1) the walkers do not cooperate in providing learning data to establish their identities and (2) the data are often noisy or incomplete. We show that only a few examples of human gait cycles are required to learn a projection of raw MoCap data onto a low-dimensional sub-space where the identities are well separable. Latent features learned by Maximum Margin Criterion (MMC) method discriminate better than any collection of geometric features. The MMC method is also highly robust to noisy data and works properly even with only a fraction of joints tracked. The overall workflow of the design is directly applicable for a day-to-day operation based on the available MoCap technology and algorithms for gait analysis. In the concept we introduce, a walker's identity is represented by a cluster of gait data collected at their incidents within the surveillance system: They are how they walk.

这项工作提供了一个基于MoCap数据的软生物识别步态识别视频监控系统的设计。主要关注视频监控场景的两个重要问题：（1）步行者不提供学习数据来建立他们的身份;（2）数据往往是嘈杂或不完整的。我们表明，只需要几个人类步态周期的例子来学习原始MoCap数据投影到身份可以很好分离的低维子空间上。通过最大裕度标准（MMC）方法学习的潜在特征比任何几何特征的集合都更好地区分。 MMC方法对噪声数据也非常稳健，即使只有一小部分关节被跟踪也能正常工作。基于现有的MoCap技术和步态分析算法，该设计的整个工作流程可直接应用于日常操作。在我们介绍的概念中，一个步行者的身份是由监视系统内事件收集的一组步态数据表示的：他们是如何行走的。
