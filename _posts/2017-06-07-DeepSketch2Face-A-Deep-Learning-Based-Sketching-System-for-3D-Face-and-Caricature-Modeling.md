##### Abstract
Face modeling has been paid much attention in the field of visual computing. There exist many scenarios, including cartoon characters, avatars for social media, 3D face caricatures as well as face-related art and design, where low-cost interactive face modeling is a popular approach especially among amateur users. In this paper, we propose a deep learning based sketching system for 3D face and caricature modeling. This system has a labor-efficient sketching interface, that allows the user to draw freehand imprecise yet expressive 2D lines representing the contours of facial features. A novel CNN based deep regression network is designed for inferring 3D face models from 2D sketches. Our network fuses both CNN and shape based features of the input sketch, and has two independent branches of fully connected layers generating independent subsets of coefficients for a bilinear face representation. Our system also supports gesture based interactions for users to further manipulate initial face models. Both user studies and numerical results indicate that our sketching system can help users create face models quickly and effectively. A significantly expanded face database with diverse identities, expressions and levels of exaggeration is constructed to promote further research and evaluation of face modeling techniques.

人脸建模在视觉计算领域备受关注。存在很多场景，包括卡通人物，社交媒体头像，3D人脸漫画以及与人脸相关的艺术设计，其中低成本的交互式人脸建模尤其是业余用户之间的流行方式。在本文中，我们提出了一个基于深度学习的三维人脸和漫画建模草图系统。该系统具有省力的草图界面，允许用户绘制手写不精确但具有表现力的二维线，表示面部特征的轮廓。一种新颖的基于CNN的深度回归网络被设计用于从二维草图推断三维人脸模型。我们的网络融合了CNN和输入草图的基于形状的特征，并且具有两个完全连接的层的独立分支，为双线性人脸表示生成独立的系数子集。我们的系统还支持用户进一步操纵初始人脸模型的基于手势的交互。用户研究和数值结果表明，我们的草图系统可以帮助用户快速有效地创建人脸模型。构建了一个具有不同身份，表情和夸张程度的显着扩展的人脸数据库，以促进人脸建模技术的进一步研究和评估。
