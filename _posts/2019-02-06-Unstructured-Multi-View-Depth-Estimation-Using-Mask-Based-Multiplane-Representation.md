##### Abstract
This paper presents a novel method, MaskMVS, to solve depth estimation for unstructured multi-view image-pose pairs. In the plane-sweep procedure, the depth planes are sampled by histogram matching that ensures covering the depth range of interest. Unlike other plane-sweep methods, we do not rely on a cost metric to explicitly build the cost volume, but instead infer a multiplane mask representation which regularizes the learning. Compared to many previous approaches, we show that our method is lightweight and generalizes well without requiring excessive training. We outperform the current state-of-the-art and show results on the sun3d, scenes11, MVS, and RGBD test data sets.
