##### Abstract
This paper introduces a deep-learning based efficient classifier for common dermatological conditions, aimed at people without easy access to skin specialists. We report approximately 80% accuracy, in a situation where primary care doctors have attained 57% success rate, according to recent literature. The rationale of its design is centered on deploying and updating it on handheld devices in near future. Dermatological diseases are common in every population and have a wide spectrum in severity. With a shortage of dermatological expertise being observed in several countries, machine learning solutions can augment medical services and advise regarding existence of common diseases. The paper implements supervised classification of nine distinct conditions which have high occurrence in East Asian countries. Our current attempt establishes that deep learning based techniques are viable avenues for preliminary information to aid patients.

本文介绍了一种基于深度学习的高效分类器，用于常见皮肤病症状，针对不易接触皮肤专家的人群。根据最近的文献，我们报告了大约80％的准确性，在初级保健医生成功率达到57％的情况下。其设计的基本原理是在不久的将来在手持设备上进行部署和更新。皮肤病在每个人群中都很常见，并且病情严重。由于一些国家的皮肤病学专业知识短缺，机器学习解决方案可以增强医疗服务并就常见疾病的存在提供咨询。本文对东亚国家发生率高的九个不同情况进行了监督分类。我们目前的尝试确立了基于深度学习的技术是初步信息帮助患者的可行途径。
