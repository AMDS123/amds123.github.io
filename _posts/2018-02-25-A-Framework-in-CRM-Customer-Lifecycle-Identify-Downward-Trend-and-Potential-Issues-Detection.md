##### Abstract
Customer retention is one of the primary goals in the area of customer relationship management. A mass of work exists in which machine learning models or business rules are established to predict churn. However, targeting users at an early stage when they start to show a downward trend is a better strategy. In downward trend prediction, the reasons why customers show a downward trend is of great interest in the industry as it helps the business to understand the pain points that customers suffer and to take early action to prevent them from churning. A commonly used method is to collect feedback from customers by either aggressively reaching out to them or by passively hearing from them. However, it is believed that there are a large number of customers who have unpleasant experiences and never speak out. In the literature, there is limited research work that provides a comprehensive and scientific approach to identify these "silent suffers". In this study, we propose a novel two-part framework: developing the downward prediction process and establishing the methodology to identify the reasons why customers are in the downward trend. In the first prediction part, we focus on predicting the downward trend, which is an earlier stage of the customer lifecycle compared to churn. In the second part, we propose an approach to figuring out the cause (of the downward trend) based on a causal inference method and semi-supervised learning. The proposed approach is capable of identifying potential silent sufferers. We take bad shopping experiences as inputs to develop the framework and validate it via a marketing A/B test in the real world. The test readout demonstrates the effectiveness of the framework by driving 88.5% incremental lift in purchase volume.

客户保留是客户关系管理领域的主要目标之一。大量的工作存在于建立机器学习模型或业务规则以预测客户流失。但是，在开始呈现下降趋势的早期阶段针对用户是更好的策略。在下降趋势预测中，客户呈现下降趋势的原因对该行业非常感兴趣，因为它有助于企业了解客户遭受的痛苦点并采取及时行动以防止他们搅动。一种常用的方法是通过积极接触他们或被动地从他们那里收集消息来收集客户的反馈意见。然而，相信有大量的客户有不愉快的经历并且从不说出来。在文献中，有限的研究工作提供了全面和科学的方法来识别这些“沉默的痛苦”。在这项研究中，我们提出了一个新颖的两部分框架：开发向下预测过程并建立方法来确定客户处于下降趋势的原因。在第一个预测部分，我们专注于预测下降趋势，这是客户生命周期的早期阶段，与流失相比。在第二部分中，我们提出了一种基于因果推理方法和半监督学习来确定（下降趋势）原因的方法。提议的方法能够识别潜在的无声患者。我们将糟糕的购物体验作为投入来开发框架并通过现实世界中的市场A / B测试进行验证。测试读数通过提高采购量的88.5％增量来证明该框架的有效性。
