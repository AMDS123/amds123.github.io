##### Abstract
This paper addresses the problem of automated vehicle tracking and recognition from aerial image sequences. Motivated by its successes in the existing literature focus on the use of linear appearance subspaces to describe multi-view object appearance and highlight the challenges involved in their application as a part of a practical system. A working solution which includes steps for data extraction and normalization is described. In experiments on real-world data the proposed methodology achieved promising results with a high correct recognition rate and few, meaningful errors (type II errors whereby genuinely similar targets are sometimes being confused with one another). Directions for future research and possible improvements of the proposed method are discussed.

本文针对航空影像序列中的自动车辆跟踪和识别问题。在现有文献的成功推动下，着重于使用线性外观子空间来描述多视图对象的外观，并强调作为实际系统的一部分应用中涉及的挑战。描述了包括用于数据提取和归一化的步骤的工作解决方案。在实际数据的实验中，所提出的方法取得了有希望的结果，具有高的正确识别率和很少的有意义的错误（类型II错误，其中真正相似的目标有时被相互混淆）。讨论了未来研究的方向和可能改进的方法。
