##### Abstract
In this paper, a model for classification of logos based on symbolic representation of features is presented. The proposed model makes use of global features of logo images such as color, texture, and shape features for classification. The logo images are broadly classified into three different classes, viz., logo image containing only text, an image with only symbol, and an image with both text and a symbol. In each class, the similar looking logo images are clustered using K-means clustering algorithm. The intra-cluster variations present in each cluster corresponding to each class are then preserved using symbolic interval data. Thus referenced logo images are represented in the form of interval data. A sample logo image is then classified using suitable symbolic classifier. For experimentation purpose, relatively large amount of color logo images is created consisting of 5044 logo images. The classification results are validated with the help of accuracy, precision, recall, F-measure, and time. To check the efficacy of the proposed model, the comparative analyses are given against the other models. The results show that the proposed model outperforms the other models with respect to time and F-measure.

本文提出了一种基于特征符号表示的逻辑分类模型。该模型利用标识图像的全局特征，如颜色，纹理和形状特征进行分类。标识图像大致分为三个不同的类别，即仅包含文本的标识图像，仅包含符号的图像以及包含文本和符号的图像。在每个类中，使用K均值聚类算法将相似的标识图像聚类。然后使用符号间隔数据保存与每个类对应的每个簇中存在的簇内变化。这样引用的标志图像以区间数据的形式表示。然后使用合适的符号分类器对样本标志图像进行分类。为了实验目的，创建包含5044个标志图像的相对大量的颜色标志图像。分类结果通过准确性，精度，召回率，F度量和时间来验证。为了检验提出的模型的有效性，对其他模型进行了比较分析。结果表明，该模型在时间和F-measure方面优于其他模型。
