##### Abstract
Recently, Attention-Gated Convolutional Neural Networks (AGCNNs) perform well on several essential sentence classification tasks and show robust performance in practical applications. However, AGCNNs are required to set many hyperparameters, and it is not known how sensitive the model's performance changes with them. In this paper, we conduct a sensitivity analysis on the effect of different hyperparameters s of AGCNNs, e.g., the kernel window size and the number of feature maps. Also, we investigate the effect of different combinations of hyperparameters settings on the model's performance to analyze to what extent different parameters settings contribute to AGCNNs' performance. Meanwhile, we draw practical advice from a wide range of empirical results. Through the sensitivity analysis experiment, we improve the hyperparameters settings of AGCNNs. Experiments show that our proposals achieve an average of 0.81% and 0.67% improvements on AGCNN-NLReLU-rand and AGCNN-SELU-rand, respectively; and an average of 0.47% and 0.45% improvements on AGCNN-NLReLU-static and AGCNN-SELU-static, respectively.
