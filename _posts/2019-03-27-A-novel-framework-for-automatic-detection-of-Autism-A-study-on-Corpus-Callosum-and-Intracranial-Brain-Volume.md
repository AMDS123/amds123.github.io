##### Abstract
Computer vision and machine learning are the linchpin of field of automation. The medicine industry has adopted numerous methods to discover the root causes of many diseases in order to automate detection process. But, the biomarkers of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) are still unknown, let alone automating its detection, due to intense connectivity of neurological pattern in brain. Studies from the neuroscience domain highlighted the fact that corpus callosum and intracranial brain volume holds significant information for detection of ASD. Such results and studies are not tested and verified by scientists working in the domain of computer vision / machine learning. Thus, in this study we have applied machine learning algorithms on features extracted from corpus callosum and intracranial brain volume data. Corpus callosum and intracranial brain volume data is obtained from s-MRI (structural Magnetic Resonance Imaging) data-set known as ABIDE (Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange). Our proposed framework for automatic detection of ASD showed potential of machine learning algorithms for development of neuroimaging data understanding and detection of ASD. Proposed framework enhanced achieved accuracy by calculating weights / importance of features extracted from corpus callosum and intracranial brain volume data.
