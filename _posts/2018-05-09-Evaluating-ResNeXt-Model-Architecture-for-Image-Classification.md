##### Abstract
In recent years, deep learning methods have been successfully applied to image classification tasks. Many such deep neural networks exist today that can easily differentiate cats from dogs. One such model is the ResNeXt model that uses a homogeneous, multi-branch architecture for image classification. This paper aims at implementing and evaluating the ResNeXt model architecture on subsets of the CIFAR-10 dataset. It also tweaks the original ResNeXt hyper-parameters such as cardinality, depth and base-width and compares the performance of the modified model with the original. Analysis of the experiments performed in this paper show that a slight decrease in depth or base-width does not affect the performance of the model much leading to comparable results.

近年来，深度学习方法已成功应用于图像分类任务。今天存在许多这样的深度神经网络，可以很容易区分猫和狗。 ResNeXt模型就是一种这样的模型，它使用了一种用于图像分类的同构多分支体系结构。本文旨在实施和评估CIFAR-10数据集子集上的ResNeXt模型体系结构。它还调整原始ResNeXt超参数，如基数，深度和基宽，并将修改后的模型与原始模型的性能进行比较。本文所做的实验分析表明，深度或基底宽度的略微减少不会影响模型的性能，从而导致可比较的结果。
