##### Abstract
Music genre recognition based on visual representation has been successfully explored over the last years. Recently, there has been increasing interest in attempting convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to achieve the task. However, most of existing methods employ the mature CNN structures proposed in image recognition without any modification, which results in the learning features that are not adequate for music genre classification. Faced with the challenge of this issue, we fully exploit the low-level information from spectrograms of audios and develop a novel CNN architecture in this paper. The proposed CNN architecture takes the long contextual information into considerations, which transfers more suitable information for the decision-making layer. Various experiments on several benchmark datasets, including GTZAN, Ballroom, and Extended Ballroom, have verified the excellent performances of the proposed neural network. Codes and model will be available at "ttps://github.com/CaifengLiu/music-genre-classification".
