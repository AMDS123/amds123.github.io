##### Abstract
Rice has been one of the staple foods that contribute significantly to human food supplies. Numerous rice varieties have been cultivated, imported, and exported worldwide. Different rice varieties could be mixed during rice production and trading. Rice impurities could damage the trust between rice importers and exporters, calling for the need to develop a rice variety inspection system. In this work, we develop a non-destructive rice variety classification system that benefits from the synergy between hyperspectral imaging and deep convolutional neural network (CNN). The proposed method uses a hyperspectral imaging system to simultaneously acquire complementary spatial and spectral information of rice seeds. The rice varieties are then determined from the acquired spatio-spectral data using a deep CNN. As opposed to several existing rice variety classification methods that require hand-engineered features, the proposed method automatically extracts features from the raw sensor data. As demonstrated using two types of rice datasets, the proposed method achieved up to 8% relative improvement in the classification accuracy compared to the commonly used classification methods based on support vector machines.

大米一直是对人类食品供应作出重大贡献的主食之一。许多水稻品种已经在全世界种植，进口和出口。水稻生产和贸易期间可能会混合不同的水稻品种。大米杂质可能会破坏大米进口商和出口商之间的信任，并呼吁开发一个大米品种检验系统。在这项工作中，我们开发了一个非破坏性的水稻品种分类系统，它受益于高光谱成像和深度卷积神经网络（CNN）之间的协同作用。该方法利用高光谱成像系统同时获取水稻种子的互补空间和光谱信息。然后使用深CNN从所获得的空间光谱数据确定水稻品种。与一些现有的需要手工设计的水稻品种分类方法相反，所提出的方法自动从原始传感器数据中提取特征。如使用两种类型的稻米数据集所证明的，与基于支持向量机的常用分类方法相比，所提出的方法在分类准确性方面相对提高了8％。
