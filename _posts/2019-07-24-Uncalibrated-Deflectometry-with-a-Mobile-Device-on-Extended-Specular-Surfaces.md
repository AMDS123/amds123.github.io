##### Abstract
We introduce a system and methods for the three-dimensional measurement of extended specular surfaces with high surface normal variations. Our system consists only of a mobile hand held device and exploits screen and front camera for Deflectometry-based surface measurements. We demonstrate high quality measurements without the need for an offline calibration procedure. In addition, we develop a multi-view technique to compensate for the small screen of a mobile device so that large surfaces can be densely reconstructed in their entirety. This work is a first step towards developing a self-calibrating Deflectometry procedure capable of taking 3D surface measurements of specular objects in the wild and accessible to users with little to no technical imaging experience.
