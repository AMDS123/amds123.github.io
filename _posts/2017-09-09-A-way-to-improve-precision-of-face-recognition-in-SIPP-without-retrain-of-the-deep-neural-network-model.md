##### Abstract
Although face recognition has been improved much as the development of Deep Neural Networks, SIPP(Single Image Per Person) problem in face recognition has not been better solved. In this paper, multiple methods will be introduced to improve the precision of SIPP face recognition without retrain of the DNN model. First, a modified SVD based method will be introduced to get more face images of one person in order to get more intra-class variations. Second, some more tricks will be introduced to help get the most similar person ID in a complex dataset, and some theoretical explain included to prove of why our tricks effective. Third, we would like to emphasize, no need to retrain of the DNN model and this would be easy to be extended in many applications without much efforts. We do some practical testing in competition of Msceleb challenge-2 2017 which was hold by Microsoft Research and finally we rank top-10. Great improvement of coverage from 13.39\% to 19.25\%, 29.94\%, 42.11\%, 47.52\% at precision P99(99\%) would be shown in this paper.

尽管随着深度神经网络的发展，人脸识别得到了很大的改善，但人脸识别中的SIPP（Single Image Per Person）问题还没有得到较好的解决。在本文中，将引入多种方法来提高SIPP人脸识别的精度，而无需DNN模型的重新训练。首先，将引入修改的基于SVD的方法来获取更多的人的面部图像，以获得更多的课堂内变化。其次，将会引入更多的技巧来帮助获取复杂数据集中最相似的人物ID，并且会给出一些理论解释来证明为什么我们的技巧是有效的。第三，我们想强调的是，不需要重新培训DNN模型，这在很多应用中很容易被扩展，而没有太多努力。我们在微软研究院举办的Msceleb challenge-2 2017竞赛中进行了一些实际测试，最后我们排名前十。本文将以精度P99（99 \％）为基础，将覆盖率从13.39％提高到19.25％，29.94％，42.11％，47.52％。
