##### Abstract
Connections between relations in relation extraction, which we call class ties, are common. In distantly supervised scenario, one entity tuple may have multiple relation facts. Exploiting class ties between relations of one entity tuple will be promising for distantly supervised relation extraction. However, previous models are not effective or ignore to model this property. In this work, to effectively leverage class ties, we propose to make joint relation extraction with a unified model that integrates convolutional neural network (CNN) with a general pairwise ranking framework, in which three novel ranking loss functions are introduced. Additionally, an effective method is presented to relieve the severe class imbalance problem from NR (not relation) for model training. Experiments on a widely used dataset show that leveraging class ties will enhance extraction and demonstrate the effectiveness of our model to learn class ties. Our model outperforms the baselines significantly, achieving state-of-the-art performance.

关系抽取中的关系之间的关系，我们称之为阶级关系，是常见的。在远程监督的情况下，一个实体元组可能有多个关系事实。利用一个实体元组关系之间的类关系将有望用于远程监督关系提取。但是，以前的模型无法有效或忽略模型此属性。在这项工作中，为了有效地利用类关系，我们提出用统一模型进行联合关系抽取，将卷积神经网络（CNN）与一般的成对排序框架相结合，引入三种新的排序损失函数。此外，还提出了一种有效的方法来缓解模型训练中NR（非关系）严重的类不平衡问题。广泛使用的数据集上的实验表明，利用类关系将增强提取，并展示我们的模型学习类关系的有效性。我们的模型显着优于基线，达到了最先进的性能。
