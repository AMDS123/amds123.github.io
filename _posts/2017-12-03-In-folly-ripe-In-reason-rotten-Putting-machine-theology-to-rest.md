##### Abstract
Computation has changed the world more than any previous expressions of knowledge. In its particular algorithmic embodiment, it offers a perspective, within which the digital computer (one of many possible) exercises a role reminiscent of theology. Since it is closed to meaning, algorithmic digital computation can at most mimic the creative aspects of life. AI, in the perspective of time, proved to be less an acronym for artificial intelligence and more of automating tasks associated with intelligence. The entire development led to the hypostatized role of the machine: outputting nothing else but reality, including that of the humanity that made the machine happen. The convergence machine called deep learning is only the latest form through which the deterministic theology of the machine claims more than what extremely effective data processing actually is. A new understanding of complexity, as well as the need to distinguish between the reactive nature of the artificial and the anticipatory nature of the living are suggested as practical responses to the challenges posed by machine theology.

##### Abstract (translated by Google)
计算已经改变了世界，而不是以前的任何知识表达。在其特定的算法实施例中，它提供了一个观点，数字计算机（许多可能的其中之一）在其中扮演一个让人想起神学的角色。由于它对意义是封闭的，所以算法数字计算最多可以模仿生活的创造性方面。人工智能从时间的角度来看，已经不再是人工智能的缩写，更多的是与智能相关的自动化任务。整个发展导致了机器的海员化作用：除了现实之外别无他物，包括使机器发生的人性化。称为深度学习的收敛机器仅仅是机器的确定性神学要求的最新形式，而不是实际上非常有效的数据处理。对于复杂性的新理解以及区分人工反应性和生活预期性的需要，被认为是对机器神学所带来挑战的实际应对。
