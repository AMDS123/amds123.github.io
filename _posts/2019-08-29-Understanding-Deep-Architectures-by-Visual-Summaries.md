##### Abstract
In deep learning, visualization techniques extract the salient patterns exploited by deep networks for image classification, focusing on single images; no effort has been spent in investigating whether these patterns are systematically related to precise semantic entities over multiple images belonging to a same class, thus failing to capture the very understanding of the image class the network has realized. This paper goes in this direction, presenting a visualization framework which produces a group of clusters or summaries, each one formed by crisp salient image regions focusing on a particular part that the network has exploited with high regularity to decide for a given class. The approach is based on a sparse optimization step providing sharp image saliency masks that are clustered together by means of a semantic flow similarity measure. The summaries communicate clearly what a network has exploited of a particular image class, and this is proved through automatic image tagging and with a user study. Beyond the deep network understanding, summaries are also useful for many quantitative reasons: their number is correlated with ability of a network to classify (more summaries, better performances), and they can be used to improve the classification accuracy of a network through summary-driven specializations.
