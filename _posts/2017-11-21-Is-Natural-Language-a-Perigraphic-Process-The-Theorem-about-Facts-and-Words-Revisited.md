##### Abstract
As we discuss, a stationary stochastic process is nonergodic when a random persistent topic can be detected in the infinite random text sampled from the process, whereas we call the process strongly nonergodic when an infinite sequence of independent random bits, called probabilistic facts, is needed to describe this topic completely. Replacing probabilistic facts with an algorithmically random sequence of bits, called algorithmic facts, we adapt this property back to ergodic processes. Subsequently, we call a process perigraphic if the number of algorithmic facts which can be inferred from a finite text sampled from the process grows like a power of the text length. We present a simple example of such a process. Moreover, we demonstrate an assertion which we call the theorem about facts and words. This proposition states that the number of probabilistic or algorithmic facts which can be inferred from a text drawn from a process must be roughly smaller than the number of distinct word-like strings detected in this text by means of the PPM compression algorithm. We also observe that the number of the word-like strings for a sample of plays by Shakespeare follows an empirical stepwise power law, in a stark contrast to Markov processes. Hence we suppose that natural language considered as a process is not only non-Markov but also perigraphic.

正如我们所讨论的那样，当一个随机持久话题可以在从过程中抽样的无限随机文本中被检测到时，一个平稳的随机过程是非遍历的，而当需要一个称为概率事实的无限序列的独立随机位时，我们称这个过程是非遍历的来完整地描述这个话题。用算法上随机的比特序列替换概率事实，称为算法事实，我们将这个属性改回遍历过程。随后，如果从过程中抽取的有限文本中推断出的算法事实的数量随着文本长度的增长而增长，我们称之为过程语言。我们给出一个这样一个过程的简单例子。此外，我们展示了一个我们称之为事实和话语定理的论断。这个命题指出，从一个过程中得出的文本中可以推断出的概率或算法事实的数量必须大大小于通过PPM压缩算法在本文中检测到的不同词类字符串的数量。我们还观察到，莎士比亚戏剧样本中的单词字符串的数量遵循经验的逐步幂律，与马尔可夫过程形成鲜明的对比。因此，我们假设被认为是一个过程的自然语言不仅是非马尔可夫过程，而且也是过程式的过程。
