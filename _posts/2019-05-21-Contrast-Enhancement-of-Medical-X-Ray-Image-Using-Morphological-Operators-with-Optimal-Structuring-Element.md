##### Abstract
To guide surgical and medical treatment X-ray images have been used by physicians in every modern healthcare organization and hospitals. Doctor's evaluation process and disease identification in the area of skeletal system can be performed in a faster and efficient way with the help of X-ray imaging technique as they can depict bone structure painlessly. This paper presents an efficient contrast enhancement technique using morphological operators which will help to visualize important bone segments and soft tissues more clearly. Top-hat and Bottom-hat transform are utilized to enhance the image where gradient magnitude value is calculated for automatically selecting the structuring element (SE) size. Experimental evaluation on different x-ray imaging databases shows the effectiveness of our method which also produces comparatively better output against some existing image enhancement techniques.
