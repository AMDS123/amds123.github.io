##### Abstract
Consensus formation is investigated for multi-agent systems in which agents' beliefs are both vague and uncertain. Vagueness is represented by a third truth state meaning \emph{borderline}. This is combined with a probabilistic model of uncertainty. A belief combination operator is then proposed which exploits borderline truth values to enable agents with conflicting beliefs to reach a compromise. A number of simulation experiments are carried out in which agents apply this operator in pairwise interactions, under the bounded confidence restriction that the two agents' beliefs must be sufficiently consistent with each other before agreement can be reached. As well as studying the consensus operator in isolation we also investigate scenarios in which agents are influenced either directly or indirectly by the state of the world. For the former we conduct simulations which combine consensus formation with belief updating based on evidence. For the latter we investigate the effect of assuming that the closer an agent's beliefs are to the truth the more visible they are in the consensus building process. In all cases applying the consensus operators results in the population converging to a single shared belief which is both crisp and certain. Furthermore, simulations which combine consensus formation with evidential updating converge faster to a shared opinion which is closer to the actual state of the world than those in which beliefs are only changed as a result of directly receiving new evidence. Finally, if agent interactions are guided by belief quality measured as similarity to the true state of the world, then applying the consensus operator alone results in the population converging to a high quality shared belief.

针对代理人的信念既模糊又不确定的多代理系统研究共识形成。模糊性由第三个真实状态表示\ emph {borderline}。这与不确定性的概率模型相结合。然后提出一个信仰组合算子，利用边界真值来使具有冲突信念的代理人达成妥协。进行了许多仿真实验，其中代理人在成对的相互作用中应用这个算子，在有约束的置信限制下，两个代理人的信念在达成一致之前必须彼此充分一致。除了单独研究共识运算符外，我们还研究代理程序直接或间接受世界状况影响的情景。对于前者，我们进行模拟，结合共识的形成与基于证据的信念更新。对于后者，我们调查假设代理人的信念与真相越接近共识建立过程越明显的效果。在所有使用共识运算符的情况下，都会导致人口聚合到一个既清晰又确定的共享信念。此外，将共识形成与证据更新相结合的模拟更快地收敛于与世界实际情况更接近的共同观点，而不是直接接受新证据而改变信仰的共同观点。最后，如果以信任质量为指导，如果信任质量与世界的真实状态相似，那么仅仅运用共识算子就会导致人口收敛到高质量的共同信念。
