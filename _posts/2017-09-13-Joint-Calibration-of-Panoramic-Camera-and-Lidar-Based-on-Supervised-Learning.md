##### Abstract
In view of contemporary panoramic camera-laser scanner system, the traditional calibration method is not suitable for panoramic cameras whose imaging model is extremely nonlinear. The method based on statistical optimization has the disadvantage that the requirement of the number of laser scanner's channels is relatively high. Calibration equipments with extreme accuracy for panoramic camera-laser scanner system are costly. Facing all these in the calibration of panoramic camera-laser scanner system, a method based on supervised learning is proposed. Firstly, corresponding feature points of panoramic images and point clouds are gained to generate the training dataset by designing a round calibration object. Furthermore, the traditional calibration problem is transformed into a multiple nonlinear regression optimization problem by designing a supervised learning network with preprocessing of the panoramic imaging model. Back propagation algorithm is utilized to regress the rotation and translation matrix with high accuracy. Experimental results show that this method can quickly regress the calibration parameters and the accuracy is better than the traditional calibration method and the method based on statistical optimization. The calibration accuracy of this method is really high, and it is more highly-automated.

针对现代全景相机激光扫描仪系统，传统的校准方法不适用于成像模型非常非线性的全景相机。基于统计优化的方法存在激光扫描仪通道数量要求较高的缺点。用于全景相机激光扫描仪系统的极其精确的校准设备是昂贵的。面对全景相机激光扫描系统的校准，提出了一种基于监督学习的方法。首先，通过设计一个圆形校准对象，获得全景图像和点云对应的特征点，生成训练数据集。此外，通过设计一个有全景成像模型预处理的监督学习网络，将传统的校准问题转化为多元非线性回归优化问题。利用反向传播算法对旋转和平移矩阵进行高精度的回归。实验结果表明，该方法能够快速回归校准参数，精度优于传统校准方法和基于统计优化的方法。这种方法的校准精度非常高，而且自动化程度更高。
