##### Abstract
According to the WHO, Cerebrovascular Stroke, or CS, is the second largest cause of death worldwide. Current diagnosis of CS relies on labor and cost intensive neuroimaging techniques, unsuitable for areas with inadequate access to quality medical facilities. Thus, there is a great need for an efficient diagnosis alternative. StrokeSave is a platform for users to self-diagnose for prevalence to stroke. The mobile app is continuously updated with heart rate, blood pressure, and blood oxygen data from sensors on the patient wrist. Once these measurements reach a threshold for possible stroke, the patient takes facial images and vocal recordings to screen for paralysis attributed to stroke. A custom designed lens attached to a phone's camera then takes retinal images for the deep learning model to classify based on presence of retinopathy and sends a comprehensive diagnosis. The deep learning model, which consists of a RNN trained on 100 voice slurred audio files, a SVM trained on 410 vascular data points, and a CNN trained on 520 retinopathy images, achieved a holistic accuracy of 95.0 percent when validated on 327 samples. This value exceeds that of clinical examination accuracy, which is around 40 to 89 percent, further demonstrating the vital utility of such a medical device. Through this automated platform, users receive efficient, highly accurate diagnosis without professional medical assistance, revolutionizing medical diagnosis of CS and potentially saving millions of lives.
