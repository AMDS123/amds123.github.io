##### Abstract
Answer Set Programming (ASP) is one of the major declarative programming paradigms in the area of logic programming and non-monotonic reasoning. Despite that ASP features a simple syntax and an intuitive semantics, errors are common during the development of ASP programs. In this paper we propose a novel debugging approach allowing for interactive localization of bugs in non-ground programs. The new approach points the user directly to a set of non-ground rules involved in the bug, which might be refined (up to the point in which the bug is easily identified) by asking the programmer a sequence of questions on an expected answer set. The approach has been implemented on top of the ASP solver WASP. The resulting debugger has been complemented by a user-friendly graphical interface, and integrated in ASPIDE, a rich IDE for answer set programs. In addition, an empirical analysis shows that the new debugger is not affected by the grounding blowup limiting the application of previous approaches based on meta-programming. Under consideration in Theory and Practice of Logic Programming (TPLP).

答案集编程（ASP）是逻辑编程和非单调推理领域的主要声明性编程范例之一。尽管ASP具有简单的语法和直观的语义，但在ASP程序的开发过程中，错误很常见。在本文中，我们提出了一种新颖的调试方法，允许在非地面程序中交互式定位错误。新方法将用户直接指向错误中涉及的一组非基础规则，通过向程序员询问关于预期答案集的一系列问题，可以对其进行细化（直到容易识别错误的点）。 。该方法已在ASP解算器WASP之上实现。最终的调试器由用户友好的图形界面补充，并集成在ASPIDE中，这是一个用于答案集程序的丰富IDE。此外，实证分析表明，新的调试器不受基于元编程限制先前方法应用的接地爆破的影响。正在考虑逻辑规划理论与实践（TPLP）。
