##### Abstract
Human activity recognition (HAR) has become a popular topic in research because of its wide application. With the development of deep learning, new ideas have appeared to address HAR problems. Here, a deep network architecture using residual bidirectional long short-term memory (LSTM) cells is proposed. The advantages of the new network include that a bidirectional connection can concatenate the positive time direction (forward state) and the negative time direction (backward state). Second, residual connections between stacked cells act as highways for gradients, which can pass underlying information directly to the upper layer, effectively avoiding the gradient vanishing problem. Generally, the proposed network shows improvements on both the temporal (using bidirectional cells) and the spatial (residual connections stacked deeply) dimensions, aiming to enhance the recognition rate. When tested with the Opportunity data set and the public domain UCI data set, the accuracy was increased by 4.78% and 3.68%, respectively, compared with previously reported results. Finally, the confusion matrix of the public domain UCI data set was analyzed.

人类活动识别（HAR）由于其广泛的应用而成为研究的热门话题。随着深度学习的发展，出现了新的想法来解决HAR问题。在这里，提出了一种使用残余双向长期短期记忆（LSTM）单元的深层网络架构。新网络的优点包括：双向连接可以连接正向时间方向（正向状态）和负向时间方向（反向状态）。其次，堆叠单元之间的剩余连接作为梯度的高速公路，它可以将底层信息直接传递到上层，有效地避免了梯度消失问题。一般而言，所提出的网络在时间（使用双向小区）和空间（深度堆叠的深度连接）方面显示出改善，以提高识别率。当使用机会数据集和公共领域UCI数据集进行测试时，与之前报告的结果相比，准确性分别提高了4.78％和3.68％。最后分析了公共领域UCI数据集的混淆矩阵。
