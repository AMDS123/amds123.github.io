##### Abstract
Recently several end-to-end speaker verification systems based on deep neural networks (DNNs) have been proposed. These systems have been proven to be competitive for text-dependent tasks as well as for text-independent tasks with short utterances. However, for text-independent tasks with longer utterances, end-to-end systems are still outperformed by standard i-vector + PLDA systems. In this work, we develop an end-to-end speaker verification system that is initialized to mimic an i-vector + PLDA baseline. The system is then further trained in an end-to-end manner but regularized so that it does not deviate too far from the initial system. In this way we mitigate overfitting which normally limits the performance of end-to-end systems. The proposed system outperforms the i-vector + PLDA baseline on both long and short duration utterances.

最近已经提出了几个基于深度神经网络（DNN）的端到端说话者验证系统。已经证明这些系统对于依赖于文本的任务是有竞争力的，并且对于短文本而言是独立于文本的任务。然而，对于具有较长话语的与文本无关的任务来说，端到端系统仍然优于标准的i-vector + PLDA系统。在这项工作中，我们开发了一个端到端的说话人验证系统，该系统初始化为模拟i向量+ PLDA基线。然后，系统以端到端的方式进一步训练，但是正规化，使其不会偏离最初的系统。通过这种方式，我们可以减轻通常会限制端到端系统性能的过度拟合。所提出的系统在长期和短期话语上优于i矢量+ PLDA基线。
