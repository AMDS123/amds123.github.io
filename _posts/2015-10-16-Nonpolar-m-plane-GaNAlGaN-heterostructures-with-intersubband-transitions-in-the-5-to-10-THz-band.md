##### Abstract
This paper assesses intersubband transitions in the 1 to 10 THz frequency range in nonpolar m-plane GaN/AlGaN multi-quantum-wells deposited on free-standing semi-insulating GaN substrates. The quantum wells were designed to contain two confined electronic levels, decoupled from the neighboring wells. Structural analysis reveals flat and regular quantum wells in the two perpendicular inplane directions, with high-resolution images showing inhomogeneities of the Al composition in the barriers along the growth axis. We do not observe extended structural defects introduced by the epitaxial process. Low-temperature intersubband absorption from 1.5 to 9 THz is demonstrated, covering part of the 7 to 10 THz band forbidden to GaAs-based technologies.
