##### Abstract
The problem of minimization of the number of measurements needed for digital image acquisition and reconstruction with a given accuracy is addressed. Basics of the sampling theory are outlined to show that the lower bound of signal sampling rate sufficient for signal reconstruction with a given accuracy is equal to the spectrum sparsity of the signal sparse approximation that has this accuracy. The capability of Compressed Sensing of reconstruction of signals sampled with aliasing is demystified using a simple and intuitive model and limitations of this capability are discussed. It is revealed that the Compressed Sensing approach advanced as a solution to the sampling rate minimization problem is far from reaching the sampling rate theoretical minimum. A method of image Arbitrary Sampling and Bounded Spectrum Reconstruction (ASBSR-method) is described that allows to draw near the image sampling rate theoretical minimum. Presented and discussed are also results of experimental verification of the ASBSR-method and its possible applicability extensions to solving various under-determined inverse problems such as color image demosaicing, image in-painting, image reconstruction from their sparsely sampled or decimated projections, image reconstruction from module of its Fourier spectrum and image reconstruction from its sparse samples in Fourier domain

解决了以给定精度对数字图像采集和重建所需的测量次数最小化的问题。抽样理论的基本概述表明，给定精度的信号重构足够的信号采样率的下限等于具有该精度的信号稀疏近似的谱稀疏度。采用简单直观的模型揭示了混叠采样信号重构的压缩感知能力，并讨论了这种能力的局限性。揭示了压缩感知方法的进步，因为采样率最小化问题的解决方案远未达到采样率理论最小值。描述了图像任意采样和有界频谱重建（ASBSR-method）的方法，其允许在图像采样率理论最小值附近绘制图像。提出和讨论的也是ASBSR方法的实验验证的结果，以及其可能的适用性扩展，以解决诸如彩色图像去马赛克，图像在绘，从其稀疏采样或抽取投影的图像重建，图像重建从它的傅立叶谱模块和从其在傅立叶域中的稀疏样本重建图像
