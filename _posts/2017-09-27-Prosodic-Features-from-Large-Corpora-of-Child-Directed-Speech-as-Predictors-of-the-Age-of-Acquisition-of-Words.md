##### Abstract
The impressive ability of children to acquire language is a widely studied phenomenon, and the factors influencing the pace and patterns of word learning remains a subject of active research. Although many models predicting the age of acquisition of words have been proposed, little emphasis has been directed to the raw input children achieve. In this work we present a comparatively large-scale multi-modal corpus of prosody-text aligned child directed speech. Our corpus contains automatically extracted word-level prosodic features, and we investigate the utility of this information as predictors of age of acquisition. We show that prosody features boost predictive power in a regularized regression, and demonstrate their utility in the context of a multi-modal factorized language models trained and tested on child-directed speech.

##### Abstract (translated by Google)
儿童学习语言的能力令人印象深刻，是一个被广泛研究的现象，影响词汇学习速度和模式的因素仍然是一个值得研究的课题。尽管已经提出了许多预测词汇习得年龄的模型，但是很少强调针对原始投入的儿童实现的目标。在这项工作中，我们提出了一个比较大规模的多音韵律文本语料齐整的儿童导向的语音语料库。我们的语料库包含自动提取的单词级韵律特征，我们调查此信息的实用性作为获取年龄的预测因子。我们表明，韵律特征提高了正则化回归的预测能力，并且证明了它们在多模式因式分解语言模型的情况下的实用性。
