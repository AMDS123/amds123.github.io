##### Abstract
Negative Dark Electric Matter Objects, daemons, have been detected by means of ZnS(Ag) scintillator screens. These objects are apparently relic elementary Planckian black holes. The scintillations in ZnS(Ag) are excited by electrons and nucleons ejected as the daemon captures a nucleus of Zn (or S). By catalyzing the decay of protons in the remainder of the nucleus, the daemon becomes capable of capturing a new nucleus, and so on. The time elapsed between successive captures (scintillations) is used to estimate the daemon velocity and the proton decay time (~1 microsec). The flux of daemons with velocities from ~5 to ~30 km/s is ~10-9 cm-2s-1 and varies with a period of 0.5 yr. This could indicate a preferred direction of the flux, which is a result of the Sun's moving relative to daemons in the Galactic disk and of their capture into helio- and geocentric orbits. Daemons crowd at the centres of the Earth, the Sun, and the Galaxy, where they catalyze proton decay, a process capable of accounting from a common standpoint a variety of observations and phenomena unexplained heretofore.
