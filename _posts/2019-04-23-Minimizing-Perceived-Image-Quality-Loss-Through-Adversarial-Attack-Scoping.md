##### Abstract
Neural networks are now actively being used for computer vision tasks in security critical areas such as robotics, face recognition, autonomous vehicles yet their safety is under question after the discovery of adversarial attacks. In this paper we develop simplified adversarial attack algorithms based on a scoping idea, which enables execution of fast adversarial attacks that minimize structural image quality (SSIM) loss, allows performing efficient transfer attacks with low target inference network call count and opens a possibility of an attack using pen-only drawings on a paper for the MNIST handwritten digit dataset. The presented adversarial attack analysis and the idea of attack scoping can be easily expanded to different datasets, thus making the paper's results applicable to a wide range of practical tasks.
