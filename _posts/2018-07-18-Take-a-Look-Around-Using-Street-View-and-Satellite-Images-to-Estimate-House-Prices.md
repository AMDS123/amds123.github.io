##### Abstract
When an individual purchases a home, they simultaneously purchase its structural features, its accessibility to work, and the neighborhood amenities. Some amenities, such as air quality, are measurable whilst others, such as the prestige or the visual impression of a neighborhood, are difficult to quantify. Despite the well-known impacts intangible housing features have on house prices, limited attention has been given to systematically quantifying these difficult to measure amenities. Two issues have lead to this neglect. Not only do few quantitative methods exist that can measure the urban environment, but that the collection of such data is both costly and subjective. We show that street image and satellite image data can capture these urban qualities and improve the estimation of house prices. We propose a pipeline that uses a deep neural network model to automatically extract visual features from images to estimate house prices in London, UK. We make use of traditional housing features such as age, size and accessibility as well as visual features from Google Street View images and Bing aerial images in estimating the house price model. We find encouraging results where learning to characterize the urban quality of a neighborhood improves house price prediction, even when generalizing to previously unseen London boroughs. We explore the use of non-linear vs. linear methods to fuse these cues with conventional models of house pricing, and show how the interpretability of linear models allows us to directly extract the visual desirability of neighborhoods as proxy variables that are both of interest in their own right, and could be used as inputs to other econometric methods. This is particularly valuable as once the network has been trained with the training data, it can be applied elsewhere, allowing us to generate vivid dense maps of the desirability of London streets.

当一个人购买房屋时，他们同时购买其结构特征，工作的可及性和邻里设施。一些设施，例如空气质量，是可测量的，而其他设施，例如邻居的声望或视觉印象，难以量化。尽管无形住房特征对房价有众所周知的影响，但有限的注意力是系统地量化这些难以衡量的设施。两个问题导致了这种忽视。不仅存在很少能够测量城市环境的定量方法，而且这些数据的收集既昂贵又主观。我们表明街道图像和卫星图像数据可以捕捉这些城市品质并改善房价估算。我们提出了一种管道，它使用深度神经网络模型从图像中自动提取视觉特征，以估算英国伦敦的房价。我们利用传统的住房功能，如年龄，大小和可访问性，以及谷歌街景图像和Bing航拍图像的视觉特征来估算房价模型。我们发现令人鼓舞的结果是，学习如何表征邻里的城市质量可以改善房价预测，即使在推广到以前看不见的伦敦自治市镇时也是如此。我们探索使用非线性与线性方法将这些线索融合到传统的房屋定价模型中，并展示线性模型的可解释性如何允许我们直接提取邻域的视觉满意度作为代理变量。他们自己的权利，可以作为其他计量经济学方法的输入。这一点特别有价值，因为一旦网络接受了训练数据的训练，它就可以应用到其他地方，这使我们能够生成伦敦街道的可取性的生动密集地图。
