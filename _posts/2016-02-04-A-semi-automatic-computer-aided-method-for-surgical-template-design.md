##### Abstract
This paper presents a generalized integrated framework of semi-automatic surgical template design. Several algorithms were implemented including the mesh segmentation, offset surface generation, collision detection, ruled surface generation, etc., and a special software named TemDesigner was developed. With a simple user interface, a customized template can be semi- automatically designed according to the preoperative plan. Firstly, mesh segmentation with signed scalar of vertex is utilized to partition the inner surface from the input surface mesh based on the indicated point loop. Then, the offset surface of the inner surface is obtained through contouring the distance field of the inner surface, and segmented to generate the outer surface. Ruled surface is employed to connect inner and outer surfaces. Finally, drilling tubes are generated according to the preoperative plan through collision detection and merging. It has been applied to the template design for various kinds of surgeries, including oral implantology, cervical pedicle screw insertion, iliosacral screw insertion and osteotomy, demonstrating the efficiency, functionality and generality of our method.

##### Abstract (translated by Google)
本文提出了一个半自动手术模板设计的广义综合框架。实现了网格分割，偏移曲面生成，碰撞检测，直纹面生成等几种算法，并开发了一个名为TemDesigner的专用软件。通过一个简单的用户界面，一个定制的模板可以根据术前计划进行半自动设计。首先，利用顶点的带符号标量的网格分割，根据指示的点循环，将输入表面网格的内表面进行分割。然后，通过对内表面的距离场进行轮廓处理来获得内表面的偏移表面，并且分割以产生外表面。直纹面用于连接内外表面。最后，根据术前计划，通过碰撞检测和合并生成钻管。应用于口腔种植，颈椎椎弓根螺钉置入，髂骨螺钉插入，截骨等多种手术的模板设计，展示了本方法的有效性，功能性和通用性。
