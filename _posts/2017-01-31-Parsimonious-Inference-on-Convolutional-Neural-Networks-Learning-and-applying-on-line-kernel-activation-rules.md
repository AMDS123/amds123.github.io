##### Abstract
A new, radical CNN design approach is presented in this paper, considering the reduction of the total computational load during inference. This is achieved by a new holistic intervention on both the CNN architecture and the training procedure, which targets to the parsimonious inference by learning to exploit or remove the redundant capacity of a CNN architecture. This is accomplished, by the introduction of a new structural element that can be inserted as an add-on to any contemporary CNN architecture, whilst preserving or even improving its recognition accuracy. Our approach formulates a systematic and data-driven method for developing CNNs that are trained to eventually change size and form in real-time during inference, targeting to the smaller possible computational footprint. Results are provided for the optimal implementation on a few modern, high-end mobile computing platforms indicating a significant speed-up of up to x3 times.

本文提出了一种新的激进的CNN设计方法，考虑到推理过程中总计算量的减少。这是通过对CNN体系结构和训练过程进行全新的整体干预来实现的，其目的在于通过学习利用或消除CNN体系结构的冗余能力来进行简洁推理。这是通过引入一个新的结构元素来实现的，这个元素可以被插入到任何当代的CNN架构中，同时保留甚至提高识别的准确性。我们的方法制定了一个系统的和数据驱动的方法来开发CNNs，经过训练最终能够在推理过程中实时改变规模和形式，以更小的计算空间为目标。结果提供了在几个现代高端移动计算平台上的最佳实现，表明显着加速达x3倍。
