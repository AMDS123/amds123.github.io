##### Abstract
Omnidirectional (360{\deg}) video has got quite popular because it provides a highly immersive viewing experience. For computer vision algorithms, it poses several challenges, like the special (equirectangular) projection commonly employed and the huge image size. In this work, we give a high-level overview of these challenges and outline strategies how to adapt computer vision algorithm for the specifics of omnidirectional video.
