##### Abstract
Specialized dictionaries are used to understand concepts in specific domains, especially where those concepts are not part of the general vocabulary, or having meanings that differ from ordinary languages. The first step in creating a specialized dictionary involves detecting the characteristic vocabulary of the domain in question. Classical methods for detecting this vocabulary involve gathering a domain corpus, calculating statistics on the terms found there, and then comparing these statistics to a background or general language corpus. Terms which are found significantly more often in the specialized corpus than in the background corpus are candidates for the characteristic vocabulary of the domain. Here we present two tools, a directed crawler, and a distributional semantics package, that can be used together, circumventing the need of a background corpus. Both tools are available on the web.

专业词典被用来理解特定领域的概念，特别是那些概念不是一般词汇的一部分，或者含义与普通语言不同。创建专业词典的第一步涉及检测有问题的领域的特征词汇。检测这个词汇表的经典方法包括收集域语料库，计算在那里找到的术语的统计量，然后将这些统计量与背景或通用语言语料库进行比较。在专业语料库中比在背景语料库中显着更频繁地找到的术语是该领域特征词汇表的候选词。在这里，我们提出了两个工具，一个定向爬虫和一个分布式语义包，可以一起使用，绕过背景语料库的需要。这两个工具都可以在网上找到。
