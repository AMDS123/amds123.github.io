##### Abstract
Robot-assisted deployment of fenestrated stent grafts in Fenestrated Endovascular Aortic Repair (FEVAR) requires accurate geometrical alignment. Currently, this process is guided by 2D fluoroscopy, which is uninformative and error prone. In this paper, a real-time framework is proposed to instantiate the 3D shape of a fenestrated stent graft based on only a single low-dose 2D fluoroscopic image. Firstly, the fenestrated stent graft was placed with markers. Secondly, the 3D pose of each stent segment was instantiated by the RPnP (Robust Perspective-n-Point) method. Thirdly, the 3D shape of the whole stent graft was instantiated via graft gap interpolation. Focal-Unet was proposed to segment the markers from 2D fluoroscopic images to achieve semi-automatic marker detection. The proposed framework was validated on five patient-specific 3D printed phantoms of aortic aneurysms and three stent grafts with new marker placements, showing an average distance error of 1-3mm and an average angle error of 4 degree.

机器人辅助部署fenestrated血管内主动脉修复（FEVAR）fenestrated支架移植需要准确的几何对齐。目前，这个过程是由二维荧光透视引导的，这是无意义的和容易出错的。本文提出了一种实时框架，仅基于一个单一的低剂量二维荧光透视图像实例化开窗式支架植入物的三维形状。首先，带有标记的开窗式支架植入物。其次，通过RPnP（Robust Perspective-n-Point）方法对每个支架段的三维姿态进行实例化。第三，通过移植间隙插值实例化整个覆膜支架的三维形态。 Focal-Unet被提议从2D荧光图像分割标记以实现半自动标记检测。所提出的框架在5个患者特异性3D打印的主动脉瘤模型和3个具有新标记位置的支架移植物上进行验证，显示平均距离误差为1-3mm，平均角度误差为4度。
