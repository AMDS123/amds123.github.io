##### Abstract
This paper continues the research that considers a new cognitive model. In particular, it considers the neural binding structure of an earlier paper. To help with this, the paper describes some new methods in the areas of image processing and high-level behaviour simulation. The work is all based on earlier research by the author and the new additions are intended to fit in with the overall design. For image processing, a grid-like structure is used with full linking'. Each cell in the classifier grid stores a list of all other cells it gets associated with and this is used as the learned image that new input is compared to. For the behaviour metric, a new prediction equation is suggested, as part of a simulation, that uses feedback and history to dynamically determine its course of action. While the new methods are from widely different topics, both can be compared with the binary-analog type of interface that is the main focus of the paper. It is suggested that the simplest of linking between a tree and ensemble can explain neural binding and variable signal strengths.

本文继续研究考虑一种新的认知模型。特别是，它考虑了早期论文的神经结合结构。为了解决这个问题，本文介绍了图像处理和高级行为仿真领域的一些新方法。这项工作全部基于作者先前的研究，并且新增加的内容旨在与整体设计相适应。对于图像处理，使用具有完全链接的网格状结构'。分类器网格中的每个单元存储与其关联的所有其他单元的列表，并将其用作与新输入进行比较的学习图像。对于行为度量，建议使用新的预测方程作为模拟的一部分，该方程使用反馈和历史来动态确定其行为过程。虽然新方法来自广泛不同的主题，但都可以与本文主要关注的二进制模拟类型接口进行比较。建议在树和集合之间最简单的连接可以解释神经结合和可变信号强度。
