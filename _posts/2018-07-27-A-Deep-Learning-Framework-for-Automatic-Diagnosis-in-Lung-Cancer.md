##### Abstract
We developed a deep learning framework that helps to automatically identify and segment lung cancer areas in patients' tissue specimens. The study was based on a cohort of lung cancer patients operated at the Uppsala University Hospital. The tissues were reviewed by lung pathologists and then the cores were compiled to tissue micro-arrays (TMAs). For experiments, hematoxylin-eosin stained slides from 712 patients were scanned and then manually annotated. Then these scans and annotations were used to train segmentation models of the developed framework. The performance of the developed deep learning framework was evaluated on fully annotated TMA cores from 178 patients reaching pixel-wise precision of 0.80 and recall of 0.86. Finally, publicly available Stanford TMA cores were used to demonstrate high performance of the framework qualitatively.

我们开发了一个深度学习框架，有助于自动识别和分割患者组织标本中的肺癌区域。该研究基于乌普萨拉大学医院的一组肺癌患者。肺病理学家对组织进行评估，然后将核心编译成组织微阵列（TMA）。对于实验，扫描来自712名患者的苏木精 - 伊红染色的载玻片，然后手动注释。然后，这些扫描和注释用于训练开发框架的分割模型。开发的深度学习框架的性能在178名患者的完全注释的TMA核心上进行评估，达到像素精度为0.80，召回率为0.86。最后，公开可用的斯坦福TMA核心用于定性地展示框架的高性能。
