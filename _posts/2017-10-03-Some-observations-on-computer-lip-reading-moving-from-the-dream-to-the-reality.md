##### Abstract
In the quest for greater computer lip-reading performance there are a number of tacit assumptions which are either present in the datasets (high resolution for example) or in the methods (recognition of spoken visual units called visemes for example). Here we review these and other assumptions and show the surprising result that computer lip-reading is not heavily constrained by video resolution, pose, lighting and other practical factors. However, the working assumption that visemes, which are the visual equivalent of phonemes, are the best unit for recognition does need further examination. We conclude that visemes, which were defined over a century ago, are unlikely to be optimal for a modern computer lip-reading system.

为了获得更好的电脑读音性能，在数据集中（例如高分辨率）或者在方法中（例如称为visemes的口头视觉单元的识别），存在许多默认的假设。在这里，我们回顾这些和其他的假设，并显示出令人惊讶的结果，电脑唇读不是由视频分辨率，姿势，照明和其他实际因素严重制约。然而，视觉等同于音素的工作假设是最好的识别单位，需要进一步的检验。我们的结论是，在一个世纪以前定义的视觉效果不太可能是现代计算机唇读系统的最佳选择。
