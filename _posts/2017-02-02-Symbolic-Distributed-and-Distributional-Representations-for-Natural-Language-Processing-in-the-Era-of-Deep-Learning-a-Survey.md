##### Abstract
Natural language and symbols are intimately correlated. Recent advances in machine learning (ML) and in natural language processing (NLP) seem to contradict the above intuition: symbols are fading away, erased by vectors or tensors called distributed and distributional representations. However, there is a strict link between distributed/distributional representations and symbols, being the first an approximation of the second. A clearer understanding of the strict link between distributed/distributional representations and symbols will certainly lead to radically new deep learning networks. In this paper we make a survey that aims to draw the link between symbolic representations and distributed/distributional representations. This is the right time to revitalize the area of interpreting how symbols are represented inside neural networks.

##### Abstract (translated by Google)
自然语言和符号密切相关。机器学习（ML）和自然语言处理（NLP）方面的最新进展似乎与上述直觉相矛盾：符号消失，被称为分布和分布表示的向量或张量擦除。然而，分布式/分布式表征与符号之间存在着严格的联系，是第二个近似的第一个。对分布式/分布式表征和符号之间的严格联系的更清楚的理解必将导致全新的深度学习网络。在本文中，我们进行一项调查，旨在绘制符号表示与分布式/分布式表示之间的联系。现在是振兴神经网络中符号代表的领域的正确时机。
