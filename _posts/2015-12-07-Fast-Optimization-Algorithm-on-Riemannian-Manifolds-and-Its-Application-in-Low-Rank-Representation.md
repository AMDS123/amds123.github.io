##### Abstract
The paper addresses the problem of optimizing a class of composite functions on Riemannian manifolds and a new first order optimization algorithm (FOA) with a fast convergence rate is proposed. Through the theoretical analysis for FOA, it has been proved that the algorithm has quadratic convergence. The experiments in the matrix completion task show that FOA has better performance than other first order optimization methods on Riemannian manifolds. A fast subspace pursuit method based on FOA is proposed to solve the low-rank representation model based on augmented Lagrange method on the low rank matrix variety. Experimental results on synthetic and real data sets are presented to demonstrate that both FOA and SP-RPRG(ALM) can achieve superior performance in terms of faster convergence and higher accuracy.

针对黎曼流形上一类复合函数的优化问题，提出了一种收敛速度快的一阶优化算法（FOA）。通过对FOA的理论分析，证明了该算法具有二次收敛性。矩阵完成任务中的实验表明，FOA比黎曼流形上的其他一阶优化方法具有更好的性能。提出了一种基于FOA的快速子空间追踪方法，在低秩矩阵变换上求解基于增广Lagrange方法的低秩表示模型。通过对合成和实际数据集的实验结果表明，FOA和SP-RPRG（ALM）在更快的收敛性和更高的精度方面可以获得优越的性能。
