##### Abstract
Our sensor system consists of a combination of Photonic Mixer Device - PMD and Mono optical cameras. Some traffic signs have stripes at 45{deg}. These traffic signs cancel different restrictions on the road. We detect this class of signs with Radon transformation. Here the Radon transformation is calculated using Central Slice Theorem. We approximate the slice of spectrum by the Discrete Cosine Transformation (DCT).
