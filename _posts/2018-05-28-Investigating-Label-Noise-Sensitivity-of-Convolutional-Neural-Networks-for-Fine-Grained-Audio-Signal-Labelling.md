##### Abstract
We measure the effect of small amounts of systematic and random label noise caused by slightly misaligned ground truth labels in a fine grained audio signal labeling task. The task we choose to demonstrate these effects on is also known as framewise polyphonic transcription or note quantized multi-f0 estimation, and transforms a monaural audio signal into a sequence of note indicator labels. It will be shown that even slight misalignments have clearly apparent effects, demonstrating a great sensitivity of convolutional neural networks to label noise. The implications are clear: when using convolutional neural networks for fine grained audio signal labeling tasks, great care has to be taken to ensure that the annotations have precise timing, and are free from systematic or random error as much as possible - even small misalignments will have a noticeable impact.

我们测量细粒度音频信号标记任务中微小偏差的地面真实标签引起的少量系统和随机标签噪声的影响。我们选择演示这些效果的任务也被称为帧边复音转录或音符量化多f0估计，并将单声道音频信号转换为音符指示标签序列。它将表明，即使轻微的不对齐也有明显的效果，表明卷积神经网络对标记噪声具有很高的灵敏度。其含义很明确：当使用卷积神经网络进行细粒度音频信号标记任务时，必须非常小心以确保注释具有精确的时序，并尽可能避免系统性或随机性错误 - 即使很小的错位也会有明显的影响。
