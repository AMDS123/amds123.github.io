##### Abstract
Person re-identification in large-scale multi-camera networks is a challenging task because of the spatio-temporal uncertainty and high complexity due to large numbers of cameras and people. To handle these difficulties, additional information such as camera network topology should be provided, which is also difficult to automatically estimate. In this paper, we propose a unified framework which jointly solves both person re-id and camera network topology inference problems. The proposed framework takes general multi-camera network environments into account. To effectively show the superiority of the proposed framework, we also provide a new person re-id dataset with full annotations, named SLP, captured in the synchronized multi-camera network. Experimental results show that the proposed methods are promising for both person re-id and camera topology inference tasks.

大规模多摄像机网络中的人员重新识别是一个具有挑战性的任务，由于大量摄像机和人员的时空不确定性和高复杂度。为了解决这些困难，还需要提供摄像机网络拓扑等附加信息，这也是难以自动估算的。在本文中，我们提出了一个统一的框架，联合解决个人身份识别和摄像机网络拓扑推理问题。提出的框架考虑了一般的多摄像机网络环境。为了有效地展示所提出的框架的优越性，我们还提供了一个新的人员re-id数据集，其中包含了在同步多摄像机网络中捕获的全部注释，命名为SLP。实验结果表明，所提出的方法是有前途的个人身份识别和相机拓扑推断任务。
