##### Abstract
Modern automotive vehicles are often equipped with a budget commercial rolling shutter camera. These devices often produce distorted images due to the inter-row delay of the camera while capturing the image. Recent methods for monocular rolling shutter motion compensation utilize blur kernel and the straightness property of line segments. However, these methods are limited to handling rotational motion and also are not fast enough to operate in real time. In this paper, we propose a minimal solver for the rolling shutter motion compensation which assumes known vertical direction of the camera. Thanks to the Ackermann motion model of vehicles which consists of only two motion parameters, and two parameters for the simplified depth assumption that lead to a 4-line algorithm. The proposed minimal solver estimates the rolling shutter camera motion efficiently and accurately. The extensive experiments on real and simulated datasets demonstrate the benefits of our approach in terms of qualitative and quantitative results.

现代汽车经常配备预算商业卷帘式照相机。这些设备通常在拍摄图像时由于相机的行间延迟而产生失真的图像。近来用于单眼卷帘快门运动补偿的方法利用了模糊核和线段的直线性。然而，这些方法仅限于处理旋转运动，而且还不够快以便实时操作。在本文中，我们提出了一个最小解算器的滚动快门运动补偿，假定摄像机已知的垂直方向。由于仅由两个运动参数组成的车辆的阿克曼运动模型以及用于导致四线算法的简化深度假设的两个参数。所提出的最小求解器有效且准确地估计卷帘快门相机运动。对实际和模拟数据集进行广泛的实验证明了我们的方法在定性和定量结果方面的好处。
