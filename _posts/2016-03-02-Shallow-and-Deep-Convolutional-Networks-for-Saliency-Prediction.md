##### Abstract
The prediction of salient areas in images has been traditionally addressed with hand-crafted features based on neuroscience principles. This paper, however, addresses the problem with a completely data-driven approach by training a convolutional neural network (convnet). The learning process is formulated as a minimization of a loss function that measures the Euclidean distance of the predicted saliency map with the provided ground truth. The recent publication of large datasets of saliency prediction has provided enough data to train end-to-end architectures that are both fast and accurate. Two designs are proposed: a shallow convnet trained from scratch, and a another deeper solution whose first three layers are adapted from another network trained for classification. To the authors knowledge, these are the first end-to-end CNNs trained and tested for the purpose of saliency prediction.

传统上通过基于神经科学原理的手工特征来预测图像中的显着区域。然而，本文通过训练一个卷积神经网络（convnet），用完全数据驱动的方法解决了这个问题。学习过程被表述为损失函数的最小化，其测量预测的显着图的欧几里德距离与所提供的基本事实。最近出版的大型数据集显着性预测已经提供了足够的数据来训练端对端架构，既快速又准确。提出了两种设计方案：一种是从头开始训练的浅隐藏式网络，另一种是深度解决方案，其前三层是从另一个网络进行分类训练的。就作者的知识而言，这些是为显着预测目的而训练和测试的第一批端到端CNN。
