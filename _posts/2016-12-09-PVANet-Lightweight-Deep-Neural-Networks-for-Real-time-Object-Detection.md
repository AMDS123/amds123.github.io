##### Abstract
In object detection, reducing computational cost is as important as improving accuracy for most practical usages. This paper proposes a novel network structure, which is an order of magnitude lighter than other state-of-the-art networks while maintaining the accuracy. Based on the basic principle of more layers with less channels, this new deep neural network minimizes its redundancy by adopting recent innovations including C.ReLU and Inception structure. We also show that this network can be trained efficiently to achieve solid results on well-known object detection benchmarks: 84.9% and 84.2% mAP on VOC2007 and VOC2012 while the required compute is less than 10% of the recent ResNet-101.

在目标检测中，降低计算成本与提高大多数实际应用的精度一样重要。本文提出了一种新颖的网络结构，它在保持精度的同时比其他最先进的网络要轻一个数量级。基于多层次，少信道的基本原理，该新型深度神经网络采用C.ReLU和Inception结构等新近的创新技术，最大限度地减少了冗余。我们还表明，这个网络可以被有效地训练，以在众所周知的物体检测基准上获得可靠的结果：在VOC2007和VOC2012上的mAP分别为84.9％和84.2％，而所需的计算量不到最近ResNet-101的10％。
