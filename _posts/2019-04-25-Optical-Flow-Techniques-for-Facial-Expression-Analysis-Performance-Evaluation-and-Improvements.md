##### Abstract
Optical flow techniques are becoming increasingly performant and robust when estimating motion in a scene, but their performance has yet to be proven in the area of facial expression recognition. In this work, a variety of optical flow approaches are evaluated across multiple facial expression datasets, so as to provide a consistent performance evaluation. Additionally, the strengths of multiple optical flow approaches are combined in a novel data augmentation scheme. Under this scheme, increases in average accuracy of up to 6% (depending on the choice of optical flow approaches and dataset) have been achieved.
