##### Abstract
We present LADDER, the first deep reinforcement learning agent that can successfully learn control policies for large-scale real-world problems directly from raw inputs composed of high-level semantic information. The agent is based on an asynchronous stochastic variant of DQN (Deep Q Network) named DASQN. The inputs of the agent are plain-text descriptions of states of a game of incomplete information, i.e. real-time large scale online auctions, and the rewards are auction profits of very large scale. We apply the agent to an essential portion of JD's online RTB (real-time bidding) advertising business and find that it easily beats the former state-of-the-art bidding policy that had been carefully engineered and calibrated by human experts: during JD.com's June 18th anniversary sale, the agent increased the company's ads revenue from the portion by more than 50%, while the advertisers' ROI (return on investment) also improved significantly.

##### Abstract (translated by Google)
LADDER是第一个可以直接从高级语义信息构成的原始输入中成功学习大规模现实世界问题的控制策略的深度强化学习代理。代理基于名为DASQN的DQN（Deep Q Network）的异步随机变体。代理人的投入是不完全信息博弈状态的明文描述，即实时大规模在线拍卖，报酬是非常大规模的拍卖利润。我们将代理人应用于JD在线实时出价广告业务的一个重要部分，并发现它很容易地胜过了由人类专家精心设计和校准的以前最先进的出价策略：在JD .com的6月18周年纪念销售，该代理公司的广告收入从这一部分增加了50％以上，而广告主的投资回报率（投资回报）​​也大大提高。
