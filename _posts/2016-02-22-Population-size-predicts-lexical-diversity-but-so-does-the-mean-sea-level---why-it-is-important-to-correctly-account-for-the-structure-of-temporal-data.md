##### Abstract
In order to demonstrate why it is important to correctly account for the (serial dependent) structure of temporal data, we document an apparently spectacular relationship between population size and lexical diversity: for five out of seven investigated languages, there is a strong relationship between population size and lexical diversity of the primary language in this country. We show that this relationship is the result of a misspecified model that does not consider the temporal aspect of the data by presenting a similar but nonsensical relationship between the global annual mean sea level and lexical diversity. Given the fact that in the recent past, several studies were published that present surprising links between different economic, cultural, political and (socio-)demographical variables on the one hand and cultural or linguistic characteristics on the other hand, but seem to suffer from exactly this problem, we explain the cause of the misspecification and show that it has profound consequences. We demonstrate how simple transformation of the time series can often solve problems of this type and argue that the evaluation of the plausibility of a relationship is important in this context. We hope that our paper will help both researchers and reviewers to understand why it is important to use special models for the analysis of data with a natural temporal ordering.

为了说明为什么正确解释时间数据的（依赖于序列的）结构是重要的，我们记录了人口规模和词汇多样性之间的显着的关系：对于七种调查语言中的五种，人口规模和词汇的多样性在这个国家的主要语言。我们表明，这种关系是一个错误指定的模型的结果，不考虑数据的时间方面，提出了全球年平均海平面和词汇多样性之间类似但无关紧要的关系。鉴于近年来发表的一些研究结果表明，不同的经济，文化，政治和（社会）人口变量与文化或语言特征之间存在令人惊讶的联系，但似乎受到正是这个问题，我们解释了错误指定的原因，表明它有深远的后果。我们证明时间序列的简单转换通常可以解决这种类型的问题，并认为在这种情况下评估关系的合理性是重要的。我们希望我们的论文能够帮助研究人员和审稿人理解为什么使用特殊模型来分析具有自然时间顺序的数据是非常重要的。
