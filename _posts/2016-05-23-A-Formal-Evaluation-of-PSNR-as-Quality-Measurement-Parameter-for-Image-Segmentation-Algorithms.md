##### Abstract
Quality evaluation of image segmentation algorithms are still subject of debate and research. Currently, there is no generic metric that could be applied to any algorithm reliably. This article contains an evaluation for the PSRN (Peak Signal-To-Noise Ratio) as a metric which has been used to evaluate threshold level selection as well as the number of thresholds in the case of multi-level segmentation. The results obtained in this study suggest that the PSNR is not an adequate quality measurement for segmentation algorithms.

##### Abstract (translated by Google)
图像分割算法的质量评价仍然是争论和研究的课题。目前，没有可以可靠地应用于任何算法的通用度量。本文包含对PSRN（峰值信噪比）的评估，作为用于评估阈值水平选择的度量以及在多级分割情况下的阈值数量。在这项研究中获得的结果表明，PSNR不是一个足够的质量测量分割算法。
