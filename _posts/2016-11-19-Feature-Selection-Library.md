##### Abstract
Feature Selection Library (FSLib) is a widely applicable MATLAB library for Feature Selection (FS). FS is an essential component of machine learning and data mining which has been studied for many years under many different conditions and in diverse scenarios. These algorithms aim at ranking and selecting a subset of relevant features according to their degrees of relevance, preference, or importance as defined in a specific application. Because feature selection can reduce the amount of features used for training classification models, it alleviates the effect of the curse of dimensionality, speeds up the learning process, improves model's performance, and enhances data understanding. This work provides an overview of the feature selection algorithms included in the toolbox among: filter, embedded, and wrappers methods.

特征选择库（FSLib）是用于特征选择（FS）的广泛应用的MATLAB库。 FS是机器学习和数据挖掘的一个重要组成部分，在许多不同的情况下，在不同的情况下已经研究了多年。这些算法旨在根据特定应用中定义的相关度，偏好或重要性对相关特征的子集进行排序和选择。由于特征选择可以减少用于训练分类模型的特征量，减轻了维数灾难的影响，加快了学习过程，提高了模型的性能，增强了对数据的理解。这项工作提供了工具箱中包含的特征选择算法的概述：过滤器，嵌入式和包装器方法。
