##### Abstract
Most approaches in algorithmic fairness constrain machine learning methods so the resulting predictions satisfy one of several intuitive notions of fairness. While this may help private companies comply with non-discrimination laws or avoid negative publicity, we believe it is often too little, too late. By the time the training data is collected, individuals in disadvantaged groups have already suffered from discrimination and lost opportunities due to factors out of their control. In the present work we focus instead on interventions such as a new public policy, and in particular, how to maximize their positive effects while improving the fairness of the overall system. We use causal methods to model the effects of interventions, allowing for potential interference--each individual's outcome may depend on who else receives the intervention. We demonstrate this with an example of allocating a budget of teaching resources using a dataset of schools in New York City.

##### Abstract (translated by Google)
算法公平性中的大多数方法都限制了机器学习方法，因此得到的预测满足几个直观的公平性概念之一。虽然这可能有助于私营公司遵守不歧视法律或避免负面宣传，但我们认为这往往太少，为时已晚。在收集培训数据时，处于不利地位的群体中的个人已经因受控制因素而遭受歧视并失去了机会。在目前的工作中，我们将重点放在诸如新公共政策等干预措施上，特别是如何在提高整体系统公平性的同时最大限度地发挥其积极作用。我们使用因果方法来模拟干预措施的效果，允许潜在的干扰 - 每个人的结果可能取决于谁接受干预。我们通过使用纽约市学校数据集来分配教学资源预算来举例说明。
