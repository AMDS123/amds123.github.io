##### Abstract
We study the effects of charge polarization on the extended physical properties of superlattices, such as transmission coefficients and valence band structure. We consider both linear and parabolic modulation of the band edge. Based on the theory of finite periodic systems (TFPS), analytic expressions and high precision calculations of the relevant physical quantities for n-cell systems are obtained. New and also well-known features of these systems are identified. Besides the well-known energy bandstructure, we also have the field bandstructure, with interesting characteristics.Wider field gaps at stronger internal electric fields and higher density of field bands for larger layer widths are some of these characteristics. Well denned level density asymmetries identify the minibands induced by charge polarization or the so-called Quantum Confining Stark Effect. We present the n-cell transmission amplitudes, transmission coefficients and miniband structures for different values of the relevant parameters.
