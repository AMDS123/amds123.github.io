##### Abstract
Approximation theory plays an important role in image processing, especially image deconvolution and decomposition. For piecewise smooth images, there are many methods that have been developed over the past thirty years. The goal of this study is to devise similar and practical methodology for handling textured images. This problem is motivated by forensic imaging, since fingerprints, shoeprints and bullet ballistic evidence are textured images. In particular, it is known that texture information is almost destroyed by a blur operator, such as a blurred ballistic image captured from a low-cost microscope. The contribution of this work is twofold: first, we propose a mathematical model for textured image deconvolution and decomposition into four meaningful components, using a high-order partial differential equation approach based on the directional mean curvature. Second, we uncover a link between functional analysis and multiscale sampling theory, e.g., harmonic analysis and filter banks. Both theoretical results and examples with natural images are provided to illustrate the performance of the proposed model.

近似理论在图像处理中起着重要的作用，特别是图像的去卷积和分解。对于分段平滑的图像，在过去的三十年中已经发展了许多方法。这项研究的目标是设计类似和实用的处理纹理图像的方法。这个问题是由法医成像，因为指纹，shoeprints和子弹弹道证据是纹理图像。特别是，已知纹理信息几乎被模糊算子破坏，例如从低成本显微镜捕获的模糊的弹道图像。这项工作的贡献是双重的：首先，我们提出了一个基于方向平均曲率的高阶偏微分方程方法的纹理图像反卷积和分解成四个有意义的分量的数学模型。其次，我们揭示功能分析与多尺度抽样理论之间的联系，例如谐波分析和滤波器组。提供了理论结果和自然图像的例子来说明所提出的模型的性能。
