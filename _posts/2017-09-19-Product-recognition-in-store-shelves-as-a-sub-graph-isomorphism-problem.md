##### Abstract
The arrangement of products in store shelves is carefully planned to maximize sales and keep customers happy. However, verifying compliance of real shelves to the ideal layout is a costly task routinely performed by the store personnel. In this paper, we propose a computer vision pipeline to recognize products on shelves and verify compliance to the planned layout. We deploy local invariant features together with a novel formulation of the product recognition problem as a sub-graph isomorphism between the items appearing in the given image and the ideal layout. This allows for auto-localizing the given image within the aisle or store and improving recognition dramatically.

产品在货架上的安排是精心策划的，以最大限度的销售和让顾客满意。然而，验证真实货架是否符合理想布局是商店人员常规执行的昂贵任务。在本文中，我们提出了计算机视觉管道来识别货架上的产品，并验证是否符合计划的布局。我们将局部不变特征与产品识别问题的一个新颖表达式一起部署，作为给定图像中出现的项目与理想布局之间的子图同构。这允许自动本地化给定的图像在通道或存储，并提高识别戏剧性。
