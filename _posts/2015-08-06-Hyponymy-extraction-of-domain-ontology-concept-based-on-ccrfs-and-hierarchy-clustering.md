##### Abstract
Concept hierarchy is the backbone of ontology, and the concept hierarchy acquisition has been a hot topic in the field of ontology learning. this paper proposes a hyponymy extraction method of domain ontology concept based on cascaded conditional random field(CCRFs) and hierarchy clustering. It takes free text as extracting object, adopts CCRFs identifying the domain concepts. First the low layer of CCRFs is used to identify simple domain concept, then the results are sent to the high layer, in which the nesting concepts are recognized. Next we adopt hierarchy clustering to identify the hyponymy relation between domain ontology concepts. The experimental results demonstrate the proposed method is efficient.

概念层次是本体的骨干，概念层次的获取一直是本体学习领域的热门话题。提出了一种基于级联条件随机场（CCRF）和层次聚类的领域本体概念的地名提取方法。它采用自由文本作为提取对象，采用CCRFs来识别域的概念。首先使用低层CCRF来识别简单的域概念，然后将结果发送到高层，其中嵌套概念被识别。接下来我们采用层次聚类来确定领域本体概念之间的下位关系。实验结果表明所提出的方法是有效的。
