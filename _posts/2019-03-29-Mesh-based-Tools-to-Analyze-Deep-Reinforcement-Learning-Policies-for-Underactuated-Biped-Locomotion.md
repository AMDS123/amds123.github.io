##### Abstract
In this paper, we present a mesh-based approach to analyze stability and robustness of the policies obtained via deep reinforcement learning for various biped gaits of a five-link planar model. Intuitively, one would expect that including perturbations and/or other types of noise during training would likely result in more robustness of the resulting control policy. However, one would like to have a quantitative and computationally-efficient means of evaluating the degree to which this might be so. Rather than relying on Monte Carlo simulations, our goal is to provide more sophisticated tools to assess robustness properties of such policies. Our work is motivated by the twin hypotheses that contraction of dynamics, when achievable, can simplify control and that control policies obtained via deep learning may therefore exhibit tendency to contract to lower-dimensional manifolds within the full state space, as a result. The tractability of our mesh-based tools in this work provides some evidence that this may be so.
