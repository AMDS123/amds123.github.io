##### Abstract
In this paper, we propose a novel unsupervised learning method for the lexical acquisition of words related to places visited by robots, from human continuous speech signals. We address the problem of learning novel words by a robot that has no prior knowledge of these words except for a primitive acoustic model. Further, we propose a method that allows a robot to effectively use the learned words and their meanings for self-localization tasks. The proposed method is nonparametric Bayesian spatial concept acquisition method (SpCoA) that integrates the generative model for self-localization and the unsupervised word segmentation in uttered sentences via latent variables related to the spatial concept. We implemented the proposed method SpCoA on SIGVerse, which is a simulation environment, and TurtleBot2, which is a mobile robot in a real environment. Further, we conducted experiments for evaluating the performance of SpCoA. The experimental results showed that SpCoA enabled the robot to acquire the names of places from speech sentences. They also revealed that the robot could effectively utilize the acquired spatial concepts and reduce the uncertainty in self-localization.

在本文中，我们提出了一种新的无监督学习方法，用于从人类连续的语音信号中获取与机器人访问的地点有关的词语的词汇。我们解决了一个机器人学习小说的问题，除了原始的声学模型之外，这些机器人对这些词语没有先验知识。此外，我们提出了一种方法，允许机器人有效地使用学习的单词及其意义进行自我定位任务。提出的方法是非参数贝叶斯空间概念获取方法（SpCoA），通过与空间概念相关的潜变量，将自我定位的生成模型和发音句子中的无监督分词相结合。我们在仿真环境SIGVerse上实现了SpCoA方法，在真实环境下实现了移动机器人TurtleBot2。此外，我们进行了评估SpCoA性能的实验。实验结果表明，SpCoA使机器人能够从语音句子中获取地名。他们还透露，机器人可以有效利用所获得的空间概念，减少自我定位的不确定性。
