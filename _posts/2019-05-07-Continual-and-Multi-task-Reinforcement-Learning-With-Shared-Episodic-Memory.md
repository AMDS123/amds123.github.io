##### Abstract
Episodic memory plays an important role in the behavior of animals and humans. It allows the accumulation of information about current state of the environment in a task-agnostic way. This episodic representation can be later accessed by down-stream tasks in order to make their execution more efficient. In this work, we introduce the neural architecture with shared episodic memory (SEM) for learning and the sequential execution of multiple tasks. We explicitly split the encoding of episodic memory and task-specific memory into separate recurrent sub-networks. An agent augmented with SEM was able to effectively reuse episodic knowledge collected during other tasks to improve its policy on a current task in the Taxi problem. Repeated use of episodic representation in continual learning experiments facilitated acquisition of novel skills in the same environment.
