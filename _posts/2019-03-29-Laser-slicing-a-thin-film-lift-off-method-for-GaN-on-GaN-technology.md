##### Abstract
A femtosecond laser focused inside bulk GaN was used to slice a thin GaN film with an epitaxial device structure from a bulk GaN substrate. The demonstrated laser slicing lift-off process did not require any special release layers in the epitaxial structure. GaN film with a thickness of 5 $\mu$m and an InGaN LED epitaxial device structure was lifted off a GaN substrate and transferred onto a copper substrate. The electroluminescence of the LED chip after the laser slicing lift-off was demonstrated.
