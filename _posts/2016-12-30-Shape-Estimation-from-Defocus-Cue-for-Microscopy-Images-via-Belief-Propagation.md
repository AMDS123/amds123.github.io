##### Abstract
In recent years, the usefulness of 3D shape estimation is being realized in microscopic or close-range imaging, as the 3D information can further be used in various applications. Due to limited depth of field at such small distances, the defocus blur induced in images can provide information about the 3D shape of the object. The task of `shape from defocus' (SFD), involves the problem of estimating good quality 3D shape estimates from images with depth-dependent defocus blur. While the research area of SFD is quite well-established, the approaches have largely demonstrated results on objects with bulk/coarse shape variation. However, in many cases, objects studied under microscopes often involve fine/detailed structures, which have not been explicitly considered in most methods. In addition, given that, in recent years, large data volumes are typically associated with microscopy related applications, it is also important for such SFD methods to be efficient. In this work, we provide an indication of the usefulness of the Belief Propagation (BP) approach in addressing these concerns for SFD. BP has been known to be an efficient combinatorial optimization approach, and has been empirically demonstrated to yield good quality solutions in low-level vision problems such as image restoration, stereo disparity estimation etc. For exploiting the efficiency of BP in SFD, we assume local space-invariance of the defocus blur, which enables the application of BP in a straightforward manner. Even with such an assumption, the ability of BP to provide good quality solutions while using non-convex priors, reflects in yielding plausible shape estimates in presence of fine structures on the objects under microscopy imaging.

近年来，3D形状估计的有用性正在微观或近距成像中实现，因为3D信息可以进一步用于各种应用。由于在如此小的距离处有限的景深，图像中引起的散焦模糊可以提供关于物体的3D形状的信息。 “从散焦形状”（SFD）的任务涉及从具有深度依赖性散焦模糊的图像估计高质量3D形状估计的问题。虽然SFD的研究领域已经相当成熟，但是这些方法已经在大的/粗糙的形状变化的对象上得到了很好的结果。然而，在许多情况下，在显微镜下研究的物体通常涉及精细/细节结构，这在大多数方法中尚未被明确考虑。另外，鉴于近年来大量的数据通常与显微镜相关的应用相关联，所以对于这样的SFD方法是高效的也是重要的。在这项工作中，我们提供了信念传播（BP）方法在解决SFD的这些问题方面的实用性。 BP已被认为是一种有效的组合优化方法，并且已经被实证证明能够在诸如图像恢复，立体视差估计等的低级视觉问题中产生优质的解决方案。为了利用SFD中的BP的效率，离焦模糊的空间不变性，使BP能够直接应用。即使有这样的假设，在使用非凸起的前提下BP能够提供高质量的解决方案的能力反映了在显微成像下存在精细结构的情况下产生合理的形状估计。
