##### Abstract
Control of robot orientation in Cartesian space implicates some difficulties, because the rotation group SO(3) is not contractible, and only globally contractible state spaces support continuous and globally asymptotically stable feedback control systems. In this paper, unit quaternions are used to represent orientations, and it is first shown that the unit quaternion set minus one single point is contractible. This is used to design a control system for temporally coupled dynamical movement primitives (DMPs) in Cartesian space. The functionality of the control system is verified experimentally on an industrial robot.
