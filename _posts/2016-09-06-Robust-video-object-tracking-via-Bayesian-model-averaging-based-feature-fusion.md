##### Abstract
In this article, we are concerned with tracking an object of interest in video stream. We propose an algorithm that is robust against occlusion, the presence of confusing colors, abrupt changes in the object feature space and changes in object size. We develop the algorithm within a Bayesian modeling framework. The state space model is used for capturing the temporal correlation in the sequence of frame images by modeling the underlying dynamics of the tracking system. The Bayesian model averaging (BMA) strategy is proposed for fusing multi-clue information in the observations. Any number of object features are allowed to be involved in the proposed framework. Every feature represents one source of information to be fused and is associated with an observation model. The state inference is performed by employing the particle filter methods. In comparison with related approaches, the BMA based tracker is shown to have robustness, expressivity, and comprehensibility.

##### Abstract (translated by Google)
在这篇文章中，我们关注跟踪视频流中感兴趣的对象。我们提出一个强大的算法，可以防止遮挡，混淆的颜色，对象特征空间的突然变化以及对象大小的变化。我们在贝叶斯建模框架内开发算法。状态空间模型被用于通过对跟踪系统的基础动态进行建模来捕获帧图像序列中的时间相关性。贝叶斯模型平均（BMA）策略被提出用于融合观测中的多线索信息。所提议的框架中允许任何数量的目标特征参与。每个特征代表一个要融合的信息来源，并与一个观测模型相关联。状态推断通过采用粒子滤波器方法来执行。与相关方法相比，基于BMA的跟踪器具有鲁棒性，表达性和可理解性。
