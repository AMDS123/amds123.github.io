##### Abstract
Connected vehicle fleets are deployed worldwide in several industrial IoT scenarios. With the gradual increase of machines being controlled and managed through networked smart devices, the predictive maintenance potential grows rapidly. Predictive maintenance has the potential of optimizing uptime as well as performance such that time and labor associated with inspections and preventive maintenance are reduced. In order to understand the trends of vehicle faults with respect to important vehicle attributes viz mileage, age, vehicle type etc this problem is addressed through hierarchical modified fuzzy support vector machine (HMFSVM). The proposed method is compared with other commonly used approaches like logistic regression, random forests and support vector machines. This helps better implementation of telematics data to ensure preventative management as part of the desired solution. The superiority of the proposed method is highlighted through several experimental results.

连接车队在全球范围内部署在几个工业物联网场景中。随着通过联网智能设备控制和管理机器的逐渐增加，预测性维护潜力迅速增长。预测性维护具有优化正常运行时间和性能的潜力，从而减少与检查和预防性维护相关的时间和劳动。为了解车辆故障在重要车辆属性（即里程，年龄，车辆类型等）方面的趋势，通过分层修改模糊支持向量机（HMFSVM）来解决该问题。将所提出的方法与其他常用方法（如逻辑回归，随机森林和支持向量机）进行比较。这有助于更好地实施远程信息处理数据，以确保将预防性管理作为所需解决方案的一部分。通过几个实验结果突出了所提出方法的优越性。
