##### Abstract
In this paper, an extended combined approach of phrase based statistical machine translation (SMT), example based MT (EBMT) and rule based MT (RBMT) is proposed to develop a novel hybrid data driven MT system capable of outperforming the baseline SMT, EBMT and RBMT systems from which it is derived. In short, the proposed hybrid MT process is guided by the rule based MT after getting a set of partial candidate translations provided by EBMT and SMT subsystems. Previous works have shown that EBMT systems are capable of outperforming the phrase-based SMT systems and RBMT approach has the strength of generating structurally and morphologically more accurate results. This hybrid approach increases the fluency, accuracy and grammatical precision which improve the quality of a machine translation system. A comparison of the proposed hybrid machine translation (HTM) model with renowned translators i.e. Google, BING and Babylonian is also presented which shows that the proposed model works better on sentences with ambiguity as well as comprised of idioms than others.

本文提出了基于短语的统计机器翻译（SMT），基于实例的MT（EBMT）和基于规则的MT（RBMT）的扩展组合方法来开发一种能够超越基线SMT，EBMT以及从中得出的RBMT系统。简而言之，在获得由EBMT和SMT子系统提供的一组部分候选翻译之后，所提出的混合MT过程在基于规则的MT的指导下进行。以前的研究表明，EBMT系统能够超越基于短语的SMT系统，而RBMT方法具有在结构和形态上产生更精确结果的优势。这种混合方法提高了流畅性，准确性和语法精确度，从而提高了机器翻译系统的质量。提出的混合机器翻译（HTM）模型与着名翻译人员，即Google，BING和巴比伦人的比较也表明，所提出的模型对含义模糊的句子以及由成语组成的句子比其他模式更好地工作。
