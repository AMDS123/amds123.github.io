##### Abstract
A synfire chain is a network that can generate repeated spike patterns with millisecond precision. Although synfire chains with only one activity propagation mode have been intensively analyzed with several neuron models, those with several stable propagation modes have not been thoroughly investigated. By using the leaky integrate-and-fire neuron model, we constructed a layered associative network embedded with memory patterns. We analyzed the network dynamics with the Fokker-Planck equation. First, we addressed the stability of one memory pattern as a propagating spike volley. We showed that memory patterns propagate as pulse packets. Second, we investigated the activity when we activated two different memory patterns. Simultaneous activation of two memory patterns with the same strength led the propagating pattern to a mixed state. In contrast, when the activations had different strengths, the pulse packet converged to a two-peak state. Finally, we studied the effect of the preceding pulse packet on the following pulse packet. The following pulse packet was modified from its original activated memory pattern, and it converged to a two-peak state, mixed state or non-spike state depending on the time interval.

一个synfire链是一个网络，可以以毫秒的精度产生重复的尖峰模式。尽管只有一种活动传播模式的同步链已经用多种神经元模型进行了深入分析，但是具有多种稳定传播模式的模型尚未被彻底研究。通过使用漏积分和火神经元模型，我们构建了一个嵌入存储器模式的分层关联网络。我们用Fokker-Planck方程分析了网络动力学。首先，我们解决了一个记忆模式作为传播尖峰凌空的稳定性。我们展示了内存模式作为脉冲包传播。其次，我们调查了当我们激活两种不同的记忆模式时的活动。同时激活具有相同强度的两个存储器模式使得传播模式变为混合状态。相反，当激活具有不同的强度时，脉冲包收敛到双峰状态。最后，我们研究了前面的脉冲包对下面的脉冲包的影响。下面的脉冲包从其原始的激活存储器模式被修改，并且根据时间间隔，它收敛到双峰状态，混合状态或非尖峰状态。
