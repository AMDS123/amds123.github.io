##### Abstract
Gastric endoscopy is a common clinical practice that enables medical doctors to diagnose the stomach inside a body. In order to identify a gastric lesion's location such as early gastric cancer within the stomach, this work addressed to reconstruct the 3D shape of a whole stomach with color texture information generated from a standard monocular endoscope video. Previous works have tried to reconstruct the 3D structures of various organs from endoscope images. However, they are mainly focused on a partial surface. In this work, we investigated how to enable structure-from-motion (SfM) to reconstruct the whole shape of a stomach from a standard endoscope video. We specifically investigated the combined effect of chromo-endoscopy and color channel selection on SfM. Our study found that 3D reconstruction of the whole stomach can be achieved by using red channel images captured under chromo-endoscopy by spreading indigo carmine (IC) dye on the stomach surface.
