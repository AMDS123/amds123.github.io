##### Abstract
The intelligent Processing technique is more and more attractive to researchers due to its ability to deal with key problems in Vehicular Ad hoc networks. However, several problems in applying intelligent processing technologies in VANETs remain open. The existing applications are comprehensively reviewed and discussed, and classified into different categories in this paper. Their strategies, advantages/disadvantages, and performances are elaborated. By generalizing different tactics in various applications related to different scenarios of VANETs and evaluating their performances, several promising directions for future research have been suggested.
