##### Abstract
Large scale studies of group differences in healthy controls and patients and screenings for early stage disease prevention programs require processing and analysis of extensive multisubject datasets. Complexity of the task increases even further when segmenting structural MRI of the brain into an atlas with more than 50 regions. Current automatic approaches are time-consuming and hardly scalable; they often involve many error prone intermediate steps and don't utilize other available modalities. To alleviate these problems, we propose a feedforward fully convolutional neural network trained on the output produced by the state of the art models. Incredible speed due to available powerful GPUs neural network makes this analysis much easier and faster (from $>10$ hours to a minute). The proposed model is more than two orders of magnitudes faster than the state of the art and yet as accurate. We have evaluated the network's performance by comparing it with the state of the art in the task of differentiating region volumes of healthy controls and patients with schizophrenia on a dataset with 311 subjects. This comparison provides a strong evidence that speed did not harm the accuracy. The overall quality may also be increased by utilizing multi-modal datasets (not an easy task for other models) by simple adding more modalities as an input. Our model will be useful in large-scale studies as well as in clinical care solutions, where it can significantly reduce delay between the patient screening and the result.

大规模的健康对照组和患者组的差异性研究以及早期疾病预防项目筛查需要处理和分析广泛的多个主题数据集。将脑部结构MRI分割成50多个区域的图谱时，任务的复杂性进一步增加。目前的自动方法是耗时且难以扩展的;他们经常涉及很多容易出错的中间步骤，并没有使用其他可用的模式。为了缓解这些问题，我们提出了一个前馈完全卷积神经网络，训练由最先进的模型产生的输出。由于可用强大的GPU神经网络，令人难以置信的速度使分析变得更容易，更快速（从10美元到1分钟）。所提出的模型比现有技术快两个数量级以上，并且精确。我们通过与311名受试者的数据集中区分健康对照和精神分裂症患者的区域容量的现状进行比较，评估了网络的表现。这个比较提供了一个有力的证据，即速度并没有损害准确性。通过简单地添加更多的模态作为输入，通过利用多模态数据集（对于其他模型不是简单的任务）也可以提高整体质量。我们的模型将在大规模研究和临床护理解决方案中发挥作用，从而显着减少患者筛查和结果之间的延迟。
