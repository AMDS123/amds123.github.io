##### Abstract
For speech recognition, deep neural networks (DNNs) have significantly improved the recognition accuracy in most of benchmark datasets and application domains. However, compared to the conventional Gaussian mixture models, DNN-based acoustic models usually have much larger number of model parameters, making it challenging for their applications in resource constrained platforms, e.g., mobile devices. In this paper, we study the application of the recently proposed highway network to train small-footprint DNNs, which are {\it thinner} and {\it deeper}, and have significantly smaller number of model parameters compared to conventional DNNs. We investigated this approach on the AMI meeting speech transcription corpus which has around 70 hours of audio data. The highway neural networks constantly outperformed their plain DNN counterparts, and the number of model parameters can be reduced significantly without sacrificing the recognition accuracy.

对于语音识别，深度神经网络（DNN）已经显着提高了大多数基准数据集和应用领域的识别精度。然而，与传统的高斯混合模型相比，基于DNN的声学模型通常具有更多的模型参数，使得它们在资源受限的平台（例如移动设备）中的应用具有挑战性。在本文中，我们研究了最近提出的公路网络的应用，以训练小尺寸的DNN，它们更薄，更深，与传统的DNN相比，模型参数的数量要少得多。我们在AMI会议语音转录语料库上调查了这种方法，该语料库有大约70个小时的音频数据。公路神经网络的性能始终优于普通DNN网络，在不牺牲识别精度的情况下，模型参数的数量可以大大减少。
