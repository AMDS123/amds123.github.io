##### Abstract
Gender is one of the most common attributes used to describe an individual. It is used in multiple domains such as human computer interaction, marketing, security, and demographic reports. Research has been performed to automate the task of gender recognition in constrained environment using face images, however, limited attention has been given to gender classification in unconstrained scenarios. This work attempts to address the challenging problem of gender classification in multi-spectral low resolution face images. We propose a robust Class Representative Autoencoder model, termed as AutoGen for the same. The proposed model aims to minimize the intra-class variations while maximizing the inter-class variations for the learned feature representations. Results on visible as well as near infrared spectrum data for different resolutions and multiple databases depict the efficacy of the proposed model. Comparative results with existing approaches and two commercial off-the-shelf systems further motivate the use of class representative features for classification.

性别是用来描述个人的最常见属性之一。它用于多个领域，例如人机交互，市场营销，安全和人口统计报告。已经进行了研究以使使用人脸图像的受限环境中的性别识别任务自动化，然而，在无约束的情况下对性别分类给予了有限的关注。这项工作试图解决多光谱低分辨率人脸图像中性别分类的挑战性问题。我们提出一个强大的类代表自动编码器模型，称为AutoGen。提出的模型旨在最大限度地减少类内变异，同时最大化学习特征表示的类间变化。针对不同分辨率和多个数据库的可见光以及近红外光谱数据的结果描述了所提出的模型的功效。与现有方法和两个商用现成系统的比较结果进一步激发了使用类别代表特征进行分类。
