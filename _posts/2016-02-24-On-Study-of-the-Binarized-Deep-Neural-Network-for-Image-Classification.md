##### Abstract
Recently, the deep neural network (derived from the artificial neural network) has attracted many researchers' attention by its outstanding performance. However, since this network requires high-performance GPUs and large storage, it is very hard to use it on individual devices. In order to improve the deep neural network, many trials have been made by refining the network structure or training strategy. Unlike those trials, in this paper, we focused on the basic propagation function of the artificial neural network and proposed the binarized deep neural network. This network is a pure binary system, in which all the values and calculations are binarized. As a result, our network can save a lot of computational resource and storage. Therefore, it is possible to use it on various devices. Moreover, the experimental results proved the feasibility of the proposed network.

最近，深度神经网络（由人工神经网络导出）以其出色的性能吸引了众多研究者的关注。但是，由于这个网络需要高性能的GPU和大容量的存储器，所以很难在单个设备上使用它。为了改善深度神经网络，通过细化网络结构或训练策略进行了许多试验。与那些试验不同，本文主要研究人工神经网络的基本传播函数，提出了二值化深度神经网络。这个网络是一个纯粹的二进制系统，其中所有的值和计算都是二元化的。因此，我们的网络可以节省大量的计算资源和存储空间。因此，可以在各种设备上使用它。此外，实验结果证明了该网络的可行性。
