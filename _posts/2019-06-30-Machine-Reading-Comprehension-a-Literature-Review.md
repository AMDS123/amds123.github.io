##### Abstract
Machine reading comprehension aims to teach machines to understand a text like a human and is a new challenging direction in Artificial Intelligence. This article summarizes recent advances in MRC, mainly focusing on two aspects (i.e., corpus and techniques). The specific characteristics of various MRC corpus are listed and compared. The main ideas of some typical MRC techniques are also described.
