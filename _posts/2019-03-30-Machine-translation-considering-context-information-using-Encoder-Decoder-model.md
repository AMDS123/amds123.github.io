##### Abstract
In the task of machine translation, context information is one of the important factor. But considering the context information model dose not proposed. The paper propose a new model which can integrate context information and make translation. In this paper, we create a new model based Encoder Decoder model. When translating current sentence, the model integrates output from preceding encoder with current encoder. The model can consider context information and the result score is higher than existing model.
