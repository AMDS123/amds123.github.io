##### Abstract
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a lung disease where early detection benefits the survival rate. COPD can be quantified by classifying patches of computed tomography images, and combining patch labels into an overall diagnosis for the image. As labeled patches are often not available, image labels are propagated to the patches, incorrectly labeling healthy patches in COPD patients as being affected by the disease. We approach quantification of COPD from lung images as a multiple instance learning (MIL) problem, which is more suitable for such weakly labeled data. We investigate various MIL assumptions in the context of COPD and show that although a concept region with COPD-related disease patterns is present, considering the whole distribution of lung tissue patches improves the performance. The best method is based on averaging instances and obtains an AUC of 0.742, which is higher than the previously reported best of 0.713 on the same dataset. Using the full training set further increases performance to 0.776, which is significantly higher (DeLong test) than previous results.

慢性阻塞性肺疾病（COPD）是早期发现有益于存活率的肺部疾病。 COPD可以通过对计算机断层扫描图像斑块进行分类并将斑块标记合并到图像的整体诊断中进行量化。由于经标记的贴片通常不可用，图像标签会传播到贴片上，从而错误地将COPD患者的健康贴片标记为受疾病影响。我们将肺部图像的COPD量化作为多实例学习（MIL）问题，这更适合于这种弱标记的数据。我们在COPD的背景下调查了各种MIL假设，并且显示尽管存在与COPD相关的疾病模式的概念区域，考虑到肺组织贴片的整体分布改善了性能。最好的方法是基于对实例进行平均并获得0.742的AUC，其高于之前在相同数据集上报告的最好0.713。使用完整的训练集进一步提高了0.776的性能，这比以前的结果显着更高（DeLong测试）。
