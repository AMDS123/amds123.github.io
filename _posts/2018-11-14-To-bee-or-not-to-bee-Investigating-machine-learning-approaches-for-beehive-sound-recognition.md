##### Abstract
In this work, we aim to explore the potential of machine learning methods to the problem of beehive sound recognition. A major contribution of this work is the creation and release of annotations for a selection of beehive recordings. By experimenting with both support vector machines and convolutional neural networks, we explore important aspects to be considered in the development of beehive sound recognition systems using machine learning approaches.
