##### Abstract
Robust features are of vital importance to face spoofing detection, because various situations make feature space extremely complicated to partition. Thus in this paper, two novel and robust features for anti-spoofing are proposed. The first one is a binocular camera based depth feature called Template Face Matched Binocular Depth (TFBD) feature. The second one is a high-level micro-texture based feature called Spatial Pyramid Coding Micro-Texture (SPMT) feature. Novel template face registration algorithm and spatial pyramid coding algorithm are also introduced along with the two novel features. Multi-modal face spoofing detection is implemented based on these two robust features. Experiments are conducted on a widely used dataset and a comprehensive dataset constructed by ourselves. The results reveal that face spoofing detection with the fusion of our proposed features is of strong robustness and time efficiency, meanwhile outperforming other state-of-the-art traditional methods.

强大的特征对于人脸欺骗检测至关重要，因为各种情况会使特征空间非常复杂。因此，在本文中，提出了两种新颖且强大的反欺骗功能。第一种是基于双目相机的深度特征，称为模板人脸匹配双目深度（TFBD）特征。第二个是基于高级微纹理的特征，称为空间金字塔编码微纹理（SPMT）特征。还介绍了新的模板人脸注册算法和空间金字塔编码算法以及两种新颖的特征。基于这两个强大的功能实现多模式人脸欺骗检测。对广泛使用的数据集和我们自己构建的综合数据集进行实验。结果表明，我们提出的特征融合的人脸欺骗检测具有很强的鲁棒性和时间效率，同时也超越了其他最先进的传统方法。
