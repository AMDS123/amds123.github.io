##### Abstract
Many modern NLP systems rely on word embeddings, previously trained in an unsupervised manner on large corpora, as base features. Efforts to obtain embeddings for larger chunks of text, such as sentences, have however not been so successful. Several attempts at learning unsupervised representations of sentences have not reached satisfactory enough performance to be widely adopted. In this paper, we show how universal sentence representations trained using the supervised data of the Stanford Natural Language Inference datasets can consistently outperform unsupervised methods like SkipThought vectors on a wide range of transfer tasks. Much like how computer vision uses ImageNet to obtain features, which can then be transferred to other tasks, our work tends to indicate the suitability of natural language inference for transfer learning to other NLP tasks. Our encoder is publicly available.

##### Abstract (translated by Google)
许多现代NLP系统依赖于先前以无监督方式在大型语料库上训练的词嵌入作为基本特征。然而，努力获得大块文本（比如句子）的嵌入，却并没有那么成功。多次尝试学习无监督表达的句子还没有达到令人满意的性能被广泛采用。在本文中，我们展示了如何使用斯坦福自然语言推理数据集的监督数据训练的全球性句子表示如何能够在广泛的传输任务上始终超越SkipThought向量等无监督方法。就像计算机视觉如何使用ImageNet获取特征，然后将其转移到其他任务一样，我们的工作倾向于指示自然语言推理对其他NLP任务的传递学习的适用性。我们的编码器是公开的。
