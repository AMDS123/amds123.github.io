##### Abstract
We present experimental measurements of the thermal boundary conductance (TBC) from $77 - 500$ K across isolated heteroepitaxially grown ZnO films on GaN substrates. These data provide an assessment of the assumptions that drive the phonon gas model-based diffuse mismatch models (DMM) and atomistic Green's function (AGF) formalisms for predicting TBC. Our measurements, when compared to previous experimental data, suggest that the TBC can be influenced by long wavelength, zone center modes in a material on one side of the interface as opposed to the "vibrational mismatch" concept assumed in the DMM; this disagreement is pronounced at high temperatures. At room temperature, we measure the ZnO/GaN TBC as $490\lbrack +150, -110\rbrack$ MW m$^{-2}$ K$^{-1}$. The disagreement among the DMM and AGF and the experimental data these elevated temperatures suggests a non-negligible contribution from additional modes contributing to TBC that not accounted for in the fundamental assumptions of these harmonic formalisms, such as inelastic scattering. Given the high quality of these ZnO/GaN interface, these results provide an invaluable critical and quantitive assessment of the accuracy of assumptions in the current state of the art of computational approaches for predicting the phonon TBC across interfaces.

我们提出在GaN衬底上隔离异质外延生长的ZnO薄膜的热边界电导（TBC）的实验测量值为77-500美元/ K。这些数据提供了驱动基于声子气模型的弥散失配模型（DMM）和原子格林函数（AGF）形式来预测TBC的假设的评估。与以前的实验数据相比，我们的测量表明TBC可以受到界面一侧的材料中的长波长，区域中心模式的影响，而不是DMM中假设的“振动失配”概念;这种分歧在高温下显着。在室温下，我们测量ZnO / GaN TBC为$ 490 \ lbrack +150，-110 \ rbrack $ MW m $ ^ { -  2} $ K $ ^ { -  1} $。 DMM和AGF之间的不一致以及实验数据表明，这些升高的温度表明TBC引起的附加模式贡献的不可忽略的贡献，这些贡献并没有在这些谐波形式的基本假设中考虑到，如非弹性散射。考虑到这些ZnO / GaN界面的高质量，这些结果提供了对用于预测界面上的声子TBC的计算方法的当前状态的假设的准确性的非常宝贵的关键和定量评估。
