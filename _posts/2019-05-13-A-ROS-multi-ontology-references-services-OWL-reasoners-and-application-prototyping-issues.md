##### Abstract
This paper introduces a ROS Multi Ontology References (ARMOR) service, a general-purpose and scalable interface between robot architectures and OWL reasoners. ARMOR addresses synchronisation and communication issues among heterogeneous and distributed software components. As a guiding scenario, we consider a prototyping approach for the use of symbolic reasoning in human-robot interaction applications.
