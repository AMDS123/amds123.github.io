##### Abstract
In recent years two sets of planar (2D) shape attributes, provided with an intuitive physical meaning, were proposed to the remote sensing community by, respectively, Nagao & Matsuyama and Shackelford & Davis in their seminal works on the increasingly popular geographic object based image analysis (GEOBIA) paradigm. These two published sets of intuitive geometric features were selected as initial conditions by the present R&D software project, whose multi-objective goal was to accomplish: (i) a minimally dependent and maximally informative design (knowledge/information representation) of a general purpose, user and application independent dictionary of 2D shape terms provided with a physical meaning intuitive to understand by human end users and (ii) an effective (accurate, scale invariant, easy to use) and efficient implementation of 2D shape descriptors. To comply with the Quality Assurance Framework for Earth Observation guidelines, the proposed suite of geometric functions is validated by means of a novel quantitative quality assurance policy, centered on inter feature dependence (causality) assessment. This innovative multivariate feature validation strategy is alternative to traditional feature selection procedures based on either inductive data learning classification accuracy estimation, which is inherently case specific, or cross correlation estimation, because statistical cross correlation does not imply causation. The project deliverable is an original general purpose software suite of seven validated off the shelf 2D shape descriptors intuitive to use. Alternative to existing commercial or open source software libraries of tens of planar shape functions whose informativeness remains unknown, it is eligible for use in (GE)OBIA systems in operating mode, expected to mimic human reasoning based on a convergence of evidence approach.

最近几年，分别由长尾松，沙克福德和戴维斯在日益流行的基于地理对象的图像的开创性工作中向遥感界提出了两套具有直观物理意义的平面（2D）形状属性分析（GEOBIA）范式。目前的研发软件项目选择了这两套公开发表的直观几何特征作为初始条件，其目的是为了实现：（i）通用目的的最小依赖性和最大信息性设计（知识/信息表示）用户和应用程序独立的2D形状术语词典，其物理意义直观易懂，并且（ii）2D形状描述符的有效（准确，尺度不变，易于使用）和有效的实现。为遵守“地球观测质量保证框架”指南，所提出的一系列几何函数通过一种以内部特征依赖（因果关系）评估为中心的新型量化质量保证政策来验证。这种创新的多变量特征验证策略是基于归纳数据学习分类准确性估计（本质上是特定于案例的）或互相关估计的传统特征选择过程的替代，因为统计互相关并不意味着因果关系。该项目交付是一个原始的通用软件套件，七个验证了现成的2D形状描述直观使用。替代现有商业或开源软件库的数十个平面形状功能，其信息性仍然未知，它是有资格使用（GE）的OBIA系统在操作模式，预计模仿基于证据收敛的人类推理方法。
