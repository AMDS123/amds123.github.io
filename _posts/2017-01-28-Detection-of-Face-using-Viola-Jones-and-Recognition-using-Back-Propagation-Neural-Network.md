##### Abstract
Detection and recognition of the facial images of people is an intricate problem which has garnered much attention during recent years due to its ever increasing applications in numerous fields. It continues to pose a challenge in finding a robust solution to it. Its scope extends to catering the security, commercial and law enforcement applications. Research for moreover a decade on this subject has brought about remarkable development with the modus operandi like human computer interaction, biometric analysis and content based coding of images, videos and surveillance. A trivial task for brain but cumbersome to be imitated artificially. The commonalities in faces does pose a problem on various grounds but features such as skin color, gender differentiate a person from the other. In this paper the facial detection has been carried out using Viola-Jones algorithm and recognition of face has been done using Back Propagation Neural Network (BPNN).

##### Abstract (translated by Google)
人脸图像的检测和识别是一个复杂的问题，近年来受到越来越多的关注，由于其在各个领域的应用越来越广泛。它继续对寻找一个强有力的解决方案构成挑战。其范围扩大到为安全，商业和执法应用提供服务。在这个问题上十年的研究，带来了人机交互，生物识别分析，图像内容编码，视频监控等手段的显着发展。大脑的一项微不足道的任务是人工模拟的麻烦。脸上的共同点确实在各种理由上都存在问题，但肤色，性别等因素却使得人与人之间存在差异。本文采用Viola-Jones算法进行人脸检测，并利用BP神经网络（BPNN）对人脸进行识别。
