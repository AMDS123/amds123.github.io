##### Abstract
In this work a systematic approach to the search for all-$sp^2$ bonded carbon allotropes with low density is presented. In particular, we obtain a number of novel energetically stable crystal structures, whose arrangement is closely related to the topology of graphene, by modifying the packing of congruent discs under the condition of local stability. Our procedure starts from an initial parent topology and proceeds to generate daughter architectures derived by lowering the packing factors. Furthermore, we assess both the electronic properties, such as the band structure and the density of states, and the mechanical properties, such as the elastic constants and the stress--strain characteristics, of parent's and daughter's geometries from first-principle simulations. We find, using geometrical packing arguments, that some arrangements lead to a density as low as half that of graphene, obtaining some of the least dense structures of all-$sp^2$ bonded carbon allotropes that could ever be synthesized. Nevertheless, a threshold value of the density exists below which the mechanical rigidity of graphene is irreparably lost, while keeping other mechanical characteristics, such as the specific toughness and strength, almost unchanged with lower weight.
