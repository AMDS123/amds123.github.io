##### Abstract
In recent years, various attempts have been proposed to explore the use of spatial and temporal information for human action recognition using convolutional neural networks (CNNs). However, only a small number of methods are available for the recognition of many human actions performed by more than one person in the same surveillance video. This paper proposes a novel technique for multiple human action recognition using a new architecture based on 3Dimdenisional deep learning with application to video surveillance systems. The first stage of the model uses a new representation of the data by extracting the sequence of each person acting in the scene. An analysis of each sequence to detect the corresponding actions is also proposed. KTH, Weizmann and UCF-ARG datasets were used for training, new datasets were also constructed which include a number of persons having multiple actions were used for testing the proposed algorithm. The results of this work revealed that the proposed method provides more accurate multi human action recognition achieving 98%. Other videos were used for the evaluation including datasets (UCF101, Hollywood2, HDMB51, and YouTube) without any preprocessing and the results obtained suggest that our proposed method clearly improves the performances when compared to state-of-the-art methods.
