##### Abstract
Person re-identification (re-id) is the task of recognizing and matching persons at different locations recorded by cameras with non-overlapping views. One of the main challenges of re-id is the large variance in person poses and camera angles since neither of them can be influenced by the re-id system. In this work, an effective approach to integrate coarse camera view information as well as fine-grained pose information into a convolutional neural network (CNN) model for learning discriminative re-id embeddings is introduced. In most recent work pose information is either explicitly modeled within the re-id system or explicitly used for pre-processing, for example by pose-normalizing person images. In contrast, the proposed approach shows that a direct use of camera view as well as the detected body joint locations into a standard CNN can be used to significantly improve the robustness of learned re-id embeddings. On four challenging surveillance and video re-id datasets significant improvements over the current state of the art have been achieved. Furthermore, a novel reordering of the MARS dataset, called X-MARS is introduced to allow cross-validation of models trained for single-image re-id on tracklet data.

人员重新识别（重新识别）是识别和匹配不重叠视图的摄像机记录的不同位置人员的任务。 re-id的主要挑战之一是人物姿态和摄像机角度的巨大差异，因为它们都不会受re-id系统的影响。在这项工作中，介绍了一种有效的方法来将粗略的相机视图信息和细粒度姿态信息整合到用于学习区分性重新嵌入的卷积神经网络（CNN）模型中。在最近的工作中，姿势信息或者在重新识别系统内被明确地建模，或者明确地用于预处理，例如通过姿势规范化人员图像。相反，所提出的方法表明，将相机视图以及检测到的身体关节位置直接用于标准CNN可以用于显着提高所学习的re-id嵌入的鲁棒性。在四个具有挑战性的监控和视频重新标识数据集上，已经实现了对当前技术水平的重大改进。此外，引入了MARS数据集的一种新的重新排序，称为X-MARS，以允许在轨迹数据上针对单图像重新识别训练的模型进行交叉验证。
