##### Abstract
Ticket assignment/dispatch is a crucial part of service delivery business with lot of scope for automation and optimization. In this paper, we present an end-to-end automated helpdesk email ticket assignment system, which is also offered as a service. The objective of the system is to determine the nature of the problem mentioned in an incoming email ticket and then automatically dispatch it to an appropriate resolver group (or team) for resolution. 
 The proposed system uses an ensemble classifier augmented with a configurable rule engine. While design of classifier that is accurate is one of the main challenges, we also need to address the need of designing a system that is robust and adaptive to changing business needs. We discuss some of the main design challenges associated with email ticket assignment automation and how we solve them. The design decisions for our system are driven by high accuracy, coverage, business continuity, scalability and optimal usage of computational resources. 
 Our system has been deployed in production of three major service providers and currently assigning over 40,000 emails per month, on an average, with an accuracy close to 90% and covering at least 90% of email tickets. This translates to achieving human-level accuracy and results in a net saving of about 23000 man-hours of effort per annum.

票务分配/发送是服务交付业务的重要组成部分，具有很多自动化和优化的范围。在本文中，我们提供了一个端到端的自动服务台电子邮件分配系统，该系统也作为服务提供。该系统的目的是确定传入电子邮件票据中提到的问题的性质，然后自动将其分派给适当的解析器组（或团队）进行解决。
 所提出的系统使用增强了可配置规则引擎的集合分类器。虽然准确的分类器设计是主要挑战之一，但我们还需要满足设计一个强大且适应不断变化的业务需求的系统的需求。我们将讨论与电子邮件分配自动化相关的一些主要设计挑战以及我们如何解决这些挑战。我们系统的设计决策受到高精度，覆盖范围，业务连续性，可扩展性和计算资源的最佳使用的驱动。
 我们的系统已部署在三大服务提供商的生产中，目前平均每月分配超过40,000封电子邮件，准确率接近90％，并且至少覆盖90％的电子邮件票据。这意味着实现人类级别的准确性，每年可节省大约23000个工时的工作量。
