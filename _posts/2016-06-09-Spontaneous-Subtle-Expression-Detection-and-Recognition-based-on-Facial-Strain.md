##### Abstract
Optical strain is an extension of optical flow that is capable of quantifying subtle changes on faces and representing the minute facial motion intensities at the pixel level. This is computationally essential for the relatively new field of spontaneous micro-expression, where subtle expressions can be technically challenging to pinpoint. In this paper, we present a novel method for detecting and recognizing micro-expressions by utilizing facial optical strain magnitudes to construct optical strain features and optical strain weighted features. The two sets of features are then concatenated to form the resultant feature histogram. Experiments were performed on the CASME II and SMIC databases. We demonstrate on both databases, the usefulness of optical strain information and more importantly, that our best approaches are able to outperform the original baseline results for both detection and recognition tasks. A comparison of the proposed method with other existing spatio-temporal feature extraction approaches is also presented.

光学应变是光流的延伸，能够量化面部上的细微变化并代表像素级的微小面部运动强度。这对于自发性微表达的相对新的领域来说是计算上必不可少的，其中微妙的表达在技术上可能难以查明。在本文中，我们提出了一种利用面部光学应变量来构造光学应变特征和光学应变加权特征的微型表达的检测和识别方法。然后将两组特征串联起来形成结果特征直方图。在CASME II和SMIC数据库上进行实验。我们在这两个数据库上展示了光学应变信息的有用性，更重要的是，我们的最佳方法能够胜过检测和识别任务的原始基线结果。提出了该方法与其他现有时空特征提取方法的比较。
