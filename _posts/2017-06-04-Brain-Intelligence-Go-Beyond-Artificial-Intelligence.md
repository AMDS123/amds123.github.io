##### Abstract
Artificial intelligence (AI) is an important technology that supports daily social life and economic activities. It contributes greatly to the sustainable growth of Japan's economy and solves various social problems. In recent years, AI has attracted attention as a key for growth in developed countries such as Europe and the United States and developing countries such as China and India. The attention has been focused mainly on developing new artificial intelligence information communication technology (ICT) and robot technology (RT). Although recently developed AI technology certainly excels in extracting certain patterns, there are many limitations. Most ICT models are overly dependent on big data, lack a self-idea function, and are complicated. In this paper, rather than merely developing next-generation artificial intelligence technology, we aim to develop a new concept of general-purpose intelligence cognition technology called Beyond AI. Specifically, we plan to develop an intelligent learning model called Brain Intelligence (BI) that generates new ideas about events without having experienced them by using artificial life with an imagine function. We will also conduct demonstrations of the developed BI intelligence learning model on automatic driving, precision medical care, and industrial robots.

人工智能（AI）是支持日常社交生活和经济活动的重要技术。它为日本经济的可持续发展做出了巨大贡献，解决了各种社会问题。近年来，人工智能作为欧美等发达国家和中国，印度等发展中国家的发展重点，受到关注。主要关注于开发新的人工智能信息通信技术（ICT）和机器人技术（RT）。尽管最近开发的AI技术在提取某些模式方面确实擅长，但是有许多限制。大多数信息通信技术模式过分依赖大数据，缺乏自我意识的功能，而且是复杂的。本文不是单纯地开发下一代人工智能技术，而是开发一种名为Beyond AI的通用智能认知技术的新概念。具体而言，我们计划开发一种名为脑智能（BI）的智能学习模型，通过使用具有想象功能的人工生命来体验新事物，而不用经历它们。我们还将对自动驾驶，精密医疗和工业机器人开发的BI智能学习模型进行演示。
