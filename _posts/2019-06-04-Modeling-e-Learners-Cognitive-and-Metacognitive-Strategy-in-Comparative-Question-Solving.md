##### Abstract
Cognitive and metacognitive strategy had demonstrated a significant role in self-regulated learning (SRL), and an appropriate use of strategies is beneficial to effective learning or question-solving tasks during a human-computer interaction process. This paper proposes a novel method combining Knowledge Map (KM) based data mining technique with Thinking Map (TM) to detect learner's cognitive and metacognitive strategy in the question-solving scenario. In particular, a graph-based mining algorithm is designed to facilitate our proposed method, which can automatically map cognitive strategy to metacognitive strategy with raising abstraction level, and make the cognitive and metacognitive process viewable, which acts like a reverse engineering engine to explain how a learner thinks when solving a question. Additionally, we develop an online learning environment system for participants to learn and record their behaviors. To corroborate the effectiveness of our approach and algorithm, we conduct experiments recruiting 173 postgraduate and undergraduate students, and they were asked to complete a question-solving task, such as "What are similarities and differences between array and pointer?" from "The C Programming Language" course and "What are similarities and differences between packet switching and circuit switching?" from "Computer Network Principle" course. The mined strategies patterns results are encouraging and supported well our proposed method.
