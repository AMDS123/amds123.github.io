##### Abstract
In this paper we present an efficient implementation using triplet loss for face recognition. We conduct the practical experiment to analyze the factors that influence the training of triplet loss. All models are trained on CASIA-Webface dataset and tested on LFW. We analyze the experiment results and give some insights to help others balance the factors when they apply triplet loss to their own problem especially for face recognition task. Code has been released in https://github.com/yule-li/MassFace.
