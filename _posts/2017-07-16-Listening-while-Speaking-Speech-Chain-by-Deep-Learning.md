##### Abstract
Despite the close relationship between speech perception and production, research in automatic speech recognition (ASR) and text-to-speech synthesis (TTS) has progressed more or less independently without exerting much mutual influence on each other. In human communication, on the other hand, a closed-loop speech chain mechanism with auditory feedback from the speaker's mouth to her ear is crucial. In this paper, we take a step further and develop a closed-loop speech chain model based on deep learning. The sequence-to-sequence model in close-loop architecture allows us to train our model on the concatenation of both labeled and unlabeled data. While ASR transcribes the unlabeled speech features, TTS attempts to reconstruct the original speech waveform based on the text from ASR. In the opposite direction, ASR also attempts to reconstruct the original text transcription given the synthesized speech. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first deep learning model that integrates human speech perception and production behaviors. Our experimental results show that the proposed approach significantly improved the performance more than separate systems that were only trained with labeled data.

##### Abstract (translated by Google)
尽管语音感知与生产之间有着密切的关系，但是自动语音识别（ASR）和文本语音合成（TTS）的研究或多或少都是独立进行的，彼此之间没有太大的相互影响。另一方面，在人际交流中，从说话者的嘴到耳朵的听觉反馈的闭环语音链机制是至关重要的。在本文中，我们进一步发展了一个基于深度学习的闭环语音链模型。闭环结构中的序列到序列模型允许我们在标记和未标记数据串联的情况下训练我们的模型。当ASR转录未标记的语音特征时，TTS尝试基于来自ASR的文本重建原始语音波形。在相反的方向，ASR也试图重新构造给出合成语音的原始文本转录。就我们所知，这是第一个融合了人类言语知觉和生产行为的深度学习模式。我们的实验结果表明，所提出的方法比单独使用标记数据训练的系统更能显着提高性能。
