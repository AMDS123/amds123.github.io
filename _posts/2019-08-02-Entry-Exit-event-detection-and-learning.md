##### Abstract
The notion of Entry-Exit Surveillance provides scope for monitoring subjects entering and exiting 'private areas' (places such as wash rooms and changing rooms where cameras are forbidden). The proposal here is to design a conceptual model that accurately detects the type of event such as entry/exit of subjects at the entrances and is robust to possible occlusions between subjects. A novel Entry-Exit event detection method that analyzes the three dimensional layout of the camera view as well as the transition of subjects through frames and determines the type of event as entry or exit or miscellaneous is presented in this paper. Extensive experiments on the benchmark EnEx,CAVIAR and PAMELA-UANDES datasets demonstrate the efficacy of the model.
