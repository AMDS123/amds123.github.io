##### Abstract
Computer Vision is growing day by day in terms of user specific applications. The first step of any such application is segmenting an image. In this paper, we propose a novel and grass-root level image segmentation algorithm for cases in which the background has uniform color distribution. This algorithm can be used for images of flowers, birds, insects and many more where such background conditions occur. By image segmentation, the visualization of a computer increases manifolds and it can even attain near-human accuracy during classification.

计算机视觉在用户特定的应用方面日益增长。任何这样的应用的第一步是分割图像。本文针对背景颜色分布均匀的情况，提出了一种新的基层图像分割算法。这种算法可以用于花卉，鸟类，昆虫等图像的背景情况发生。通过图像分割，计算机的可视化增加了流形，在分类过程中甚至可以达到接近人类的精度。
