##### Abstract
The ability to accurately identify human activities is essential for developing automatic rehabilitation and sports training systems. In this paper, large-scale exercise motion data obtained from a forearm-worn wearable sensor are classified with a convolutional neural network (CNN). Time-series data consisting of accelerometer and orientation measurements are formatted as images, allowing the CNN to automatically extract discriminative features. A comparative study on the effects of image formatting and different CNN architectures is also presented. The best performing configuration classifies 50 gym exercises with 92.1% accuracy.

准确识别人类活动的能力对于开发自动康复和运动训练系统至关重要。在本文中，从前臂佩戴的可穿戴传感器获得的大规模锻炼运动数据被分类为卷积神经网络（CNN）。由加速度计和方位测量组成的时间序列数据被格式化为图像，允许CNN自动提取区分性特征。还介绍了图像格式化和不同CNN体系结构的效果对比研究。表现最好的配置分类为50次健身运动，精确度为92.1％。
