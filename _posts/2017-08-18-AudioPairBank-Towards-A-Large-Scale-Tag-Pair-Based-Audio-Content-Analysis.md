##### Abstract
Recently, sound recognition has been used to identify sounds, such as car and river. However, sounds have nuances that may be better described by adjective-noun pairs such as slow car, and verb-noun pairs such as flying insects, which are under explored. Therefore, in this work we investigate the relation between audio content and both adjective-noun pairs and verb-noun pairs. Due to a lack of datasets with these kinds of annotations, we collected and processed the AudioPairBank corpus consisting of a combined total of 1,123 pairs and over 33,000 audio files. One contribution is the previously unavailable documentation of the challenges and implications of collecting audio recordings with these type of labels. A second contribution is to show the degree of correlation between the audio content and the labels through sound recognition experiments, which yielded results of 70% accuracy, hence also providing a performance benchmark. The conclusions in this paper encourage further exploration of the nuances in audio and are meant to complement similar research performed on images and text in multimedia analysis.

最近，声音识别已被用于识别声音，如汽车和河流。然而，声音有细微差别，可以用形容词 - 名词对（比如慢车）和动词 - 名词对（比如飞行昆虫）更好地描述，正在探索之中。因此，在这项工作中，我们调查音频内容与形容词 - 名词对和动词 - 名词对之间的关​​系。由于缺少具有这些注释的数据集，我们收集并处理了AudioPairBank语料库，该语料库由总共1,123对和超过33,000个音频文件组成。其中一个贡献是之前无法收集使用这些类型标签录音的挑战和影响的文件。第二个贡献是通过声音识别实验来显示音频内容和标签之间的相关程度，这产生了70％的准确度结果，因此也提供了性能基准。本文的结论鼓励对音频细节的进一步探索，旨在补充在多媒体分析中对图像和文本进行类似的研究。
