##### Abstract
Statistical models have been successful in accurately estimating the biochemical contents of vegetation from the reflectance spectra. However, their performance deteriorates when there is a scarcity of sizable amount of ground truth data for modeling the complex non-linear relationship occurring between the spectrum and the biochemical quantity. We propose a novel Gaussian process based multitask learning method for improving the prediction of a biochemical through the transfer of knowledge from the learned models for predicting related biochemicals. This method is most advantageous when there are few ground truth data for the biochemical of interest, but plenty of ground truth data for related biochemicals. The proposed multitask Gaussian process hypothesizes that the inter-relationship between the biochemical quantities is better modeled by using a combination of two or more covariance functions and inter-task correlation matrices. In the experiments, our method outperformed the current methods on two real-world datasets.

统计模型已经成功地从反射光谱中精确估计植被的生化含量。然而，当缺乏大量的地面实况数据来模拟光谱与生化量之间复杂的非线性关系时，其性能会恶化。我们提出了一种新的基于高斯过程的多任务学习方法，通过从相关生物化学物质预测学习模型的知识转移，改善生化预测。这种方法是最有利的，当有关的生物化学的地面实况数据很少，但相关的生物化学的大量的地面实况数据。所提出的多任务高斯过程假设通过使用两个或更多个协方差函数和任务间相关矩阵的组合来更好地建模生化量之间的相互关系。在实验中，我们的方法在两个真实世界的数据集上胜过了目前的方法。
