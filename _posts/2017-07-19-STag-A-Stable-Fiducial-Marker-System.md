##### Abstract
In this paper, we propose STag, a fiducial marker system that provides stable pose estimation. The outer square border of the marker is used for detection and pose estimation. This is followed by a novel pose refinement step using the inner circular border. The refined pose is more stable and robust across viewing conditions compared to the state of the art. In addition, the lexicographic generation algorithm is adapted for fiducial markers, and libraries with various sizes are created. This makes the system suitable for applications that require many unique markers, or few unique markers with high occlusion resistance. The edge segment-based detection algorithm is of low complexity, and returns few false candidates. These features are demonstrated with experiments on real images, including comparisons with the state of the art fiducial marker systems.

##### Abstract (translated by Google)
在本文中，我们提出了STag，一个提供稳定的姿态估计的基准标记系统。标记的外部正方形边界用于检测和姿态估计。接下来是使用内部圆形边界的新颖姿态细化步骤。与现有技术相比，改进的姿势在观看条件下更加稳定和健壮。此外，字典生成算法适用于基准标记，并创建了各种大小的库。这使得该系统适用于需要许多独特标记的应用，或者几个具有高阻塞性的独特标记。基于边缘段的检测算法复杂度低，返回的候选假数较少。这些特征通过对实际图像的实验来展示，包括与现有技术的基准标记系统的比较。
