##### Abstract
To harness the complexity of their high-dimensional bodies during sensorimotor development, infants are guided by patterns of freezing and freeing of degrees of freedom. For instance, when learning to reach, infants free the degrees of freedom in their arm proximodistally, i.e. from joints that are closer to the body to those that are more distant. Here, we formulate and study computationally the hypothesis that such patterns can emerge spontaneously as the result of a family of stochastic optimization processes (evolution strategies with covariance-matrix adaptation), without an innate encoding of a maturational schedule. In particular, we present simulated experiments with an arm where a computational learner progressively acquires reaching skills through adaptive exploration, and we show that a proximodistal organization appears spontaneously, which we denote PDFF (ProximoDistal Freezing and Freeing of degrees of freedom). We also compare this emergent organization between different arm morphologies -- from human-like to quite unnatural ones -- to study the effect of different kinematic structures on the emergence of PDFF. Keywords: human motor learning; proximo-distal exploration; stochastic optimization; modelling; evolution strategies; cross-entropy methods; policy search; morphology.}

##### Abstract (translated by Google)
在感觉运动发育期间，为了利用其高维体的复杂性，婴儿以冷冻和释放自由度的模式为指导。例如，当学习到达婴儿的时候，婴儿的手臂的近侧自由度即从更接近身体的关节到更远的关节释放自由度。在这里，我们计算和研究这样一个假设，即这种模式可以作为一个随机优化过程（具有协方差矩阵适应的进化策略）的结果而自发产生，而不需要一个成熟的时间表的固有编码。特别地，我们用一个手臂进行模拟实验，计算学习者通过适应性探索逐渐获取到达技能，并且我们表明一个近似的组织自发出现，我们表示PDFF（ProximoDistal Freezing and Freeing of degree of freedom）。我们也比较了不同手臂形态之间的这种紧急组织 - 从人类到非常自然的 - 研究不同运动结构对PDFF出现的影响。关键词：人体运动学习;近远端探查;随机优化;造型;进化策略;交叉熵方法;政策搜索;形态学。}
