##### Abstract
Recently, with the revolutionary neural style transferring methods, creditable paintings can be synthesized automatically from content images and style images. However, when it comes to the task of applying a painting's style to an anime sketch, these methods will just randomly colorize sketch lines as outputs and fail in the main task: specific style tranfer. In this paper, we integrated residual U-net to apply the style to the gray-scale sketch with auxiliary classifier generative adversarial network (AC-GAN). The whole process is automatic and fast, and the results are creditable in the quality of art style as well as colorization.

最近，随着革命性的神经风格转换方法，可信的绘画可以从内容图像和风格图像自动合成。但是，当将绘画风格应用于动画素描时，这些方法将随机将作为输出的草图线着色，并在主要任务中失败：特定风格的转移。本文将残差U网融合到辅助分类生成对抗网络（AC-GAN）的灰度图上。整个过程自动快速，结果在艺术品质和色彩上都是可信的。
