##### Abstract
Sponsored search represents a major source of revenue for web search engines. This popular advertising model brings a unique possibility for advertisers to target users' immediate intent communicated through a search query, usually by displaying their ads alongside organic search results for queries deemed relevant to their products or services. However, due to a large number of unique queries it is challenging for advertisers to identify all such relevant queries. For this reason search engines often provide a service of advanced matching, which automatically finds additional relevant queries for advertisers to bid on. We present a novel advanced matching approach based on the idea of semantic embeddings of queries and ads. The embeddings were learned using a large data set of user search sessions, consisting of search queries, clicked ads and search links, while utilizing contextual information such as dwell time and skipped ads. To address the large-scale nature of our problem, both in terms of data and vocabulary size, we propose a novel distributed algorithm for training of the embeddings. Finally, we present an approach for overcoming a cold-start problem associated with new ads and queries. We report results of editorial evaluation and online tests on actual search traffic. The results show that our approach significantly outperforms baselines in terms of relevance, coverage, and incremental revenue. Lastly, we open-source learned query embeddings to be used by researchers in computational advertising and related fields.

赞助商搜索是网络搜索引擎的主要收入来源。这种流行的广告模式为广告商带来了一种独特的可能性，即通过搜索查询来定位用户的即时意图，通常通过将自己的广告展示在与自己的产品或服务相关的查询的有机搜索结果旁边。但是，由于大量独特的查询，广告商难以确定所有这些相关的查询。由于这个原因，搜索引擎经常提供高级匹配服务，自动为广告商提供额外的相关查询。基于查询和广告语义嵌入的思想，我们提出了一种新颖的高级匹配方法。使用大量的用户搜索会话数据集来学习嵌入，包括搜索查询，点击广告和搜索链接，同时利用停留时间和跳过广告等上下文信息。为了解决我们的问题的大规模性，无论是在数据和词汇量方面，我们提出了一种新的分布式嵌入算法。最后，我们介绍克服与新广告和查询相关的冷启动问题的方法。我们报告实际搜索流量的编辑评估和在线测试的结果。结果显示，我们的方法在相关性，覆盖范围和增量收入方面明显优于基线。最后，我们开源学习查询嵌入，供计算广告和相关领域的研究人员使用。
