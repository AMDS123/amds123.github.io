##### Abstract
This paper discusses the trapezoidal fuzzy number(TrFN); Interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy number(IVIFN); neutrosophic set and its operational laws; and, trapezoidal neutrosophic set(TrNS) and its operational laws. Based on the combination of IVIFN and TrNS, an Interval Valued Trapezoidal Neutrosophic Set (IVTrNS) is proposed followed by its operational laws. The paper also presents the score and accuracy functions for the proposed Interval Valued Trapezoidal Neutrosophic Number (IVTrNN). Then, an interval valued trapezoidal neutrosophic weighted arithmetic averaging (IVTrNWAA) operator is introduced to combine the trapezoidal information which is neutrosophic and in the unit interval of real numbers. Finally, a method is developed to handle the problems in the multi attribute decision making(MADM) environment using IVTrNWAA operator followed by a numerical example of NFRs prioritization to illustrate the relevance of the developed method.
