##### Abstract
Nearest neighbor search is known as a challenging issue that has been studied for several decades. Recently, this issue becomes more and more imminent in viewing that the big data problem arises from various fields. In this paper, a scalable solution based on hill-climbing strategy with the support of k-nearest neighbor graph (kNN) is presented. Two major issues have been considered in the paper. Firstly, an efficient kNN graph construction method based on two means tree is presented. For the nearest neighbor search, an enhanced hill-climbing procedure is proposed, which sees considerable performance boost over original procedure. Furthermore, with the support of inverted indexing derived from residue vector quantization, our method achieves close to 100% recall with high speed efficiency in two state-of-the-art evaluation benchmarks. In addition, a comparative study on both the compressional and traditional nearest neighbor search methods is presented. We show that our method achieves the best trade-off between search quality, efficiency and memory complexity.

最近邻搜索被认为是一个已经研究了几十年的具有挑战性的问题。最近，这个问题越来越迫切地认识到大数据问题来自各个领域。本文提出了一种基于爬山策略的可扩展解决方案，并在k-最近邻图（kNN）的支持下，本文考虑了两个主要问题。首先，提出了一种基于二叉树的高效kNN图的构造方法。对于最近邻搜索，提出了一个增强的爬山程序，与原来的程序相比，性能得到了相当大的提升。此外，在残差向量量化的倒排索引的支持下，我们的方法在两个最先进的评估基准中，以高速效率达到接近100％的回忆。另外还介绍了压缩传统最近邻搜索方法和传统最近邻搜索方法的比较研究。我们表明，我们的方法实现了搜索质量，效率和内存复杂度之间的最佳平衡。
