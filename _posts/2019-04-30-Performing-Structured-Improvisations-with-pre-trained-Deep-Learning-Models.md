##### Abstract
The quality of outputs produced by deep generative models for music have seen a dramatic improvement in the last few years. However, most deep learning models perform in "offline" mode, with few restrictions on the processing time. Integrating these types of models into a live structured performance poses a challenge because of the necessity to respect the beat and harmony. Further, these deep models tend to be agnostic to the style of a performer, which often renders them impractical for live performance. In this paper we propose a system which enables the integration of out-of-the-box generative models by leveraging the musician's creativity and expertise.
