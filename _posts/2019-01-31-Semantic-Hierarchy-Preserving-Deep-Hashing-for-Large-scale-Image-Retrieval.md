##### Abstract
Convolutional neural networks have been widely used in content-based image retrieval. To better deal with large-scale data, the deep hashing model is proposed as an effective method, which maps an image to a binary code that can be used for hashing search. However, most existing deep hashing models only utilize fine-level semantic labels or convert them to similar/dissimilar labels for training. The natural semantic hierarchy structures are ignored in the training stage of the deep hashing model. In this paper, we present an effective algorithm to train a deep hashing model that can preserve a semantic hierarchy structure for large-scale image retrieval. Experiments on two datasets show that our method improves the fine-level retrieval performance. Meanwhile, our model achieves state-of-the-art results in terms of hierarchical retrieval.
