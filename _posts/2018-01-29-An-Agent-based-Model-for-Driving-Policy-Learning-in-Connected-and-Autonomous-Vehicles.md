##### Abstract
Due to the complexity of the natural world, a programmer cannot foresee all possible situations a connected and autonomous vehicle (CAV) will face during its operation, and hence, CAVs will need to learn to make decisions autonomously. Due to the sensing of its surroundings and information exchanged with other vehicles and road infrastructure a CAV will have access to large amounts of useful data. This paper investigates a data driven driving policy learning framework through an agent based learning. A reinforcement learning framework is presented in the paper, which simulates the self-evolution of a CAV over its lifetime. The results indicated that overtime the CAVs are able to learn useful policies to avoid crashes and achieve its objectives in more efficient ways. Vehicle to vehicle communication in particular, enables additional useful information to be acquired by CAVs, which in turn enables CAVs to learn driving policies more efficiently. The simulation results indicate that while a CAV can learn to make autonomous decision V2V communication of information improves this capability. The future work will investigate complex driving policies such as roundabout negotiations, cooperative learning between CAVs and deep reinforcement learning to traverse larger state spaces.

由于自然界的复杂性，程序员不可能预见连接自主车辆（CAV）在运行过程中将面临的所有可能情况，因此CAV需要学习自主决策。由于感知周围的环境，并与其他车辆和道路基础设施交换信息，CAV将获得大量有用的数据。本文通过一个基于代理的学习来研究一个数据驱动的驾驶策略学习框架。本文提出了强化学习框架，它模拟CAV在其整个生命周期中的自我演化。结果表明加班CAV能够学习有用的政策，以避免崩溃，并以更有效的方式实现其目标。特别是车辆到车辆的通信使得CAV可以获得更多有用的信息，从而使CAV更有效地学习驾驶策略。仿真结果表明，虽然一个CAV可以学习做出自主决定，但是V2V通信信息提高了这种能力。未来的工作将研究复杂的驾驶政策，如环岛交通谈判，CAV之间的合作学习以及深入的强化学习以穿越更大的国家空间。
