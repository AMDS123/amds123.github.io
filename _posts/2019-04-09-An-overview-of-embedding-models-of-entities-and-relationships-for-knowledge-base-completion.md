##### Abstract
Knowledge bases (KBs) of real-world facts about entities and their relationships are useful resources for a variety of natural language processing tasks. However, because knowledge bases are typically incomplete, it is useful to be able to perform knowledge base completion or link prediction, i.e., predict whether a relationship not in the knowledge base is likely to be true. This article serves as a brief overview of embedding models of entities and relationships for knowledge base completion, summarizing up-to-date experimental results on standard benchmark datasets FB15k, WN18, FB15k-237, WN18RR, FB13 and WN11.
