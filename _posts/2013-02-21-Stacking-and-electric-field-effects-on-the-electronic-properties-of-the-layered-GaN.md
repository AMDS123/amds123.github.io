##### Abstract
Stability and electronic properties of atomic layers of GaN are investigated in the framework of the van der Waals-density functional theory. We find that the ground state of the layered GaN is a planar graphene-like configuration rather than a buckled bulk-like configuration. Application of an external perpendicular electric field to the layered GaN induces distinct stacking-dependent features of the tunability of the band gap; the band gap of the monolayer does not change whereas that of the trilayer GaN is significantly reduced for the applied field of 0.4 V/ {\AA}. It is suggested that such a stacking-dependent tunability of the band gap in the presence of an applied field may lead to novel applications of the devices based on the layered GaN.

##### Abstract (translated by Google)
研究了范德华密度泛函理论框架下GaN原子层的稳定性和电子性质。我们发现，分层GaN的基态是平面石墨烯状结构，而不是褶皱的块状结构。将外部垂直电场施加到分层的GaN引起带隙可调谐性的不同叠层相关特征;单层的带隙不改变，而三层GaN的带隙对于0.4V / {\ AA}的施加场显着减小。建议在存在施加电场的情况下带隙的这种依赖堆叠的可调性可能导致基于分层GaN的器件的新应用。
