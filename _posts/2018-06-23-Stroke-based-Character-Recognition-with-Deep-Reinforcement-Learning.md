##### Abstract
The stroke sequence of characters is significant for the character recognition task. In this paper, we propose a stroke-based character recognition (SCR) method. We train a stroke inference module under deep reinforcement learning (DRL) framework. This module extracts the sequence of strokes from characters, which can be integrated with character recognizers to improve their robustness to noise. Our experiments show that the module can handle complicated noise and reconstruct the characters. Meanwhile, it can also help achieve great ability in defending adversarial attacks of character recognizers.

字符的笔画序列对于字符识别任务是重要的。在本文中，我们提出了一种基于笔划的字符识别（SCR）方法。我们在深度强化学习（DRL）框架下训练中风推理模块。该模块从字符中提取笔划序列，可与字符识别器集成以提高其对噪声的鲁棒性。我们的实验表明，该模块可以处理复杂的噪音并重构人物。同时，它还可以帮助我们在防御角色识别器的敌对攻击方面做出巨大的贡献。
