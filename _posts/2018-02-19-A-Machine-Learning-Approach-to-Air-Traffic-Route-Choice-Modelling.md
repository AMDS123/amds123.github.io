##### Abstract
Air Traffic Flow and Capacity Management (ATFCM) is one of the constituent parts of Air Traffic Management (ATM). The goal of ATFCM is to make airport and airspace capacity meet traffic demand and, when capacity opportunities are exhausted, optimise traffic flows to meet the available capacity. One of the key enablers of ATFCM is the accurate estimation of future traffic demand. The available information (schedules, flight plans, etc.) and its associated level of uncertainty differ across the different ATFCM planning phases, leading to qualitative differences between the types of forecasting that are feasible at each time horizon. While abundant research has been conducted on tactical trajectory prediction (i.e., during the day of operations), trajectory prediction in the pre-tactical phase, when few or no flight plans are available, has received much less attention. As a consequence, the methods currently in use for pre-tactical traffic forecast are still rather rudimentary, often resulting in suboptimal ATFCM decision making. This paper proposes a machine learning approach for the prediction of airlines route choices between two airports as a function of route characteristics, such as flight efficiency, air navigation charges and expected level of congestion. Different predictive models based on multinomial logistic regression and decision trees are formulated and calibrated with historical traffic data, and a critical evaluation of each model is conducted. We analyse the predictive power of each model in terms of its ability to forecast traffic volumes at the level of charging zones, proving significant potential to enhance pre-tactical traffic forecast. We conclude by discussing the limitations and room for improvement of the proposed approach, as well as the future developments required to produce reliable traffic forecasts at a higher spatial and temporal resolution.

空中交通流量和容量管理（ATFCM）是空中交通管理（ATM）的组成部分之一。 ATFCM的目标是使机场和空域容量满足交通需求，当容量机会耗尽时，优化交通流量以满足可用容量。 ATFCM的关键推动力之一是对未来交通需求的准确估计。可用信息（时间表，飞行计划等）及其相关的不确定性水平在不同的ATFCM规划阶段有所不同，导致在各个时间范围内可行的预测类型之间存在质的差异。尽管已经对战术轨迹预测进行了大量的研究（即在作战当天），但是在战术前阶段的轨迹预测很少或者没有可用的飞行计划，因此受到的关注较少。因此，目前用于战术前交通预测的方法仍然相当简陋，往往导致次优ATFCM决策。本文提出了一种机器学习方法，用于预测两个机场之间的航空公司航线选择，作为航线特征（例如飞行效率，空中导航收费和预期拥堵程度）的函数。根据多项逻辑回归和决策树制定不同的预测模型并使用历史交通数据进行校准，并对每个模型进行关键评估。我们分析了每个模型在预测收费区级别的交通量预测能力方面的预测能力，证明了增强预战术交通预测的巨大潜力。最后，我们将讨论提议方法的局限性和改进空间，以及以更高的空间和时间分辨率生成可靠的交通预测所需的未来发展。
