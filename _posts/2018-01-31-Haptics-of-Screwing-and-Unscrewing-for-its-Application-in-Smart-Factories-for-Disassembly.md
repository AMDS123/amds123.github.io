##### Abstract
Reconstruction of skilled humans sensation and control system often leads to a development of robust control for the robots. We are developing an unscrewing robot for the automated disassembly which requires a comprehensive control system, but unscrewing experiments with robots are often limited to several conditions. On the contrary, humans typically have a broad range of screwing experiences and sensations throughout their lives, and we conducted an experiment to find these haptic patterns. Results show that people apply axial force to the screws to avoid screwdriver slippage (cam-outs), which is one of the key problems during screwing and unscrewing, and this axial force is proportional to the torque which is required for screwing. We have found that type of the screw head influences the amount of axial force applied. Using this knowledge an unscrewing robot for the smart disassembly factory RecyBot is developed, and experiments confirm the optimality of the strategy, used by humans. Finally, a methodology for robust unscrewing algorithm design is presented as a generalization of the findings. It can seriously speed up the development of the screwing and unscrewing robots and tools.

熟练的人类感觉和控制系统的重建通常导致对机器人的鲁棒控制的发展。我们正在开发一种需要全面控制系统的自动拆卸机器人，但是用机器人拧松实验往往局限于几个条件。相反，人类通常在整个生活中都有广泛的拧紧经验和感受，我们进行了一个实验来寻找这些触觉模式。结果表明，人们对螺丝施加轴向力，以避免螺丝起子滑脱（凸出），这是螺丝拧松过程中的关键问题之一，该轴向力与螺丝所需的转矩成正比。我们发现螺丝头的类型会影响施加的轴向力的大小。利用这些知识，智能拆卸工厂RecyBot的拧松机器人被开发出来，并且实验证实了人类使用的策略的最优性。最后，提出了一个强大的松动算法设计方法作为研究结果的一般化。它可以严重加快螺丝拧松机器人和工具的发展。
