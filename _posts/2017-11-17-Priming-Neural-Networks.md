##### Abstract
Visual priming is known to affect the human visual system to allow detection of scene elements, even those that may have been near unnoticeable before, such as the presence of camouflaged animals. This process has been shown to be an effect of top-down signaling in the visual system triggered by the said cue. In this paper, we propose a mechanism to mimic the process of priming in the context of object detection and segmentation. We view priming as having a modulatory, cue dependent effect on layers of features within a network. Our results show how such a process can be complementary to, and at times more effective than simple post-processing applied to the output of the network, notably so in cases where the object is hard to detect such as in severe noise. Moreover, we find the effects of priming are sometimes stronger when early visual layers are affected. Overall, our experiments confirm that top-down signals can go a long way in improving object detection and segmentation.

已知视觉启动影响人类视觉系统以允许检测场景元素，甚至是那些在之前可能已经接近不可察觉的场景元素，例如伪装的动物的存在。已经显示该过程是由所述提示触发的视觉系统中自上而下的信令的效果。在本文中，我们提出了一种机制来模拟物体检测和分割环境下的启动过程。我们将启动视为对网络中的功能层具有调节，提示依赖效应。我们的研究结果表明，这样的过程如何能够与对网络输出进行简单的后处理相辅相成，有时甚至更有效，特别是在物体难以检测到的情况下，例如在严重的噪声中。而且，当早期视觉层受到影响时，我们发现启动效应有时更强。总的来说，我们的实验证实，自顶向下的信号可以在改进目标检测和分割方面发挥重要作用。
