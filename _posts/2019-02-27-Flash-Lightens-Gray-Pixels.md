##### Abstract
In the real world, a scene is usually cast by multiple illuminants and herein we address the problem of spatial illumination estimation. Our solution is based on detecting gray pixels with the help of flash photography. We show that flash photography significantly improves the performance of gray pixel detection without illuminant prior, training data or calibration of the flash. We also introduce a novel flash photography dataset generated from the MIT intrinsic dataset.
