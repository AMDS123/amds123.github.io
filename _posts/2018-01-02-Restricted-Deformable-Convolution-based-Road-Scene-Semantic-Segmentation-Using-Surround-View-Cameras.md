##### Abstract
Understanding the surrounding environment of the vehicle is still one of the challenges for autonomous driving. This paper addresses 360-degree road scene semantic segmentation using surround view cameras, which are widely equipped in existing production cars. First, in order to address large distortion problem in the fisheye images, Restricted Deformable Convolution (RDC) is proposed for semantic segmentation, which can effectively model geometric transformations by learning the shapes of convolutional filters conditioned on the input feature map. Second, in order to obtain a large-scale training set of surround view images, a novel method called zoom augmentation is proposed to transform conventional images to fisheye images. Finally, an RDC based semantic segmentation model is built. The model is trained for real-world surround view images through a multi-task learning architecture by combining real-world images with transformed images. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the RDC to handle images with large distortions, and the proposed approach shows a good performance using surround view cameras with the help of the transformed images.

了解车辆的周围环境仍然是自动驾驶的挑战之一。本文针对现有量产车中广泛配备的环视摄像机，进行了3​​60度道路场景语义分割。首先，为了解决鱼眼图像中的大失真问题，提出了一种语义分割的限制变形卷积（RDC），通过学习输入特征映射的卷积滤波器的形状，可以有效地对几何变换进行建模。其次，为了获得大规模的环视图像训练集，提出了一种新的缩放增强方法，将常规图像转化为鱼眼图像。最后，建立了基于RDC的语义分割模型。通过将真实世界的图像与转换的图像相结合，通过多任务学习体系结构对模型进行真实环境视图图像的训练。实验证明了RDC处理失真较大的图像的有效性，并且所提出的方法在变换图像的帮助下使用环视摄像机显示出良好的性能。
