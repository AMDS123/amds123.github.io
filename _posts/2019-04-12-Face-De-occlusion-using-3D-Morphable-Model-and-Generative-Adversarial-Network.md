##### Abstract
In recent decades, 3D morphable model (3DMM) has been commonly used in image-based photorealistic 3D face reconstruction. However, face images are often corrupted by serious occlusion by non-face objects including eyeglasses, masks, and hands. Such objects block the correct capture of landmarks and shading information. Therefore, the reconstructed 3D face model is hardly reusable. In this paper, a novel method is proposed to restore de-occluded face images based on inverse use of 3DMM and generative adversarial network. We utilize the 3DMM prior to the proposed adversarial network and combine a global and local adversarial convolutional neural network to learn face de-occlusion model. The 3DMM serves not only as geometric prior but also proposes the face region for the local discriminator. Experiment results confirm the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed algorithm in removing challenging types of occlusions with various head poses and illumination. Furthermore, the proposed method reconstructs the correct 3D face model with de-occluded textures.
