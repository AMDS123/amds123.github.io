##### Abstract
Sensitivity analysis in probabilistic discrete graphical models is usually conducted by varying one probability value at a time and observing how this affects output probabilities of interest. When one probability is varied then others are proportionally covaried to respect the sum-to-one condition of probability laws. The choice of proportional covariation is justified by a variety of optimality conditions, under which the original and the varied distributions are as close as possible under different measures of closeness. For variations of more than one parameter at a time proportional covariation is justified in some special cases only. In this work, for the large class of discrete statistical models entertaining a regular monomial parametrisation, we demonstrate the optimality of newly defined proportional multi-way schemes with respect to an optimality criterion based on the notion of I-divergence. We demonstrate that there are varying parameters choices for which proportional covariation is not optimal and identify the sub-family of model distributions where the distance between the original distribution and the one where probabilities are covaried proportionally is minimum. This is shown by adopting a new formal, geometric characterization of sensitivity analysis in monomial models, which include a wide array of probabilistic graphical models. We also demonstrate the optimality of proportional covariation for multi-way analyses in Naive Bayes classifiers.
