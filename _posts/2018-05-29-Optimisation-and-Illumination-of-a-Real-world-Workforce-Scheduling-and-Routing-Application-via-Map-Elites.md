##### Abstract
Workforce Scheduling and Routing Problems (WSRP) are very common in many practical domains, and usually, have a number of objectives. Illumination algorithms such as Map-Elites (ME) have recently gained traction in application to {\em design} problems, in providing multiple diverse solutions as well as illuminating the solution space in terms of user-defined characteristics, but typically require significant computational effort to produce the solution archive. We investigate whether ME can provide an effective approach to solving WSRP, a {\em repetitive} problem in which solutions have to be produced quickly and often. The goals of the paper are two-fold. The first is to evaluate whether ME can provide solutions of competitive quality to an Evolutionary Algorithm (EA) in terms of a single objective function, and the second to examine its ability to provide a repertoire of solutions that maximise user choice. We find that very small computational budgets favour the EA in terms of quality, but ME outperforms the EA at larger budgets, provides a more diverse array of solutions, and lends insight to the end-user.

劳动力调度和路由问题（WSRP）在许多实际领域中非常普遍，并且通常具有许多目标。诸如Map-Elites（ME）之类的照明算法最近在应用于设计问题，提供多种多样的解决方案以及根据用户定义的特征来照明解空间方面获得了牵引力，但是通常需要大量的计算工作量生成解决方案档案。我们调查ME是否可以提供解决WSRP的有效方法，这是一个{\ em重复}问题，其中解决方案必须快速且经常地生成。本文的目标是双重的。首先是评估ME是否能够以单一目标函数的方式向演化算法（EA）提供竞争品质的解决方案，其次是研究它提供解决方案的能力，以最大化用户选择。我们发现非常小的计算预算在质量方面更受青睐，但ME在更大的预算下胜过EA，提供更多元化的解决方案，并为最终用户提供洞察力。
