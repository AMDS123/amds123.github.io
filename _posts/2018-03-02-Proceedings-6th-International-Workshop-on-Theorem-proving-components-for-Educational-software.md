##### Abstract
The 6th International Workshop on Theorem proving components for Educational software (ThEdu'17) was held in Gothenburg, Sweden, on 6 Aug 2017. It was associated to the conference CADE26. Topics of interest include: methods of automated deduction applied to checking students' input; methods of automated deduction applied to prove post-conditions for particular problem solutions; combinations of deduction and computation enabling systems to propose next steps; automated provers specific for dynamic geometry systems; proof and proving in mathematics education. 
 ThEdu'17 was a vibrant workshop, with one invited talk and eight contributions. It triggered the post-proceedings at hand.
