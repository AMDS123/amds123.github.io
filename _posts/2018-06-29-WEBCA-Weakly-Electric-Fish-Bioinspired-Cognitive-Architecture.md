##### Abstract
Neuroethology has been an active field of study for more than a century now. Out of some of the most interesting species that has been studied so far, weakly electric fish is a fascinating one. It performs communication, echo-location and inter-species detection efficiently with an interesting configuration of sensors, neu-rons and a simple brain. In this paper we propose a cognitive architecture inspired by the way these fishes handle and process information. We believe that it is eas-ier to understand and mimic the neural architectures of a simpler species than that of human. Hence, the proposed architecture is expected to both help research in cognitive robotics and also help understand more complicated brains like that of human beings.

一个多世纪以来，神经伦理学一直是一个活跃的研究领域。在迄今为止研究的一些最有趣的物种中，弱电鱼是一个引人入胜的物种。它通过传感器，神经元和简单大脑的有趣配置高效地执行通信，回波定位和物种间检测。在这篇论文中，我们提出了一种由这些鱼类处理和处理信息的方式所启发的认知体系结构。我们相信，理解和模仿比人类更简单的物种的神经结构更容易。因此，所提出的架构预计既可以帮助研究认知机器人，也可以帮助理解像人类更复杂的大脑。
