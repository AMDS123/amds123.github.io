##### Abstract
A lot of research effort has been put into community detection from all corners of academic interest such as physics, mathematics and computer science. In this paper I have proposed a Bi-Objective Genetic Algorithm for community detection which maximizes modularity and community score. Then the results obtained for both benchmark and real life data sets are compared with other algorithms using the modularity and MNI performance metrics. The results show that the BOCD algorithm is capable of successfully detecting community structure in both real life and synthetic datasets, as well as improving upon the performance of previous techniques.

从物理学，数学和计算机科学等学术兴趣的各个角落开展了大量的研究工作。在本文中，我提出了一个双目标遗传算法用于社区检测，最大限度地提高了模块性和社区评分。然后，将基准和实际数据集的结果与使用模块性和MNI性能度量的其他算法进行比较。结果表明，BOCD算法能够成功地检测现实生活数据集和合成数据集中的社区结构，并对现有技术的性能进行改进。
