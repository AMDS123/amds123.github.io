##### Abstract
This article describes an approach to detect the wearing location of smart devices worn by pedestrians and cyclists. The detection, which is based solely on the sensors of the smart devices, is important context-information which can be used to parametrize subsequent algorithms, e.g. for dead reckoning or intention detection to improve the safety of vulnerable road users. The wearing location recognition can in terms of Organic Computing (OC) be seen as a step towards self-awareness and self-adaptation. For the wearing location detection a two-stage process is presented. It is subdivided into moving detection followed by the wearing location classification. Finally, the approach is evaluated on a real world dataset consisting of pedestrians and cyclists.

本文介绍了一种检测行人和骑自行车者佩戴的智能设备佩戴位置的方法。仅基于智能设备的传感器的检测是重要的上下文信息，其可以用于参数化随后的算法，例如，进行航位推算或意图检测，以提高弱势道路使用者的安全。佩戴位置识别可以将有机计算（OC）视为朝向自我意识和自我适应的一步。针对佩戴位置检测，提出了两阶段过程。它被细分为移动检测，然后是佩戴位置分类。最后，该方法在由行人和骑行者组成的真实世界数据集上进行评估。
