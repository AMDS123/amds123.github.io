##### Abstract
Visibility distance on the road pathway plays a significant role in road safety and in particular, has a clear impact on the choice of speed limits. Visibility distance is thus of importance for road engineers and authorities. While visibility distance criteria are routinely taken into account in road design, only a few systems exist for estimating it on existing road networks. Most existing systems comprise a target vehicle followed at a constant distance by an observer vehicle, which only allows to check if a given, fixed visibility distance is available. We propose two new approaches that allow estimating the maximum available visibility distance, involving only one vehicle and based on different sensor technologies, namely binocular stereovision and 3D range sensing (LIDAR). The first approach is based on the processing of two views taken by digital cameras onboard the diagnostic vehicle. The main stages of the process are: road segmentation, edge registration between the two views, road profile 3D reconstruction and finally, maximal road visibility distance estimation. The second approach involves the use of a Terrestrial LIDAR Mobile Mapping System. The triangulated 3D model of the road and its surroundings provided by the system is used to simulate targets at different distances, which allows estimating the maximum geometric visibility distance along the pathway. These approaches were developed in the context of the SARI-VIZIR PREDIT project. Both approaches are described, evaluated and compared. Their pros and cons with respect to vehicle following systems are also discussed.

道路上的可视距离在道路安全方面起着重要的作用，特别是对限速的选择有明显的影响。能见度距离对道路工程师和当局来说非常重要。虽然道路设计中经常考虑可见距离标准，但只有少数几个系统用于在现有道路网络上进行估算。大多数现有系统包括由观察者车辆以恒定距离跟随的目标车辆，其仅允许检查给定的固定可见距离是否可用。我们提出了两种新的方法，允许估计最大可用的可视距离，只涉及一个车辆，并基于不同的传感器技术，即双目立体视觉和3D距离感应（LIDAR）。第一种方法是基于对诊断车辆上的数码相机拍摄的两个视图的处理。该过程的主要阶段是：道路分割，两个视图之间的边缘配准，道路剖面三维重建以及最大道路可见距离估计。第二种方法涉及使用陆地激光雷达移动测绘系统。系统提供的道路及其周围的三维三维模型被用来模拟不同距离处的目标，这允许估计沿着路径的最大几何可见距离。这些方法是在SARI-VIZIR PREDIT项目的背景下开发的。这两种方法进行了描述，评估和比较。还讨论了它们在车辆跟随系统方面的优缺点。
