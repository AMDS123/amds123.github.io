##### Abstract
This paper presents a non-manual design engineering method based on heuristic search algorithm to search for candidate agents in the solution space which formed by artificial intelligence agents modeled on the base of bionics.Compared with the artificial design method represented by meta-learning and the bionics method represented by the neural architecture chip,this method is more feasible for realizing artificial general intelligence,and it has a much better interaction with cognitive neuroscience;at the same time,the engineering method is based on the theoretical hypothesis that the final learning algorithm is stable in certain scenarios,and has generalization ability in various scenarios.The paper discusses the theory preliminarily and proposes the possible correlation between the theory and the fixed-point theorem in the field of mathematics.Limited by the author's knowledge level,this correlation is proposed only as a kind of conjecture.

##### Abstract (translated by Google)
本文提出了一种基于启发式搜索算法的非手动设计工程方法，用于在仿生学的基础上，以人工智能代理为基础，在解空间中搜索候选代理。与元学习所代表的人工设计方法相比较。以神经结构芯片为代表的仿生学方法，该方法对于实现人工智能更为可行，与认知神经科学有更好的相互作用;同时，工程方法基于最终学习算法的理论假设。本文对这一理论进行了初步探讨，并提出了理论与数学领域定理定理之间可能存在的相关性。在作者的知识水平的作用下，这种相关性得到了证实。提出只作为一种猜想。
