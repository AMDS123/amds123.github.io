##### Abstract
In the last few years, Deep Learning (DL) has been showing superior performance in different modalities of biomedical image analysis. Several DL architectures have been proposed for classification, segmentation, and detection tasks in medical imaging and computational pathology. In this paper, we propose a new DL architecture, the NABLA-N network, with better feature fusion techniques in decoding units for dermoscopic image segmentation tasks. The NABLA-N network has several advances for segmentation tasks. First, this model ensures better feature representation for semantic segmentation with a combination of low to high-level feature maps. Second, this network shows better quantitative and qualitative results with the same or fewer network parameters compared to other methods. In addition, the Inception Recurrent Residual Convolutional Neural Network (IRRCNN) model is used for skin cancer classification. The proposed NABLA-N network and IRRCNN models are evaluated for skin cancer segmentation and classification on the benchmark datasets from the International Skin Imaging Collaboration 2018 (ISIC-2018). The experimental results show superior performance on segmentation tasks compared to the Recurrent Residual U-Net (R2U-Net). The classification model shows around 87% testing accuracy for dermoscopic skin cancer classification on ISIC2018 dataset.
