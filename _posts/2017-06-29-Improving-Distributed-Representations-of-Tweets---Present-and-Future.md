##### Abstract
Unsupervised representation learning for tweets is an important research field which helps in solving several business applications such as sentiment analysis, hashtag prediction, paraphrase detection and microblog ranking. A good tweet representation learning model must handle the idiosyncratic nature of tweets which poses several challenges such as short length, informal words, unusual grammar and misspellings. However, there is a lack of prior work which surveys the representation learning models with a focus on tweets. In this work, we organize the models based on its objective function which aids the understanding of the literature. We also provide interesting future directions, which we believe are fruitful in advancing this field by building high-quality tweet representation learning models.

微博无监督表示学习是一个重要的研究领域，有助于解决情感分析，标签预测，释义检测和微博排名等多种商业应用。一个好的推特表示学习模型必须处理推特的特质性质，这会带来一些挑战，如短小，非正式的词汇，不寻常的语法和拼写错误。然而，缺乏以推特为重点的代表学习模式的调查。在这项工作中，我们根据其目标函数来组织模型，这有助于理解文献。我们也提供有趣的未来方向，我们相信通过构建高质量的推特表示学习模型在推进这一领域取得丰硕成果。
