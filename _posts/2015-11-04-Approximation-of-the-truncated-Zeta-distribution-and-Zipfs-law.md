##### Abstract
Zipf's law appears in many application areas but does not have a closed form expression, which may make its use cumbersome. Since it coincides with the truncated version of the Zeta distribution, in this paper we propose three approximate closed form expressions for the truncated Zeta distribution, which may be employed for Zipf's law as well. The three approximations are based on the replacement of the sum occurring in Zipf's law with an integral, and are named respectively the integral approximation, the average integral approximation, and the trapezoidal approximation. While the first one is shown to be of little use, the trapezoidal approximation exhibits an error which is typically lower than 1\%, but is as low as 0.1\% for the range of values of the Zipf parameter below 1.

Zipf定律出现在许多应用领域，但没有封闭的表达式，这可能会使其使用起来很麻烦。由于它与Zeta分布的截断版本相吻合，本文中我们提出了三个近似的截尾Zeta分布的闭式表达式，它也可以用于Zipf定律。这三个近似是基于Zipf定律中出现的和的置换，分别称为积分近似，平均积分近似和梯形近似。尽管第一个示例没有多大用处，但是梯形近似表现出通常低于1 /％的误差，但是对于Zipf参数的值低于1的范围，其误差低至0.1％。
