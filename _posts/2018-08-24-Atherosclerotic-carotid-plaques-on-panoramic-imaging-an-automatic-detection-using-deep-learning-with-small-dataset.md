##### Abstract
Stroke is the second most frequent cause of death worldwide with a considerable economic burden on the health systems. In about 15% of strokes, atherosclerotic carotid plaques (ACPs) constitute the main etiological factor. Early detection of ACPs may have a key-role for preventing strokes by managing the patient a-priory to the occurrence of the damage. ACPs can be detected on panoramic images. As these are one of the most common images performed for routine dental practice, they can be used as a source of available data for computerized methods of automatic detection in order to significantly increase timely diagnosis of ACPs. Recently, there has been a definite breakthrough in the field of analysis of medical images due to the use of deep learning based on neural networks. These methods, however have been barely used in dentistry. In this study we used the Faster Region-based Convolutional Network (Faster R-CNN) for deep learning. We aimed to assess the operation of the algorithm on a small database of 65 panoramic images. Due to a small amount of available training data, we had to use data augmentation by changing the brightness and randomly flipping and rotating cropped regions of interest in multiple angles. Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) analysis was performed to calculate the accuracy of detection. ACP was detected with a sensitivity of 75%, specificity of 80% and an accuracy of 83%. The ROC analysis showed a significant Area Under Curve (AUC) difference from 0.5. Our novelty lies in that we have showed the efficiency of the Faster R-CNN algorithm in detecting ACPs on routine panoramic images based on a small database. There is a need to further improve the application of the algorithm to the level of introducing this methodology in routine dental practice in order to enable us to prevent stroke events.

中风是全球第二大常见死亡原因，对卫生系统造成相当大的经济负担。在大约15％的中风中，动脉粥样硬化颈动脉斑块（ACP）构成了主要的病因。 ACP的早期检测可能通过管理患者对损伤发生的预防来起到预防中风的关键作用。可以在全景图像上检测ACP。由于这些是常规牙科实践中最常见的图像之一，因此它们可用作计算机化自动检测方法的可用数据来源，以显着增加ACP的及时诊断。最近，由于使用基于神经网络的深度学习，在医学图像分析领域已经取得了一定的突破。然而，这些方法几乎没有用于牙科。在这项研究中，我们使用基于区域的快速卷积网络（更快的R-CNN）进行深度学习。我们的目的是评估算法在65个全景图像的小型数据库上的运行。由于少量可用的训练数据，我们不得不通过改变亮度和随机翻转并以多个角度旋转裁剪的感兴趣区域来使用数据增强。进行接收器操作特性（ROC）分析以计算检测的准确性。检测到ACP的灵敏度为75％，特异性为80％，准确度为83％。 ROC分析显示显着的面积下曲线（AUC）与0.5的差异。我们的新颖之处在于我们已经展示了更快的R-CNN算法在基于小型数据库的常规全景图像上检测ACP的效率。需要进一步改进算法的应用到在常规牙科实践中引入该方法的水平，以便使我们能够预防中风事件。
