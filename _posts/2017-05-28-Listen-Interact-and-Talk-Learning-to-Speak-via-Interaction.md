##### Abstract
One of the long-term goals of artificial intelligence is to build an agent that can communicate intelligently with human in natural language. Most existing work on natural language learning relies heavily on training over a pre-collected dataset with annotated labels, leading to an agent that essentially captures the statistics of the fixed external training data. As the training data is essentially a static snapshot representation of the knowledge from the annotator, the agent trained this way is limited in adaptiveness and generalization of its behavior. Moreover, this is very different from the language learning process of humans, where language is acquired during communication by taking speaking action and learning from the consequences of speaking action in an interactive manner. This paper presents an interactive setting for grounded natural language learning, where an agent learns natural language by interacting with a teacher and learning from feedback, thus learning and improving language skills while taking part in the conversation. To achieve this goal, we propose a model which incorporates both imitation and reinforcement by leveraging jointly sentence and reward feedbacks from the teacher. Experiments are conducted to validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

##### Abstract (translated by Google)
人工智能的长期目标之一是建立一个能够以自然语言与人进行智能交流的智能体。大多数现有的自然语言学习工作在很大程度上依赖于对带有注释标签的预先收集的数据集进行训练，从而导致代理人从本质上捕获固定外部训练数据的统计数据。由于训练数据实质上是来自注释器的知识的静态快照表示，因此以这种方式训练的代理在其行为的适应性和概括性方面受到限制。而且，这与人类的语言学习过程是非常不同的，在交流过程中，语言是通过采取口头行动并以交互方式从口头行动的后果中学习而获得的。本文提出了一个基于自然语言学习的交互式设置，其中一个智能体通过与老师交互并从反馈中学习来学习自然语言，从而在参与对话的同时学习和提高语言技能。为了实现这个目标，我们提出了一个模型，通过利用老师的联合判决和奖励反馈来结合模仿和加强。进行实验来验证所提出的方法的有效性。
