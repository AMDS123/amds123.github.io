##### Abstract
Training deep feature hierarchies to solve supervised learning tasks has achieved state of the art performance on many problems in computer vision. However, a principled way in which to train such hierarchies in the unsupervised setting has remained elusive. In this work we suggest a new architecture and loss for training deep feature hierarchies that linearize the transformations observed in unlabeled natural video sequences. This is done by training a generative model to predict video frames. We also address the problem of inherent uncertainty in prediction by introducing latent variables that are non-deterministic functions of the input into the network architecture.

训练深入的特征层次结构来解决监督学习任务已经在计算机视觉中的许多问题上取得了最先进的性能。然而，在无监督环境中训练这种等级制度的原则性方法仍然是难以捉摸的。在这项工作中，我们建议新的架构和损失训练深层特征层次结构，线性化在未标记的自然视频序列中观察到的转换。这是通过训练生成模型来预测视频帧来完成的。我们还通过引入潜在变量来解决预测中固有的不确定性问题，这些潜在变量是网络结构输入的非确定性函数。
