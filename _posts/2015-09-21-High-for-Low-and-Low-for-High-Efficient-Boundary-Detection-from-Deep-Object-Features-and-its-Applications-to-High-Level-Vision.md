##### Abstract
Most of the current boundary detection systems rely exclusively on low-level features, such as color and texture. However, perception studies suggest that humans employ object-level reasoning when judging if a particular pixel is a boundary. Inspired by this observation, in this work we show how to predict boundaries by exploiting object-level features from a pretrained object-classification network. Our method can be viewed as a "High-for-Low" approach where high-level object features inform the low-level boundary detection process. Our model achieves state-of-the-art performance on an established boundary detection benchmark and it is efficient to run. Additionally, we show that due to the semantic nature of our boundaries we can use them to aid a number of high-level vision tasks. We demonstrate that using our boundaries we improve the performance of state-of-the-art methods on the problems of semantic boundary labeling, semantic segmentation and object proposal generation. We can view this process as a "Low-for-High" scheme, where low-level boundaries aid high-level vision tasks. Thus, our contributions include a boundary detection system that is accurate, efficient, generalizes well to multiple datasets, and is also shown to improve existing state-of-the-art high-level vision methods on three distinct tasks.

目前大多数的边界检测系统仅仅依赖于低级特征，比如颜色和纹理。然而，感知研究表明，当判断特定像素是否是边界时，人类使用对象级推理。受这一观察的启发，在这项工作中，我们展示了如何通过利用预训练对象分类网络中的对象级特征来预测边界。我们的方法可以被看作是高级对象特征通知低级边界检测过程的“高到低”的方法。我们的模型通过建立的边界检测基准实现了最先进的性能，运行效率高。此外，我们还表明，由于我们的边界的语义性质，我们可以使用它们来帮助一些高层次的视觉任务。我们证明，使用我们的边界，我们提高了语义边界标记，语义分割和对象建议生成问题的最先进方法的性能。我们可以把这个过程视为一个“低到高”的方案，低层次的边界有助于高层次的视觉任务。因此，我们的贡献包括精确，高效的边界检测系统，能够很好地适用于多个数据集，并且还显示出可以改善现有的最先进的高级视觉方法，以完成三个不同的任务。
