##### Abstract
The wavelet frame systems have been playing an active role in image restoration and many other image processing fields over the past decades, owing to the good capability of sparsely approximating piece-wise smooth functions such as images. In this paper, we propose a novel wavelet frame based sparse recovery model called \textit{Support Driven Sparse Regularization} (SDSR) for image deblurring, where the partial support information of frame coefficients is attained via a self-learning strategy and exploited via the proposed truncated $\ell_0$ regularization. Moreover, the state-of-the-art image restoration methods can be naturally incorporated into our proposed wavelet frame based sparse recovery framework. In particular, in order to achieve reliable support estimation of the frame coefficients, we make use of the state-of-the-art image restoration result such as that from the IDD-BM3D method as the initial reference image for support estimation. Our extensive experimental results have shown convincing improvements over existing state-of-the-art deblurring methods.

小波框架系统在图像复原等多种图像处理领域具有较强的稀疏逼近分段平滑函数（如图像）的能力。在本文中，我们提出了一种新的基于小波框架的稀疏恢复模型，称为\ textit {支持驱动稀疏正则化}（SDSR）用于图像去模糊，其中帧系数的部分支持信息通过自学习策略获得，并通过建议截断$ \ ell_0 $正则化。此外，最先进的图像恢复方法可以自然地纳入我们提出的基于小波框架的稀疏恢复框架。具体而言，为了实现对帧系数的可靠支持估计，我们利用诸如来自IDD-BM3D方法的最新图像恢复结果作为支持度估计的初始参考图像。我们广泛的实验结果表明，与现有的最先进的去模糊方法相比有令人信服的改进。
