##### Abstract
Incorporating additional knowledge in the learning process can be beneficial for several computer vision and machine learning tasks. Whether privileged information originates from a source domain that is adapted to a target domain, or as additional features available at training time only, using such privileged (i.e., auxiliary) information is of high importance as it improves the recognition performance and generalization. However, both primary and privileged information are rarely derived from the same distribution, which poses an additional challenge to the recognition task. To address these challenges, we present a novel learning paradigm that leverages privileged information in a domain adaptation setup to perform visual recognition tasks. The proposed framework, named Adaptive SVM+, combines the advantages of both the learning using privileged information (LUPI) paradigm and the domain adaptation framework, which are naturally embedded in the objective function of a regular SVM. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on the publicly available Animals with Attributes and INTERACT datasets and report state-of-the-art results in both of them.

在学习过程中结合额外的知识对于几个计算机视觉和机器学习任务是有益的。无论特权信息源自适应于目标域的源域，还是作为仅在训练时间可用的附加特征，使用这样的特权（即，辅助）信息是非常重要的，因为它提高了识别性能和泛化。然而，主要和特权信息很少从同一分布派生，这对识别任务提出了额外的挑战。为了应对这些挑战，我们提出了一种新颖的学习范式，利用域适配设置中的特权信息来执行视觉识别任务。所提出的框架称为自适应SVM +，结合了利用特权信息学习（LUPI）范式的学习和域自适应框架的优点，这些框架自然地被嵌入在规则SVM的目标函数中。我们展示了我们的方法在有属性和INTERACT数据集的公开可用的动物上的有效性，并报告了它们两者中最先进的结果。
