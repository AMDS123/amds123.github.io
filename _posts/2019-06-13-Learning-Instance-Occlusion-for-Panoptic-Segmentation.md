##### Abstract
Recently, the vision community has shown renewed interest in the effort of panoptic segmentation --- previously known as image parsing. While a large amount of progress has been made within both the instance and semantic segmentation tasks separately, panoptic segmentation implies knowledge of both (countable) "things" and semantic "stuff" within a single output. A common approach involves the fusion of respective instance and semantic segmentations proposals, however, this method has not explicitly addressed the jump from instance segmentation to non-overlapping placement within a single output and often fails to layout overlapping instances adequately. We propose a straightforward extension to the Mask R-CNN framework that is tasked with resolving how two instance masks should overlap one another in the fused output as a binary relation. We show competitive increases in overall panoptic quality (PQ) and particular gains in the "things" portion of the standard panoptic segmentation benchmark, reaching state-of-the-art against methods with comparable architectures.
