##### Abstract
The considered problem is how to optimally allocate a set of jobs to technicians of different skills such that the number of technicians of each skill does not exceed the number of persons with that skill designation. The key motivation is the quick sensitivity analysis in terms of the workforce size which is quite necessary in many industries in the presence of unexpected work orders. A time-indexed mathematical model is proposed to minimize the total weighted completion time of the jobs. The proposed model is decomposed into a number of single-skill sub-problems so that each one is a combination of a series of nested binary Knapsack problems. A heuristic procedure is proposed to solve the problem. Our experimental results, based on a real-world case study, reveal that the proposed method quickly produces a schedule statistically close to the optimal one while the classical optimal procedure is very time-consuming.

所考虑的问题是如何为不同技能的技术人员优化分配一组工作，以便每种技能的技术人员数量不超过具有该技能指定人员的人数。关键动机是对劳动力规模进行快速敏感性分析，这在许多行业出现意外工单时非常必要。提出了一个时间索引的数学模型来最小化作业的总加权完成时间。所提出的模型被分解成许多单技能子问题，因此每个问题都是一系列嵌套二元背包问题的组合。提出了启发式程序来解决这个问题。我们基于实际案例研究的实验结果表明，所提出的方法能够快速生成统计上接近最优方案的时间表，而传统的最优过程非常耗时。
