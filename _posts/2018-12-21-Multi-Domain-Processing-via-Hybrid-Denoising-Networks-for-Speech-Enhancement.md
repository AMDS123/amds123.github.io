##### Abstract
We present a hybrid framework that leverages the trade-off between temporal and frequency precision in audio representations to improve the performance of speech enhancement task. We first show that conventional approaches using specific representations such as raw-audio and spectrograms are each effective at targeting different types of noise. By integrating both approaches, our model can learn multi-scale and multi-domain features, effectively removing noise existing on different regions on the time-frequency space in a complementary way. Experimental results show that the proposed hybrid model yields better performance and robustness than using each model individually.
