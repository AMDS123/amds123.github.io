##### Abstract
Safety is a critical aspect in all swimming pools. This paper describes a near-drowning early prediction technique using novel equations (NEPTUNE). NEPTUNE uses equations or rules that would be able to detect neardrowning using at least 1 but not more than 5 seconds of video sequence with no false positives. The backbone of NEPTUNE encompasses a mix of statistical image processing to merge images for a video sequence followed by Kmeans clustering to extract segments in the merged image and finally a revisit to statistical image processing to derive variables for every segment. These variables would be used by the equations to identify near-drowning. NEPTUNE has the potential to be integrated into a swimming pool camera system that would send an alarm to the lifeguards for early response so that the likelihood of recovery is high.

安全是所有游泳池的关键因素。本文描述了一种使用小说方程（NEPTUNE）的近乎淹没早期预测技术。 NEPTUNE使用方程或规则，能够使用至少1但不超过5秒的视频序列检测近视，而不会出现误报。 NEPTUNE的骨干包括统计图像处理的混合，以合并视频序列的图像，接着进行Kmeans聚类以提取合并图像中的片段，并最终重新审视统计图像处理以导出每个片段的变量。这些变量将被方程用来识别近溺水。 NEPTUNE有潜力整合到一个游泳池照相系统中，该系统可以向救生员发出警报，以便及早作出反应，以便恢复的可能性很高。
