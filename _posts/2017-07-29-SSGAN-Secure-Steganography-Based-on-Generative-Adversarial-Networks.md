##### Abstract
In this paper, a novel strategy of Secure Steganograpy based on Generative Adversarial Networks is proposed to generate suitable and secure covers for steganography. The proposed architecture has one generative network, and two discriminative networks. The generative network mainly evaluates the visual quality of the generated images for steganography, and the discriminative networks are utilized to assess their suitableness for information hiding. Different from the existing work which adopts Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Networks, we utilize another form of generative adversarial networks. By using this new form of generative adversarial networks, significant improvements are made on the convergence speed, the training stability and the image quality. Furthermore, a sophisticated steganalysis network is reconstructed for the discriminative network, and the network can better evaluate the performance of the generated images. Numerous experiments are conducted on the publicly available datasets to demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed method.

本文提出了一种基于生成对抗网络的安全隐写的新策略，为隐写提供了合适的安全掩码。所提出的架构有一个生成网络和两个判别网络。生成网络主要评估生成的图像的隐写的视觉质量，利用判别网络评估它们对信息隐藏的适用性。与现有的采用Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Networks的工作不同，我们利用另一种形式的生成对抗网络。通过使用这种新型的生成对抗网络，收敛速度，训练稳定性和图像质量都有了显着的提高。此外，针对判别性网络重构了一个复杂的隐写分析网络，网络可以更好地评估生成的图像的性能。在公开可用的数据集上进行了大量的实验，以证明所提出的方法的有效性和鲁棒性。
