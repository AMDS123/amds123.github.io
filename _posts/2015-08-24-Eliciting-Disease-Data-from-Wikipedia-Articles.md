##### Abstract
Traditional disease surveillance systems suffer from several disadvantages, including reporting lags and antiquated technology, that have caused a movement towards internet-based disease surveillance systems. Internet systems are particularly attractive for disease outbreaks because they can provide data in near real-time and can be verified by individuals around the globe. However, most existing systems have focused on disease monitoring and do not provide a data repository for policy makers or researchers. In order to fill this gap, we analyzed Wikipedia article content. We demonstrate how a named-entity recognizer can be trained to tag case counts, death counts, and hospitalization counts in the article narrative that achieves an F1 score of 0.753. We also show, using the 2014 West African Ebola virus disease epidemic article as a case study, that there are detailed time series data that are consistently updated that closely align with ground truth data. We argue that Wikipedia can be used to create the first community-driven open-source emerging disease detection, monitoring, and repository system.

传统的疾病监测系统存在着报告滞后和技术陈旧等缺点，导致了基于互联网的疾病监测系统的发展。互联网系统对疾病爆发特别有吸引力，因为它们可以近乎实时地提供数据，并且可以由全球的个人验证。但是，大多数现有的系统都集中在疾病监测上，而没有为政策制定者或研究人员提供数据库。为了填补这个空白，我们分析了维基百科的文章内容。我们演示如何可以训练一个命名实体识别器来标记病例数，死亡数和住院数在文章叙述中达到0.753的F1分数。我们还使用2014年西非埃博拉病毒病流行病学文章作为案例研究，显示有详细的时间序列数据与地面实况数据保持一致的更新。我们认为，维基百科可以用来创建第一个社区驱动的开源新兴疾病检测，监测和信息库系统。
