##### Abstract
Voice cloning is a highly desired feature for personalized speech interfaces. Neural network based speech synthesis has been shown to generate high quality speech for a large number of speakers. In this paper, we introduce a neural voice cloning system that takes a few audio samples as input. We study two approaches: speaker adaptation and speaker encoding. Speaker adaptation is based on fine-tuning a multi-speaker generative model with a few cloning samples. Speaker encoding is based on training a separate model to directly infer a new speaker embedding from cloning audios and to be used with a multi-speaker generative model. In terms of naturalness of the speech and its similarity to original speaker, both approaches can achieve good performance, even with very few cloning audios. While speaker adaptation can achieve better naturalness and similarity, the cloning time or required memory for the speaker encoding approach is significantly less, making it favorable for low-resource deployment.

语音克隆是个性化语音界面非常理想的功能。已经显示基于神经网络的语音合成为大量讲话者生成高质量语音。在本文中，我们介绍一个神经语音克隆系统，它将一些音频样本作为输入。我们研究两种方法：说话人适应和说话人编码。说话者适应是基于用少数克隆样本微调多说话者生成模型。说话人编码基于训练单独的模型来直接从克隆音频中推断出新的说话者嵌入，并与多说话者生成模型一起使用。就语音的自然性及其与原始说话人的相似性而言，即使克隆音频非常少，两种方法都可以实现良好的性能。虽然说话人适应可以获得更好的自然性和相似性，但说话人编码方法的克隆时间或所需存储空间明显较少，这有利于低资源部署。
