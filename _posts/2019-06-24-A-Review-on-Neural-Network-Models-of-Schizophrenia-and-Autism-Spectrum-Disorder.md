##### Abstract
This survey presents the most relevant neural network models of autism spectrum disorder and schizophrenia, from the first connectionist models to recent deep network architectures. We analyzed and compared the most representative symptoms with its neural model counterpart, detailing the alteration introduced in the network that generates each of the symptoms, and identifying their strengths and weaknesses. For completeness we additionally cross-compared Bayesian and free-energy approaches. Models of schizophrenia mainly focused on hallucinations and delusional thoughts using neural disconnections or inhibitory imbalance as the predominating alteration. Models of autism rather focused on perceptual difficulties, mainly excessive attention to environment details, implemented as excessive inhibitory connections or increased sensory precision. We found an excessive tight view of the psychopathologies around one specific and simplified effect, usually constrained to the technical idiosyncrasy of the network used. Recent theories and evidence on sensorimotor integration and body perception combined with modern neural network architectures offer a broader and novel spectrum to approach these psychopathologies, outlining the future research on neural networks computational psychiatry, a powerful asset for understanding the inner processes of the human brain.
