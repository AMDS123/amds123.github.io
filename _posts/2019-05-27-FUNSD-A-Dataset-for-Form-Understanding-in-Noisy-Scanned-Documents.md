##### Abstract
In this paper, we present a new dataset for Form Understanding in Noisy Scanned Documents (FUNSD). Form Understanding (FoUn) aims at extracting and structuring the textual content of forms. The dataset comprises 200 fully annotated real scanned forms. The documents are noisy and exhibit large variabilities in their representation making FoUn a challenging task. The proposed dataset can be used for various tasks including text detection, optical character recognition (OCR), spatial layout analysis and entity labeling/linking. To the best of our knowledge this is the first publicly available dataset with comprehensive annotations addressing the FoUn task. We also present a set of baselines and introduce metrics to evaluate performance on the FUNSD dataset. The FUNSD dataset can be downloaded at https://guillaumejaume.github. io/FUNSD/.
