##### Abstract
High spin states of cation vacancies in GaP, GaN, AlN, BN, ZnO and BeO were analyzed by first principles calculations. The spin-polarized vacancy-induced level is located in the band gap in GaP, ZnO and BeO. In the nitrides, the stronger exchange coupling forces the vacancy states to be resonant with valence bands, forbids formation of positively charged vacancies in GaN and BN, and allows Al vacancy in p-AlN to assume the highest possible S=2 spin state. The shape of the spin density, isotropic in the zinc blende structure, has a pronounced directional character in the wurtzite structure. Stability of spin polarization of the vacancy states is determined by spin polarization energies of anions, as well as by interatomic distances between the vacancy neighbors, and thus is given by both the lattice constant of the host and the atomic relaxations around the vacancy. Implications for experiment are discussed.

##### Abstract (translated by Google)
通过第一性原理计算分析了GaP，GaN，AlN，BN，ZnO和BeO中阳离子空位的高自旋态。自旋极化的空位诱导能级位于GaP，ZnO和BeO的带隙中。在氮化物中，更强的交换耦合迫使空位态与价带共振，禁止在GaN和BN中形成带正电的空位，并允许p-AlN中的Al空位呈现最高可能的S = 2自旋态。闪锌矿结构中的自旋密度形状各向同性，在纤锌矿结构中具有明显的方向性。空位状态的自旋极化的稳定性由阴离子的​​自旋极化能以及空位相邻位之间的原子间距确定，因此由主体的晶格常数和空位周围的原子弛豫给出。讨论实验的意义。
