##### Abstract
This paper presents an application of specification based runtime verification techniques to control mobile robots in a reactive manner. In our case study, we develop a layered control architecture where runtime monitors constructed from formal specifications are embedded into the navigation stack. We use temporal logic and regular expressions to describe safety requirements and mission specifications, respectively. An immediate benefit of our approach is that it leverages simple requirements and objectives of traditional control applications to more complex specifications in a non-intrusive and compositional way. Finally, we demonstrate a simulation of robots controlled by the proposed architecture and we discuss further extensions of our approach.
