##### Abstract
Sarcasm is considered one of the most difficult problem in sentiment analysis. In our ob-servation on Indonesian social media, for cer-tain topics, people tend to criticize something using sarcasm. Here, we proposed two additional features to detect sarcasm after a common sentiment analysis is conducted. The features are the negativity information and the number of interjection words. We also employed translated SentiWordNet in the sentiment classification. All the classifications were conducted with machine learning algorithms. The experimental results showed that the additional features are quite effective in the sarcasm detection.

讽刺被认为是情绪分析中最困难的问题之一。在对印度尼西亚社交媒体的观察中，对于某些话题，人们倾向于用讽刺来批评某些东西。在这里，我们提出了两个额外的功能来检测讽刺后，进行共同的情感分析。特征是否定性信息和感叹词的数量。我们还使用翻译的SentiWordNet进行情感分类。所有分类均使用机器学习算法进行。实验结果表明，附加功能在讽刺检测中非常有效。
