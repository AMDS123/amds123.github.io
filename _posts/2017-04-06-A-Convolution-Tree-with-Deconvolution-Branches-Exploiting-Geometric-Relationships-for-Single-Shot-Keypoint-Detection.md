##### Abstract
Recently, Deep Convolution Networks (DCNNs) have been applied to the task of face alignment and have shown potential for learning improved feature representations. Although deeper layers can capture abstract concepts like pose, it is difficult to capture the geometric relationships among the keypoints in DCNNs. In this paper, we propose a novel convolution-deconvolution network for facial keypoint detection. Our model predicts the 2D locations of the keypoints and their individual visibility along with 3D head pose, while exploiting the spatial relationships among different keypoints. Different from existing approaches of modeling these relationships, we propose learnable transform functions which captures the relationships between keypoints at feature level. However, due to extensive variations in pose, not all of these relationships act at once, and hence we propose, a pose-based routing function which implicitly models the active relationships. Both transform functions and the routing function are implemented through convolutions in a multi-task framework. Our approach presents a single-shot keypoint detection method, making it different from many existing cascade regression-based methods. We also show that learning these relationships significantly improve the accuracy of keypoint detections for in-the-wild face images from challenging datasets such as AFW and AFLW.

最近，深度卷积网络（DCNN）已被应用于面对齐的任务，并显示出学习改进的特征表示的潜力。尽管更深的图层可以捕捉像姿势这样的抽象概念，但很难捕捉到DCNN中的关键点之间的几何关系。在本文中，我们提出了一种新的面部关键点检测的卷积 - 反卷积网络。我们的模型预测关键点的二维位置以及它们的个人可见性以及三维头部姿势，同时利用不同关键点之间的空间关系。与现有的对这些关系进行建模的方法不同，我们提出了可学习的变换函数来捕捉特征级关键点之间的关系。然而，由于姿态的广泛变化，并非所有这些关系都立即行动，因此我们提出了一种基于姿态的路由功能，隐式地建模活动关系。转换函数和路由功能都是通过多任务框架中的卷积来实现的。我们的方法提出了一种单点关键点检测方法，使其不同于现有的基于级联回归的方法。我们还表明，学习这些关系可显着提高AFW和AFLW等具有挑战性的数据集中的野外人脸图像的关键点检测的准确性。
