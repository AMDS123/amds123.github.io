##### Abstract
This article considers two variants of a shortest path problem for a car-like robot visiting a set of waypoints. The sequence of waypoints to be visited is specified in the first variant while the robot is allowed to visit the waypoints in any sequence in the second variant. Field of view constraints are also placed when the robot arrives at a waypoint, i.e., the orientation of the robot at any waypoint is restricted to belong to a given interval of angles at the waypoint. The shortest path problem is first solved for two waypoints with the field of view constraints using Pontryagin's minimum principle. Using the results for the two point problem, tight lower and upper bounds on the length of the shortest path are developed for visiting n points by relaxing the requirement that the arrival angle must be equal to the departure angle of the robot at each waypoint. Theoretical bounds are also provided on the length of the feasible solutions obtained by the proposed algorithm. Simulation results verify the performance of the bounds for instances with 20 waypoints.

本文考虑了一种类似汽车的机器人访问一组航路点的最短路径问题的两种变体。要访问的航路点序列在第一变型中指定，而允许机器人在第二变型中以任何顺序访问航路点。当机器人到达航路点时也放置视野约束，即，机器人在任何航路点的方向被限制为属于航路点处的给定角度间隔。使用Pontryagin的最小原理，首先使用视场约束来解决两个航路点的最短路径问题。利用两点问题的结果，通过放宽到达角度必须等于机器人在每个航路点的离开角度的要求，开发了用于访问n个点的最短路径长度的紧密下限和上限。还提供了由所提出的算法获得的可行解的长度的理论界限。仿真结果验证了具有20个航点的实例边界的性能。
