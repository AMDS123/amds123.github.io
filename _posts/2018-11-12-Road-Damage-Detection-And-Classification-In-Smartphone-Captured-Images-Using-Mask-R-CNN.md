##### Abstract
This paper summarizes the design, experiments and results of our solution to the Road Damage Detection and Classification Challenge held as part of the 2018 IEEE International Conference On Big Data Cup. Automatic detection and classification of damage in roads is an essential problem for multiple applications like maintenance and autonomous driving. We demonstrate that convolutional neural net based instance detection and classfication approaches can be used to solve this problem. In particular we show that Mask-RCNN, one of the state-of-the-art algorithms for object detection, localization and instance segmentation of natural images, can be used to perform this task in a fast manner with effective results. We achieve a mean F1 score of 0.528 at an IoU of 50% on the task of detection and classification of different types of damages in real-world road images acquired using a smartphone camera and our average inference time for each image is 0.105 seconds on an NVIDIA GeForce 1080Ti graphic card. The code and saved models for our approach can be found here : https://github.com/sshkhr/BigDataCup18 Submission
