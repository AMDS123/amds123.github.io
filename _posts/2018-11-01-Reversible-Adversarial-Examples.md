##### Abstract
Deep Neural Networks have recently led to significant improvement in many fields such as image classification and speech recognition. However, these machine learning models are vulnerable to adversarial examples which can mislead machine learning classifiers to give incorrect classifications. In this paper, we take advantage of reversible data hiding to construct reversible adversarial examples which are still misclassified by Deep Neural Networks. Furthermore, the proposed method can recover original images from reversible adversarial examples with no distortion.
