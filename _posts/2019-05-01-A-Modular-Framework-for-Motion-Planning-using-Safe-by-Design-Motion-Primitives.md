##### Abstract
We present a modular framework for solving a motion planning problem among a group of robots. The proposed framework utilizes a finite set of low level motion primitives to generate motions in a gridded workspace. The constraints on allowable sequences of motion primitives are formalized through a maneuver automaton. At the high level, a control policy determines which motion primitive is executed in each box of the gridded workspace. We state general conditions on motion primitives to obtain provably correct behavior so that a library of safe-by-design motion primitives can be designed. The overall framework yields a highly robust design by utilizing feedback strategies at both the low and high levels. We provide specific designs for motion primitives and control policies suitable for multi-robot motion planning; the modularity of our approach enables one to independently customize the designs of each of these components. Our approach is experimentally validated on a group of quadrocopters.
