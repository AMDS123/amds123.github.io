##### Abstract
We present the first strong detection of very high energy gamma-rays from the close (z=0.048) X-ray selected BL Lacertae object 1ES1959+650. Observations were made with the Whipple 10m telescope on Mt. Hopkins, Arizona, using the atmospheric Cherenkov imaging technique. The flux between May and July 2002 was highly variable, with a mean of 0.64 +/- 0.03 times the steady flux from the Crab Nebula and reaching a maximum of five Crab, with variability on timescales as short as seven hours.
