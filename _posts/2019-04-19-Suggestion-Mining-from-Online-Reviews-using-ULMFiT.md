##### Abstract
In this paper we present our approach and the system description for Sub Task A of SemEval 2019 Task 9: Suggestion Mining from Online Reviews and Forums. Given a sentence, the task asks to predict whether the sentence consists of a suggestion or not. Our model is based on Universal Language Model Fine-tuning for Text Classification. We apply various pre-processing techniques before training the language and the classification model. We further provide detailed analysis of the results obtained using the trained model. Our team ranked 10th out of 34 participants, achieving an F1 score of 0.7011. We publicly share our implementation at https://github.com/isarth/SemEval9_MIDAS
