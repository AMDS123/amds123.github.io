##### Abstract
In this study, we present a hierarchical fuzzy system by evaluating the risk state for a Driver Assistance System in order to contribute in reducing the road accident's number. A key component of this system is its ability to continually detect and test the inside and outside risks in real time: The outside car risks by detecting various road moving objects; this proposed system stands on computer vision approaches. The inside risks by presenting an automatic system for drowsy driving identification or detection by evaluating EEG signals of the driver; this developed system is based on computer vision techniques and biometrics factors (electroencephalogram EEG). This proposed system is then composed of three main modules. The first module is responsible for identifying the driver drowsiness state through his eye movements (physical drowsiness). The second one is responsible for detecting and analysing his physiological signals to also identify his drowsiness state (moral drowsiness). The third module is responsible to evaluate the road driving risks by detecting of the road different moving objects in a real time. The final decision will be obtained by merging of the three detection systems through the use of fuzzy decision rules. Finally, the proposed approach has been improved on ten samples from a proposed dataset.

在这项研究中，我们通过评估驾驶员辅助系统的风险状态来呈现分级模糊系统，以便有助于减少道路事故的发生次数。该系统的一个关键组成部分是能够实时持续检测和测试内部和外部风险：外部车辆通过检测各种道路移动物体而面临风险;这个提议的系统是计算机视觉方法。通过评估司机的脑电信号，提出一种自动驾驶识别系统或检测系统来防范内部风险;这个开发的系统基于计算机视觉技术和生物统计学因素（脑电图EEG）。这个建议的系统由三个主要模块组成。第一个模块负责通过他的眼球运动（身体困倦）来识别驾驶员困倦状态。第二个是负责检测和分析他的生理信号，以确定他的睡意状态（道德困倦）。第三个模块负责通过实时检测不同移动物体的道路来评估道路驾驶风险。最终决定将通过使用模糊决策规则合并三个检测系统来获得。最后，所提出的方法已经从提出的数据集的十个样本中得到改进。
