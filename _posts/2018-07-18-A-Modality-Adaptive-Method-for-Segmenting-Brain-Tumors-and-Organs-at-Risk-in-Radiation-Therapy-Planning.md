##### Abstract
In this paper we present a method for simultaneously segmenting brain tumors and an extensive set of organs-at-risk for radiation therapy planning of glioblastomas. The method combines a contrast-adaptive generative model for whole-brain segmentation with a new spatial regularization model of tumor shape using convolutional restricted Boltzmann machines. We demonstrate experimentally that the method is able to adapt to image acquisitions that differ substantially from any available training data, ensuring its applicability across treatment sites; that its tumor segmentation accuracy is comparable to that of the current state of the art; and that it captures most organs-at-risk sufficiently well for radiation therapy planning purposes. The proposed method may be a valuable step towards automating the delineation of brain tumors and organs-at-risk in glioblastoma patients undergoing radiation therapy.

在本文中，我们提出了一种同时分割脑肿瘤的方法和一套广泛的风险器官，用于胶质母细胞瘤的放射治疗计划。该方法结合了全脑分割的对比度自适应生成模型和使用卷积限制Boltzmann机器的肿瘤形状的新空间正则化模型。我们通过实验证明该方法能够适应与任何可用训练数据大不相同的图像采集，确保其在治疗部位的适用性;其肿瘤分割准确度与现有技术水平相当;并且它可以很好地捕获大多数风险器官用于放射治疗计划目的。所提出的方法可以是朝向经历放射疗法的胶质母细胞瘤患者中的脑肿瘤和风险器官的描绘自动化的有价值的步骤。
