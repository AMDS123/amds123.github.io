##### Abstract
Neural network based models commonly regard event detection as a word-wise classification task, which suffer from the mismatch problem between words and event triggers, especially in languages without natural word delimiters such as Chinese. In this paper, we propose Nugget Proposal Networks (NPNs), which can solve the word-trigger mismatch problem by directly proposing entire trigger nuggets centered at each character regardless of word boundaries. Specifically, NPNs perform event detection in a character-wise paradigm, where a hybrid representation for each character is first learned to capture both structural and semantic information from both characters and words. Then based on learned representations, trigger nuggets are proposed and categorized by exploiting character compositional structures of Chinese event triggers. Experiments on both ACE2005 and TAC KBP 2017 datasets show that NPNs significantly outperform the state-of-the-art methods.

基于神经网络的模型通常把事件检测看作是一个单词分类任务，它受到单词和事件触发器之间的不匹配问题的困扰，特别是在没有自然词分隔符如中文的语言中。在本文中，我们提出了金块建议网络（NPNs），它可以通过直接提出以每个字符为中心的整个触发块而不考虑字边界来解决字 - 触发器不匹配问题。具体而言，NPNs以字符方式执行事件检测，其中首先学习每个字符的混合表示，以从字符和单词中捕获结构和语义信息。然后基于学习表征，利用中国事件触发器的人物组成结构提出并分类触发金块。 ACE2005和TAC KBP 2017数据集上的实验表明，NPNs显着优于最先进的方法。
