##### Abstract
In this paper, we present a graph-based semi-supervised framework for hyperspectral image classification. We first introduce a novel superpixel algorithm based on the spectral covariance matrix representation of pixels to provide a better representation of our data. We then construct a superpixel graph, based on carefully considered feature vectors, before performing classification. We demonstrate, through a set of experimental results using two benchmarking datasets, that our approach outperforms three state-of-the-art classification frameworks, especially when an extremely small amount of labelled data is used.
