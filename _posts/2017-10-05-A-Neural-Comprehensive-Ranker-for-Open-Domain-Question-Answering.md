##### Abstract
This paper proposes a novel neural machine reading model for open-domain question answering at scale. Existing machine comprehension models typically assume that a short piece of relevant text containing answers is already identified and given to the models, from which the models are designed to extract answers. This assumption, however, is not realistic for building a large-scale open-domain question answering system which requires both deep text understanding and identifying relevant text from corpus simultaneously. In this paper, we introduce Neural Comprehensive Ranker (NCR) that integrates both passage ranking and answer extraction in one single framework. A Q&A system based on this framework allows users to issue an open-domain question without needing to provide a piece of text that must contain the answer. Experiments show that the unified NCR model is able to outperform the states-of-the-art in both retrieval of relevant text and answer extraction.

本文提出了一种新的大规模开放式问题解答的神经机器阅读模型。现有的机器理解模型通常假定包含答案的相关文本的短片已经被识别并且被提供给模型，从中提取模型来提取答案。然而，这个假设对于建立一个需要对文本进行深层理解并同时从语料库中识别相关文本的大规模开放域问答系统是不现实的。在本文中，我们引入神经综合排序器（NCR），将通道排序和答案提取整合到一个单一框架中。基于这个框架的Q＆A系统允许用户发布一个开放域名的问题，而不需要提供一个必须包含答案的文本。实验表明，统一的NCR模型在相关文本检索和回答提取方面都能够超越最新的技术水平。
