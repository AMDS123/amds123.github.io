##### Abstract
Representing 3D shape deformations by linear models in high-dimensional space has many applications in computer vision and medical imaging, such as shape-based interpolation or segmentation. Commonly, using Principal Components Analysis a low-dimensional (affine) subspace of the high-dimensional shape space is determined. However, the resulting factors (the most dominant eigenvectors of the covariance matrix) have global support, i.e. changing the coefficient of a single factor deforms the entire shape. In this paper, a method to obtain deformation factors with local support is presented. The benefits of such models include better flexibility and interpretability as well as the possibility of interactively deforming shapes locally. For that, based on a well-grounded theoretical motivation, we formulate a matrix factorisation problem employing sparsity and graph-based regularisation terms. We demonstrate that for brain shapes our method outperforms the state of the art in local support models with respect to generalisation ability and sparse shape reconstruction, whereas for human body shapes our method gives more realistic deformations.

在高维空间中利用线性模型来表示三维形状变形在计算机视觉和医学成像中具有许多应用，例如基于形状的插值或分割。通常，使用主成分分析确定高维形状空间的低维（仿射）子空间。然而，所得到的因素（协方差矩阵的最主要特征向量）具有全球支持，即改变单个因子的系数使整个形状变形。本文提出了一种获得局部支撑变形因子的方法。这些模型的好处包括更好的灵活性和可解释性，以及在本地交互式地变形形状的可能性。为此，基于扎实的理论动机，我们用稀疏性和基于图的正则化术语来制定矩阵分解问题。我们证明，对于大脑形状，我们的方法在局部支持模型方面的表现优于现有支持模型中关于泛化能力和稀疏形状重建的现有技术，而对于人体形状，我们的方法给出了更真实的变形。
