##### Abstract
The state of Singapore operates a national public housing program, accounting for over 80% of its residential real estate. Singapore uses its housing allocation program to ensure ethnic diversity in its neighborhoods; it does so by imposing ethnic quotas: every ethnic group must not own more than a certain percentage in a housing project, thus ensuring that every neighborhood contains members from each ethnic group. However, imposing diversity constraints naturally results in some welfare loss. Our work studies the tradeoff between diversity and social welfare from the perspective of computational economics. We model the problem as an extension of the classic assignment problem, with additional diversity constraints. While the classic assignment program is poly-time computable, we show that adding diversity constraints makes the problem computationally intractable; however, we identify a $\tfrac{1}{2}$-approximation algorithm, as well as reasonable agent utility models which admit poly-time algorithms. In addition, we study the price of diversity: this is the loss in welfare incurred by imposing diversity constraints; we provide upper bounds on the price of diversity as a function of natural problem parameters; next, we analyze public data from Singapore's Housing and Development Board, and create a simulated framework testing the welfare loss due to diversity constraints in realistic large-scale scenarios.

新加坡是一个国家公共住房项目，占其住宅房地产的80％以上。新加坡使用其住房分配方案，以确保其邻里的种族多样性;这是通过实行种族配额来实现的：每个民族在住房项目中所占的比例不能超过一定比例，从而确保每个社区都有来自各民族的成员。然而，施加多样性约束自然会造成一些福利损失。我们的工作从计算经济学的角度来研究多样性与社会福利之间的权衡。我们将问题建模为经典分配问题的扩展，并增加了多样性约束。虽然经典的分配程序是多时间可计算的，但是我们表明，添加多样性约束使得问题在计算上难以处理;然而，我们确定一个$ \ tfrac {1} {2} $  - 近似算法，以及允许多时间算法的合理代理模型。另外，我们研究多样性的价格：这是由于多样性制约而造成的福利损失;我们提供作为自然问题参数函数的多样性价格的上限;接下来，我们分析了新加坡住房和发展委员会的公共数据，并创建了一个模拟的框架来测试在现实的大规模情景下由于多样性制约而造成的福利损失。
