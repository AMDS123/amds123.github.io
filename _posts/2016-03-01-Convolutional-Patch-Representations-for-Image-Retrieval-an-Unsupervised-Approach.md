##### Abstract
Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have recently received a lot of attention due to their ability to model local stationary structures in natural images in a multi-scale fashion, when learning all model parameters with supervision. While excellent performance was achieved for image classification when large amounts of labeled visual data are available, their success for un-supervised tasks such as image retrieval has been moderate so far. Our paper focuses on this latter setting and explores several methods for learning patch descriptors without supervision with application to matching and instance-level retrieval. To that effect, we propose a new family of convolutional descriptors for patch representation , based on the recently introduced convolutional kernel networks. We show that our descriptor, named Patch-CKN, performs better than SIFT as well as other convolutional networks learned by artificially introducing supervision and is significantly faster to train. To demonstrate its effectiveness, we perform an extensive evaluation on standard benchmarks for patch and image retrieval where we obtain state-of-the-art results. We also introduce a new dataset called RomePatches, which allows to simultaneously study descriptor performance for patch and image retrieval.

卷积神经网络（CNN）最近受到了很多关注，因为它们能够以多尺度的方式对自然图像中的局部静止结构进行建模，在监督下学习所有的模型参数。当大量标记的视觉数据可用时，虽然图像分类取得了优异的性能，但是迄今为止它们在非监督任务（如图像检索）方面的成功还是比较温和的。本文重点研究后一种情况，并探讨了几种无需监督的情况下学习补丁描述符的方法，以及应用于匹配和实例级检索的方法。为此，我们基于最近引入的卷积核心网络，提出了一种用于补丁表示的新的卷积描述符族。我们表明，我们的描述符，名为Patch-CKN，比SIFT以及通过人为地引入监督而学习的其他卷积网络执行得更好，训练速度明显更快。为了证明其有效性，我们对贴片和图像检索的标准基准进行了广泛的评估，获得了最新的结果。我们还引入了一个名为RomePatches的新数据集，它允许同时研究描述符在补丁和图像检索中的性能。
