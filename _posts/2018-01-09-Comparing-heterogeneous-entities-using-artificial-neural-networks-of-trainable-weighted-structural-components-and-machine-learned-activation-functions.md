##### Abstract
To compare entities of differing types and structural components, the artificial neural network paradigm was used to cross-compare structural components between heterogeneous documents. Trainable weighted structural components were input into machine-learned activation functions of the neurons. The model was used for matching news articles and videos, where the inputs and activation functions respectively consisted of term vectors and cosine similarity measures between the weighted structural components. The model was tested with different weights, achieving as high as 59.2% accuracy for matching videos to news articles. A mobile application user interface for recommending related videos for news articles was developed to demonstrate consumer value, including its potential usefulness for cross-selling products from unrelated categories.

为了比较不同类型和结构元素的实体，人工神经网络范式被用来对异构文档之间的结构组件进行交叉比较。可训练的加权结构组件被输入到神经元的机器学习激活函数中。该模型被用于匹配新闻文章和视频，其输入和激活函数分别由加权结构组件之间的项矢量和余弦相似性度量组成。该模型经过了不同的权重测试，对于将视频与新闻文章进行匹配的准确率达到了59.2％。用于推荐新闻文章的相关视频的移动应用程序用户界面被开发用于展示消费者的价值，包括其用于来自不相关类别的交叉销售产品的潜在用途。
