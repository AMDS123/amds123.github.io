##### Abstract
This is the proposal for RumourEval-2019, which will run in early 2019 as part of that year's SemEval event. Since the first RumourEval shared task in 2017, interest in automated claim validation has greatly increased, as the dangers of "fake news" have become a mainstream concern. Yet automated support for rumour checking remains in its infancy. For this reason, it is important that a shared task in this area continues to provide a focus for effort, which is likely to increase. We therefore propose a continuation in which the veracity of further rumours is determined, and as previously, supportive of this goal, tweets discussing them are classified according to the stance they take regarding the rumour. Scope is extended compared with the first RumourEval, in that the dataset is substantially expanded to include Reddit as well as Twitter data, and additional languages are also included.

##### Abstract (translated by Google)
这是RumourEval-2019的提案，将于2019年初作为当年SemEval活动的一部分。自2017年第一次RumourEval共享任务以来，对自动声明验证的兴趣大大增加，因为“假新闻”的危险已成为主流关注点。然而，对谣言检查的自动支持仍处于起步阶段。出于这个原因，重要的是该领域的共同任务继续提供工作重点，这可能会增加。因此，我们提出了一个继续，其中确定了进一步谣言的真实性，并且如前所述，支持这一目标，讨论它们的推文根据他们对谣言采取的立场进行分类。与第一个RumourEval相比，范围得到了扩展，因为数据集大大扩展到包括Reddit和Twitter数据，还包括其他语言。
