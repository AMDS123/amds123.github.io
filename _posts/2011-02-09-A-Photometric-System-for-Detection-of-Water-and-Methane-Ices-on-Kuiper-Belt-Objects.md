##### Abstract
We present a new near-infrared photometric system for detection of water ice and methane ice in the solar system. The system consists of two medium-band filters in the K-band region of the near-infrared, which are sensitive to water ice and methane ice, plus continuum observations in the J-band and Y-band. The primary purpose of this system is to distinguish between three basic types of Kuiper Belt Objects (KBOs) --- those rich in water ice, those rich in methane ice, and those with little absorbance. In this work, we present proof-of-concept observations of 51 KBOs using our filter system, 21 of which have never been observed in the near-IR spectroscopically. We show that our custom photometric system is consistent with previous spectroscopic observations while reducing telescope observing time by a factor of 3. We use our filters to identify Haumea collisional family members, which are thought to be collisional remnants of a much larger body and are characterized by large fractions of water ice on their surfaces. We add 2009 YE7 to the Haumea collisional family based on our water ice band observations(J-H2O = -1.03 +/- 0.27) which indicate a high amount of water ice absorption, our calculated proper orbital elements, and the neutral optical colors we measured, V-R = 0.38 +/- 0.04, which are all consistent with the rest of the Haumea family. We identify several objects dynamically similar to Haumea as being distinct from the Haumea family as they do not have water ice on their surfaces. In addition, we find that only the largest KBOs have methane ice, and we find that Haumea itself has significantly less water ice absorption than the smaller Haumea family members. We find no evidence for other families in the Kuiper Belt.

我们提出了一个新的近红外光度测量系统，用于检测太阳系中的水冰和甲烷冰。该系统由近红外K波段的两个中波段滤波器组成，它们对水冰和甲烷冰敏感，加上J波段和Y波段的连续谱观测。这个系统的主要目的是区分柯伊伯带体（KBO）的三种基本类型 - 那些富含水冰，那些富含甲烷的冰和那些吸收很少的。在这项工作中，我们使用我们的过滤系统提出了51个KBO的概念验证观测结果，其中21个从未在近红外光谱中观察到。我们表明，我们的自定义光度测量系统与以前的光谱观测是一致的，同时将望远镜观测时间减少了3倍。我们使用我们的滤波器来识别Haumea碰撞家庭成员，这些成员被认为是更大的碰撞残余物，在它们的表面上大部分水冰。根据我们的水冰观测（J-H2O = -1.03 +/- 0.27），我们在Haumea碰撞家庭中增加了2009年的YE7，这表明水冰的吸收量很高，我们计算的合适轨道元素和中性光学色测量，VR = 0.38 +/- 0.04，这与Haumea家族的其余部分一致。我们确定了几个与Haumea动态相似的物体，与Haumea家族不同，因为它们的表面没有水冰。另外，我们发现只有最大的KBO有甲烷冰，我们发现Haumea本身的吸冰量比较小的Haumea家族成员要少得多。我们在柯伊伯带找不到其他家庭的证据。
