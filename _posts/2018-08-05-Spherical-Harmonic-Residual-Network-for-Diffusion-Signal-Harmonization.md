##### Abstract
Diffusion imaging is an important method in the field of neuroscience, as it is sensitive to changes within the tissue microstructure of the human brain. However, a major challenge when using MRI to derive quantitative measures is that the use of different scanners, as used in multi-site group studies, introduces measurement variability. This can lead to an increased variance in quantitative metrics, even if the same brain is scanned. Contrary to the assumption that these characteristics are comparable and similar, small changes in these values are observed in many clinical studies, hence harmonization of the signals is essential. In this paper, we present a method that does not require additional preprocessing, such as segmentation or registration, and harmonizes the signal based on a deep learning residual network. For this purpose, a training database is required, which consist of the same subjects, scanned on different scanners. The results show that harmonized signals are significantly more similar to the ground truth signal compared to no harmonization, but also improve in comparison to another deep learning method. The same effect is also demonstrated in commonly used metrics derived from the diffusion MRI signal.

扩散成像是神经科学领域的一种重要方法，因为它对人脑组织微观结构的变化很敏感。然而，使用MRI推导定量测量时的一个主要挑战是，如多站点组研究中所使用的不同扫描仪的使用引入了测量可变性。即使扫描相同的大脑，这也可能导致定量指标的变化增加。与这些特征具有可比性和相似性的假设相反，在许多临床研究中观察到这些值的微小变化，因此信号的协调是必要的。在本文中，我们提出了一种不需要额外预处理的方法，例如分段或配准，并基于深度学习残差网络协调信号。为此，需要一个训练数据库，该数据库由在不同扫描仪上扫描的相同主题组成。结果表明，与没有协调相比，协调信号与地面实况信号明显更相似，但与另一种深度学习方法相比也有所改善。在从扩散MRI信号导出的常用度量中也证明了相同的效果。
