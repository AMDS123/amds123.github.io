##### Abstract
Recent research has widely explored the problem of aesthetics assessment of images with generic content. However, few approaches have been specifically designed to predict the aesthetic quality of images containing human faces, which make up a massive portion of photos in the web. This paper introduces a method for aesthetic quality assessment of images with faces. We exploit three different Convolutional Neural Networks to encode information regarding perceptual quality, global image aesthetics, and facial attributes; then, a model is trained to combine these features to explicitly predict the aesthetics of images containing faces. Experimental results show that our approach outperforms existing methods for both binary, i.e. low/high, and continuous aesthetic score prediction on four different databases in the state-of-the-art.

最近的研究已经广泛地探索了通用内容的图像美学评估问题。然而，很少有方法专门用来预测包含人脸的图像的美学质量，这些人脸构成网络中大量的照片。本文介绍了一种面部图像美学质量评估方法。我们利用三种不同的卷积神经网络来编码有关感知质量，全局图像美学和面部属性的信息;然后，训练模型以结合这些特征来明确地预测包含面部的图像的美学。实验结果表明，我们的方法在现有技术的四个不同数据库中优于现有的二进制（即低/高）审美评分预测方法。
