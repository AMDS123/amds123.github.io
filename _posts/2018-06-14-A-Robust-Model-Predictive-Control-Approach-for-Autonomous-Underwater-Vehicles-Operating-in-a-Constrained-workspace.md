##### Abstract
This paper presents a novel Nonlinear Model Predictive Control (NMPC) scheme for underwater robotic vehicles operating in a constrained workspace including static obstacles. The purpose of the controller is to guide the vehicle towards specific way points. Various limitations such as: obstacles, workspace boundary, thruster saturation and predefined desired upper bound of the vehicle velocity are captured as state and input constraints and are guaranteed during the control design. The proposed scheme incorporates the full dynamics of the vehicle in which the ocean currents are also involved. Hence, the control inputs calculated by the proposed scheme are formulated in a way that the vehicle will exploit the ocean currents, when these are in favor of the way-point tracking mission which results in reduced energy consumption by the thrusters. The performance of the proposed control strategy is experimentally verified using a $4$ Degrees of Freedom (DoF) underwater robotic vehicle inside a constrained test tank with obstacles.

本文提出了一种新颖的非线性模型预测控制（NMPC）方案，用于在包括静态障碍物的受限工作空间中操作的水下机器人车辆。控制器的目的是引导车辆走向特定的路点。诸如障碍物，工作空间边界，推进器饱和度和预定义的车速上限等各种限制被捕获为状态和输入约束，并且在控制设计期间被保证。所提出的方案结合了洋流也涉及的整个车辆动力学。因此，由拟议方案计算的控制输入以车辆将利用海流的方式制定，当这些控制输入有利于导航器的能量消耗减少的路点跟踪任务时。所提出的控制策略的性能通过在具有障碍物的受限测试箱内使用$ 4美元自由度（DoF）水下机器人车辆进行实验验证。
