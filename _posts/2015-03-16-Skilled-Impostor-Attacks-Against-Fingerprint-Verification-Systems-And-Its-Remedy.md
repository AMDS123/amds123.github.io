##### Abstract
Fingerprint verification systems are becoming ubiquitous in everyday life. This trend is propelled especially by the proliferation of mobile devices with fingerprint sensors such as smartphones and tablet computers, and fingerprint verification is increasingly applied for authenticating financial transactions. In this study we describe a novel attack vector against fingerprint verification systems which we coin skilled impostor attack. We show that existing protocols for performance evaluation of fingerprint verification systems are flawed and as a consequence of this, the system's real vulnerability is systematically underestimated. We examine a scenario in which a fingerprint verification system is tuned to operate at false acceptance rate of 0.1% using the traditional verification protocols with random impostors (zero-effort attacks). We demonstrate that an active and intelligent attacker can achieve a chance of success in the area of 89% or more against this system by performing skilled impostor attacks. We describe a new protocol for evaluating fingerprint verification performance in order to improve the assessment of potential and limitations of fingerprint recognition systems. This new evaluation protocol enables a more informed decision concerning the operating threshold in practical applications and the respective trade-off between security (low false acceptance rates) and usability (low false rejection rates). The skilled impostor attack is a general attack concept which is independent of specific databases or comparison algorithms. The proposed protocol relying on skilled impostor attacks can directly be applied for evaluating the verification performance of other biometric modalities such as e.g. iris, face, ear, finger vein, gait or speaker recognition.

指纹验证系统在日常生活中变得无处不在。特别是智能手机，平板电脑等指纹传感器的移动设备的普及，推动了这一趋势，指纹验证越来越多地应用于金融交易的认证。在这项研究中，我们描述了一种针对指纹验证系统的新型攻击媒介，我们对技术冒名顶替者进行了攻击我们发现现有的指纹验证系统性能评估协议是有缺陷的，由此导致系统的真实脆弱性被系统地低估。我们研究一个指纹验证系统被调整为使用传统验证协议和随机冒名顶替者（零攻击）以0.1％的错误接受率操作的情景。我们证明，一个积极和聪明的攻击者可以通过执行熟练的冒名顶替者攻击在这个系统的89％或更多的领域取得成功的机会。我们描述了一个评估指纹验证性能的新协议，以改善对指纹识别系统的潜力和局限性的评估。这个新的评估协议使得在实际应用中的操作阈值和在安全性（低错误接受率）和可用性（低错误拒绝率）之间的相应权衡做出更明智的决定。熟练的冒名顶替者攻击是一个普通的攻击概念，它独立于特定的数据库或比较算法。所提出的依靠熟练的冒名顶替者攻击的协议可以直接应用于评估其他生物特征模态的验证性能，例如，虹膜，面部，耳朵，手指静脉，步态或说话人识别。
