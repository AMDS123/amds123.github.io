##### Abstract
In traditional ELM and its improved versions suffer from the problems of outliers or noises due to overfitting and imbalance due to distribution. We propose a novel hybrid adaptive fuzzy ELM(HA-FELM), which introduces a fuzzy membership function to the traditional ELM method to deal with the above problems. We define the fuzzy membership function not only basing on the distance between each sample and the center of the class but also the density among samples which based on the quantum harmonic oscillator model. The proposed fuzzy membership function overcomes the shortcoming of the traditional fuzzy membership function and could make itself adjusted according to the specific distribution of different samples adaptively. Experiments show the proposed HA-FELM can produce better performance than SVM, ELM, and RELM in text classification.

在传统的ELM及其改进版本中，由于过度配合和分布不平衡而遭受异常值或噪声问题。我们提出了一种新颖的混合自适应模糊ELM（HA-FELM），它将传统的ELM方法引入模糊隶属函数来处理上述问题。我们不仅基于每个样本与类别中心之间的距离定义了模糊隶属函数，而且还基于量子谐振子模型定义了样本间的密度。所提出的模糊隶属度函数克服了传统模糊隶属度函数的缺点，可以根据不同样本的具体分布自适应地进行调整。实验表明，所提出的HA-FELM在文本分类中可以产生比SVM，ELM和RELM更好的性能。
