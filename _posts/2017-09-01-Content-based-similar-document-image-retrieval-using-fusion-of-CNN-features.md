##### Abstract
Rapid increase of digitized document give birth to high demand of document image retrieval. While conventional document image retrieval approaches depend on complex OCR-based text recognition and text similarity detection, this paper proposes a new content-based approach, in which more attention is paid to features extraction and fusion. In the proposed approach, multiple features of document images are extracted by different CNN models. After that, the extracted CNN features are reduced and fused into weighted average feature. Finally, the document images are ranked based on feature similarity to a provided query image. Experimental procedure is performed on a group of document images that transformed from academic papers, which contain both English and Chinese document, the results show that the proposed approach has good ability to retrieve document images with similar text content, and the fusion of CNN features can effectively improve the retrieval accuracy.

数字文件的快速增长催生了文件图像检索的高要求。虽然传统的文档图像检索方法依赖于基于OCR的复杂文本识别和文本相似度检测，但是本文提出了一种新的基于内容的方法，其中对特征提取和融合进行了更多的关注。在所提出的方法中，通过不同的CNN模型提取文档图像的多个特征。之后，提取的CNN特征被降低并融合成加权平均特征。最后，基于与提供的查询图像的特征相似度对文档图像进行排序。实验步骤是对一组文档图像进行变换，包含中英文文档的学术论文，结果表明，该方法具有很好的检索相似文本内容的文档图像的能力，并且CNN特征的融合可以有效提高检索的准确性。
