##### Abstract
Recently, with the enormous growth of online videos, fast video retrieval research has received increasing attention. As an extension of image hashing techniques, traditional video hashing methods mainly depend on hand-crafted features and transform the real-valued features into binary hash codes. As videos provide far more diverse and complex visual information than images, extracting features from videos is much more challenging than that from images. Therefore, high-level semantic features to represent videos are needed rather than low-level hand-crafted methods. In this paper, a deep convolutional neural network is proposed to extract high-level semantic features and a binary hash function is then integrated into this framework to achieve an end-to-end optimization. Particularly, our approach also combines triplet loss function which preserves the relative similarity and difference of videos and classification loss function as the optimization objective. Experiments have been performed on two public datasets and the results demonstrate the superiority of our proposed method compared with other state-of-the-art video retrieval methods.

近年来，随着在线视频的大量增长，视频快速检索研究受到越来越多的关注。作为图像哈希技术的扩展，传统的视频哈希方法主要依赖于手工特征，将实值特征转化为二值哈希码。由于视频提供的视觉信息要比图像多得多，复杂，因此从视频中提取特征要比从图像中提取特征要困难得多。因此，需要表示视频的高级语义特征而不是低级别的手工方法。本文提出了深层卷积神经网络来提取高层次的语义特征，然后将二叉散列函数整合到该框架中，实现端到端的优化。特别是，我们的方法还结合了保留视频的相对相似性和差异性的三重丢失函数和分类损失函数作为优化目标。已经对两个公共数据集进行了实验，结果证明了我们提出的方法与其他最先进的视频检索方法相比的优越性。
