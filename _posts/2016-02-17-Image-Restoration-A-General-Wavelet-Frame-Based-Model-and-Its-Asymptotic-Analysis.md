##### Abstract
Image restoration is one of the most important areas in imaging science. Mathematical tools have been widely used in image restoration, where wavelet frame based approach is one of the successful examples. In this paper, we introduce a generic wavelet frame based image restoration model, called the "general model", which includes most of the existing wavelet frame based models as special cases. Moreover, the general model also includes examples that are new to the literature. Motivated by our earlier studies [1-3], We provide an asymptotic analysis of the general model as image resolution goes to infinity, which establishes a connection between the general model in discrete setting and a new variatonal model in continuum setting. The variational model also includes some of the existing variational models as special cases, such as the total generalized variational model proposed by [4]. In the end, we introduce an algorithm solving the general model and present one numerical simulation as an example.

图像恢复是成像科学中最重要的领域之一。数学工具已被广泛应用于图像复原，其中基于小波框架的方法是成功的例子之一。在本文中，我们介绍一种基于小波框架的通用图像恢复模型，称为“通用模型”，其中包括大部分已有的基于小波框架的模型作为特例。而且，通用模型还包括对于文献而言新的例子。受到我们早期的研究[1-3]的启发，我们对图像分辨率趋于无穷大时的一般模型进行了渐近分析，建立了离散设置的一般模型与连续设置的新的多变量模型之间的联系。变分模型也包括一些现有的变分模型作为特例，如[4]提出的全广义变分模型。最后，介绍了求解该通用模型的算法，并给出了一个数值模拟的算例。
