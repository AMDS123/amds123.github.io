##### Abstract
The dominant approach for many NLP tasks are recurrent neural networks, in particular LSTMs, and convolutional neural networks. However, these architectures are rather shallow in comparison to the deep convolutional networks which have pushed the state-of-the-art in computer vision. We present a new architecture (VDCNN) for text processing which operates directly at the character level and uses only small convolutions and pooling operations. We are able to show that the performance of this model increases with depth: using up to 29 convolutional layers, we report improvements over the state-of-the-art on several public text classification tasks. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that very deep convolutional nets have been applied to text processing.

许多NLP任务的主导方法是递归神经网络，特别是LSTM和卷积神经网络。然而，与推动计算机视觉领域的深度卷积网络相比，这些架构相当浅薄。我们提出了一个新的架构（VDCNN）的文字处理，直接在字符级运作，只使用小卷积和池操作。我们能够证明这个模型的性能随着深度的增加而增加：使用多达29个卷积层，我们报告了几个公共文本分类任务的最新进展。就我们所知，这是第一次将非常深的卷积网应用于文本处理。
