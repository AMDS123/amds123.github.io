##### Abstract
We address the problem of inferring the causal direction between two variables by comparing the least-squares errors of the predictions in both possible directions. Under the assumption of an independence between the function relating cause and effect, the conditional noise distribution, and the distribution of the cause, we show that the errors are smaller in causal direction if both variables are equally scaled and the causal relation is close to deterministic. Based on this, we provide an easily applicable algorithm that only requires a regression in both possible causal directions and a comparison of the errors. The performance of the algorithm is compared with various related causal inference methods in different artificial and real-world data sets.
