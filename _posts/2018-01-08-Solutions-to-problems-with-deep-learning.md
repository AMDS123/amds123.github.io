##### Abstract
Despite the several successes of deep learning systems, there are concerns about their limitations, discussed most recently by Gary Marcus. This paper discusses Marcus's concerns and some others, together with solutions to several of these problems provided by the "P theory of intelligence" and its realisation in the "SP computer model". The main advantages of the SP system are: relatively small requirements for data and the ability to learn from a single experience; the ability to model both hierarchical and non-hierarchical structures; strengths in several kinds of reasoning, including `commonsense' reasoning; transparency in the representation of knowledge, and the provision of an audit trail for all processing; the likelihood that the SP system could not be fooled into bizarre or eccentric recognition of stimuli, as deep learning systems can be; the SP system provides a robust solution to the problem of `catastrophic forgetting' in deep learning systems; the SP system provides a theoretically-coherent solution to the problems of correcting over- and under-generalisations in learning, and learning correct structures despite errors in data; unlike most research on deep learning, the SP programme of research draws extensively on research on human learning, perception, and cognition; and the SP programme of research has an overarching theory, supported by evidence, something that is largely missing from research on deep learning. In general, the SP system provides a much firmer foundation than deep learning for the development of artificial general intelligence.

尽管深度学习系统取得了一些成功，但是Gary Marcus最近讨论了他们的局限性。本文讨论了马库斯关心的问题以及其他一些问题，并结合“智能P理论”提出的若干问题的解决方案及其在“SP计算机模型”中的实现。 SP系统的主要优点是：对数据的要求相对较小，能够从单一经验中学习;模拟分层结构和非分层结构的能力;包括“常识”推理在内的几种推理的优势;知识表示的透明度，以及为所有处理提供审计跟踪;就像深度学习系统一样，SP系统不可能被愚弄或怪异地识别刺激， SP系统为深度学习系统中的“灾难性遗忘”问题提供了强有力的解决方案; SP系统提供了一个理论上一致的解决方案，以纠正学习过度和不足的概括问题，并学习正确的结构，尽管数据错误;与大多数深度学习研究不同，SP研究方案广泛地研究人类学习，认知和认知;而SP研究项目有一个总体理论，有证据支持，这在深度学习的研究中很大程度上是缺失的。一般来说，SP系统比深度学习为人工智能的开发提供了更坚实的基础。
