##### Abstract
Reinforcement learning involves decision making in dynamic and uncertain environments and constitutes a crucial element of artificial intelligence. In our previous work, we experimentally demonstrated that the ultrafast chaotic oscillatory dynamics of lasers can be used to solve the two-armed bandit problem efficiently, which requires decision making concerning a class of difficult trade-offs called the exploration-exploitation dilemma. However, only two selections were employed in that research; thus, the scalability of the laser-chaos-based reinforcement learning should be clarified. In this study, we demonstrated a scalable, pipelined principle of resolving the multi-armed bandit problem by introducing time-division multiplexing of chaotically oscillated ultrafast time-series. The experimental demonstrations in which bandit problems with up to 64 arms were successfully solved are presented in this report. Detailed analyses are also provided that include performance comparisons among laser chaos signals generated in different physical conditions, which coincide with the diffusivity inherent in the time series. This study paves the way for ultrafast reinforcement learning by taking advantage of the ultrahigh bandwidths of light wave and practical enabling technologies.

强化学习涉及动态和不确定环境中的决策制定，并构成人工智能的关键要素。在我们以前的工作中，我们通过实验证明，激光的超快混沌振荡动力学可以用来有效地解决双臂强盗问题，这就需要有关一类称为勘探开发难题的难题取舍的决策。然而，这项研究只采用了两种选择;因此，激光混沌强化学习的可扩展性应该被阐明。在这项研究中，我们展示了一种可扩展的流水线原理，通过引入混沌振荡超快时间序列的时分复用来解决多臂强盗问题。本报告介绍了成功解决多达64只手臂的匪患问题的实验示范。还提供了详细的分析，包括在不同物理条件下产生的激光混沌信号之间的性能比较，这与在时间序列中固有的扩散性一致。这项研究利用超高带宽的光波和实用技术为超快强化学习铺平了道路。
