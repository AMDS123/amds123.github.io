##### Abstract
Lighting design and modelling %(the efficient and aesthetic placement of luminaires in a virtual or real scene) or industrial applications like luminaire planning and commissioning %(the luminaire's installation and evaluation process along to the scene's geometry and structure) rely heavily on physically correct simulations. The current typical approaches are based on CAD modeling simulations and offline rendering, with long processing times and therefore inflexible workflows. Thus, in this paper we propose a computer vision based system to measure lighting with just a single RGBD camera. The proposed method uses both depth data and images from the sensor to provide a dense measure of light intensity in the field of view of the camera.
