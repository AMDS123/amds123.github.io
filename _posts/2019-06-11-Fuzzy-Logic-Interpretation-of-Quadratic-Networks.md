##### Abstract
Over past several years, deep learning has achieved huge successes in various applications. However, such a data-driven approach is often criticized for lack of interpretability. Recently, we proposed artificial quadratic neural networks consisting of second-order neurons in potentially many layers. In each second-order neuron, a quadratic function is used in the place of the inner product in a traditional neuron, and then undergoes a nonlinear activation. With a single second-order neuron, any fuzzy logic operation, such as XOR, can be implemented. In this sense, any deep network constructed with quadratic neurons can be interpreted as a deep fuzzy logic system. Since traditional neural networks and second-order counterparts can represent each other and fuzzy logic operations are naturally implemented in second-order neural networks, it is plausible to explain how a deep neural network works with a second-order network as the system model. In this paper, we generalize and categorize fuzzy logic operations implementable with individual second-order neurons, and then perform statistical/information theoretic analyses of exemplary quadratic neural networks.
