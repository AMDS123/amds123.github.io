##### Abstract
One image processing application that is very helpful for humans is to improve image quality, poor image quality makes the image more difficult to interpret because the information conveyed by the image is reduced. In the process of the acquisition of medical images, the resulting image has decreased quality (degraded) due to external factors and medical equipment used. For this reason, it is necessary to have an image processing process to improve the quality of medical images, so that later it is expected to help facilitate medical personnel in analyzing and translating medical images, which will lead to an improvement in the quality of diagnosis. In this study, an analysis will be carried out to improve the quality of medical images with noise reduction with the Gaussian Filter Method. Next, it is carried out, and tested against medical images, in this case, the lung photo image. The test image is given noise in the form of impulse salt &amp; pepper and adaptive Gaussian then analyzed its performance qualitatively by comparing the output filter image, noise image, and the original image by naked eye.
