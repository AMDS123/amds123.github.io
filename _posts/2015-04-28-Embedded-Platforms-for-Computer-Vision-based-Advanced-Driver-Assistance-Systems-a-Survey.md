##### Abstract
Computer Vision, either alone or combined with other technologies such as radar or Lidar, is one of the key technologies used in Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS). Its role understanding and analysing the driving scene is of great importance as it can be noted by the number of ADAS applications that use this technology. However, porting a vision algorithm to an embedded automotive system is still very challenging, as there must be a trade-off between several design requisites. Furthermore, there is not a standard implementation platform, so different alternatives have been proposed by both the scientific community and the industry. This paper aims to review the requisites and the different embedded implementation platforms that can be used for Computer Vision-based ADAS, with a critical analysis and an outlook to future trends.

##### Abstract (translated by Google)
计算机视觉，单独或与其他技术，如雷达或激光雷达，是高级驾驶辅助系统（ADAS）中使用的关键技术之一。理解和分析驾驶场景的角色是非常重要的，因为使用这种技术的ADAS应用程序的数量可以被注意到。然而，将视觉算法移植到嵌入式汽车系统中仍然是非常具有挑战性的，因为必须在几个设计要求之间进行权衡。而且还没有一个标准的实施平台，所以科学界和工业界都提出了不同的选择方案。本文旨在回顾可用于基于计算机视觉的ADAS的必要性和不同的嵌入式实施平台，并对未来趋势进行批判性分析和展望。
