##### Abstract
Although neural networks could achieve state-of-the-art performance while recongnizing images, they often suffer a tremendous defeat from adversarial examples--inputs generated by utilizing imperceptible but intentional perturbation to clean samples from the datasets. How to defense against adversarial examples is an important problem which is well worth researching. So far, very few methods have provided a significant defense to adversarial examples. In this paper, a novel idea is proposed and an effective framework based Generative Adversarial Nets named APE-GAN is implemented to defense against the adversarial examples. The experimental results on three benchmark datasets including MNIST, CIFAR10 and ImageNet indicate that APE-GAN is effective to resist adversarial examples generated from five attacks.

虽然神经网络能够在识别图像的同时获得最先进的性能，但是它们经常遭受来自对抗性例子的巨大失败 - 通过利用不可察觉的但有意的扰动来清洁来自数据集的样本而产生的输入。如何防范敌对的例子是一个值得研究的重要问题。到目前为止，只有很少的方法为敌对的例子提供了重要的防御手段。本文提出了一种新颖的思路，并采用基于有效框架的生成对抗网络（APE-GAN）来防御对抗性实例。在MNIST，CIFAR10和ImageNet三个基准数据集上的实验结果表明，APE-GAN能有效抵抗五次攻击产生的对抗事例。
