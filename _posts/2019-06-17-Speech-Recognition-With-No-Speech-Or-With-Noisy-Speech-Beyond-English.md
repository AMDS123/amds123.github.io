##### Abstract
In this paper we demonstrate continuous noisy speech recognition using connectionist temporal classification (CTC) model on limited Chinese vocabulary using electroencephalography (EEG) features with no speech signal as input and we further demonstrate single CTC model based continuous noisy speech recognition on limited joint English and Chinese vocabulary using EEG features with no speech signal as input.
