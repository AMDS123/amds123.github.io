##### Abstract
We present a novel, robust sound source localization algorithm considering back-propagation signals. Sound propagation paths are estimated by generating direct and reflection acoustic rays based on ray tracing in a backward manner. We then compute the back-propagation signals by designing and using the impulse response of the backward sound propagation based on the acoustic ray paths. For identifying the 3D source position, we suggest a localization method based on the Monte Carlo localization algorithm. Candidates for a source position is determined by identifying the convergence regions of acoustic ray paths. This candidate is validated by measuring similarities between back-propagation signals, under the assumption that the back-propagation signals of different acoustic ray paths should be similar near the sound source position. Thanks to considering similarities of back-propagation signals, our approach can localize a source position with an averaged error of 0.51 m in a room of 7 m by 7 m area with 3 m height in tested environments. We also observe 65 % to 220 % improvement in accuracy over the stateof-the-art method. This improvement is achieved in environments containing a moving source, an obstacle, and noises.
