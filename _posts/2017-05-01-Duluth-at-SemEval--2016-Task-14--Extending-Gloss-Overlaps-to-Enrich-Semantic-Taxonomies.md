##### Abstract
This paper describes the Duluth systems that participated in Task 14 of SemEval 2016, Semantic Taxonomy Enrichment. There were three related systems in the formal evaluation which are discussed here, along with numerous post--evaluation runs. All of these systems identified synonyms between WordNet and other dictionaries by measuring the gloss overlaps between them. These systems perform better than the random baseline and one post--evaluation variation was within a respectable margin of the median result attained by all participating systems.

##### Abstract (translated by Google)
本文描述了参加SemEval 2016任务14的Duluth系统，语义分类的丰富性。正式评估中有三个相关系统在这里进行讨论，还有许多后评估运行。所有这些系统通过测量WordNet和其他字典之间的光泽重叠来识别WordNet和其他字典之间的同义词。这些系统比随机基线表现更好，一个后评估变化在所有参与系统达到的中值结果的可观范围内。
