##### Abstract
Face recognition achieves exceptional success thanks to the emergence of deep learning. However, many contemporary face recognition models still perform relatively poor in processing profile faces compared to frontal faces. A key reason is that the number of frontal and profile training faces are highly imbalanced - there are extensively more frontal training samples compared to profile ones. In addition, it is intrinsically hard to learn a deep representation that is geometrically invariant to large pose variations. In this study, we hypothesize that there is an inherent mapping between frontal and profile faces, and consequently, their discrepancy in the deep representation space can be bridged by an equivariant mapping. To exploit this mapping, we formulate a novel Deep Residual EquivAriant Mapping (DREAM) block, which is capable of adaptively adding residuals to the input deep representation to transform a profile face representation to a canonical pose that simplifies recognition. The DREAM block consistently enhances the performance of profile face recognition for many strong deep networks, including ResNet models, without deliberately augmenting training data of profile faces. The block is easy to use, light-weight, and can be implemented with a negligible computational overhead.

由于深度学习的出现，人脸识别取得了非凡的成功。然而，与正面相比，许多当代人脸识别模型在处理人脸时仍然表现较差。一个关键的原因是正面和侧面训练面孔的数量高度不平衡 - 与侧面训练样本相比，正面训练样本更多。此外，从本质上来说，很难学习一个几何不变大的姿态变化的深度表示。在本研究中，我们假设前面和侧面之间存在固有的映射关系，因此它们在深度表示空间中的差异可以通过等变映射来弥补。为了利用这种映射，我们制定了一种新颖的深度残差等熵映射（DREAM）块，它能够自适应地将残差添加到输入深度表示中，以便将简档脸部表示转换为简化识别的典型姿态。 DREAM模块不断强化许多强大深度网络（包括ResNet模型）的轮廓人脸识别性能，而不会有意增加轮廓面的训练数据。该块易于使用，重量轻，并且可以用可忽略的计算开销来实现。
