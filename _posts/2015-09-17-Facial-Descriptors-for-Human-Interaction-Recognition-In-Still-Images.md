##### Abstract
This paper presents a novel approach in a rarely studied area of computer vision: Human interaction recognition in still images. We explore whether the facial regions and their spatial configurations contribute to the recognition of interactions. In this respect, our method involves extraction of several visual features from the facial regions, as well as incorporation of scene characteristics and deep features to the recognition. Extracted multiple features are utilized within a discriminative learning framework for recognizing interactions between people. Our designed facial descriptors are based on the observation that relative positions, size and locations of the faces are likely to be important for characterizing human interactions. Since there is no available dataset in this relatively new domain, a comprehensive new dataset which includes several images of human interactions is collected. Our experimental results show that faces and scene characteristics contain important information to recognize interactions between people.

本文提出了一种新颖的方法在一个很少研究的计算机视觉领域：静止图像中的人类交互识别。我们探讨面部区域及其空间配置是否有助于识别相互作用。在这方面，我们的方法涉及从面部区域提取几个视觉特征，以及将场景特征和深度特征结合到识别中。在识别性学习框架内使用提取的多个特征来识别人与人之间的交互。我们设计的面部描述符是基于这样的观察：面部的相对位置，大小和位置对于表征人类相互作用可能是重要的。由于在这个相对较新的领域没有可用的数据集，因此收集了包括多个人类交互图像的全面的新数据集。我们的实验结果表明，人脸和场景特征包含重要的信息来识别人与人之间的交互。
