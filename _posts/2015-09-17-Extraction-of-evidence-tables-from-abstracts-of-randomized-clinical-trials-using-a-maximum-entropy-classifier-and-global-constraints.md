##### Abstract
Systematic use of the published results of randomized clinical trials is increasingly important in evidence-based medicine. In order to collate and analyze the results from potentially numerous trials, evidence tables are used to represent trials concerning a set of interventions of interest. An evidence table has columns for the patient group, for each of the interventions being compared, for the criterion for the comparison (e.g. proportion who survived after 5 years from treatment), and for each of the results. Currently, it is a labour-intensive activity to read each published paper and extract the information for each field in an evidence table. There have been some NLP studies investigating how some of the features from papers can be extracted, or at least the relevant sentences identified. However, there is a lack of an NLP system for the systematic extraction of each item of information required for an evidence table. We address this need by a combination of a maximum entropy classifier, and integer linear programming. We use the later to handle constraints on what is an acceptable classification of the features to be extracted. With experimental results, we demonstrate substantial advantages in using global constraints (such as the features describing the patient group, and the interventions, must occur before the features describing the results of the comparison).

##### Abstract (translated by Google)
系统地使用随机临床试验公布的结果在循证医学中越来越重要。为了整理和分析可能的大量试验的结果，使用证据表来表示关于一组感兴趣的干预的试验。证据表具有用于患者组的列，用于比较的每种干预，用于比较的标准（例如，治疗5年后存活的比例）和每个结果。目前，阅读每篇发表的论文并提取证据表中每个领域的信息是一项劳动密集型活动。有一些NLP研究调查了如何提取论文的一些特征，或至少是相关的句子。然而，缺乏用于系统提取证据表所需的每个信息的NLP系统。我们通过最大熵分类器和整数线性规划的组合来满足这个需求。我们使用后者来处理对可提取特征的可接受分类的限制。通过实验结果，我们证明在使用全局约束（例如描述患者组的特征和干预措施必须发生在描述比较结果的特征之前）方面具有实质优势。
