##### Abstract
Human Activity Recognition has witnessed a significant progress in the last decade. Although a great deal of work in this field goes in recognizing normal human activities, few studies focused on identifying motion in sports. Recognizing human movements in different sports has high impact on understanding the different styles of humans in the play and on improving their performance. As deep learning models proved to have good results in many classification problems, this paper will utilize deep learning to classify cross-country skiing movements, known as gears, collected using a 3D accelerometer. It will also provide a comparison between different deep learning models such as convolutional and recurrent neural networks versus standard multi-layer perceptron. Results show that deep learning is more effective and has the highest classification accuracy.

人类活动认可在过去的十年中取得了重大的进展。虽然这个领域的大量工作是在认识正常的人类活动，但是很少有研究集中于识别运动的运动。认识到不同体育运动中的人类运动，对于了解游戏中不同风格的人物以及提高他们的表现有很大的影响。由于深度学习模型在许多分类问题中被证明具有良好的效果，本文将利用深度学习对越野滑雪运动进行分类，称为齿轮，采用三维加速度计进行采集。它还将提供不同深度学习模型（如卷积和递归神经网络）与标准多层感知器之间的比较。结果表明，深度学习更有效，分类精度最高。
