##### Abstract
We introduce a new regularizer in the total variation family that promotes reconstructions with a given Lipschitz constant (which can also vary spatially). We prove regularizing properties of this functional and investigate its connections to total variation and infimal convolution type regularizers TVLp and, in particular, establish topological equivalence. Our numerical experiments show that the proposed regularizer can achieve similar performance as total generalized variation while having the advantage of a very intuitive interpretation of its free parameter, which is just a local estimate of the norm of the gradient. It also provides a natural approach to spatially adaptive regularization.
