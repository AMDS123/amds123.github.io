##### Abstract
This work is dedicated to introducing, executing, and assessing a three-stage speaker verification framework to enhance the degraded speaker verification performance in emotional talking environments. Our framework is comprised of three cascaded stages: gender identification stage followed by an emotion identification stage followed by a speaker verification stage. The proposed framework has been assessed on two distinct and independent emotional speech datasets: our collected dataset and Emotional Prosody Speech and Transcripts dataset. Our results demonstrate that speaker verification based on both gender cues and emotion cues is superior to each of speaker verification based on gender cues only, emotion cues only, and neither gender cues nor emotion cues. The achieved average speaker verification performance based on the suggested methodology is very similar to that attained in subjective assessment by human listeners.

这项工作致力于引入，执行和评估三阶段说话者验证框架，以提高情绪说话环境中降低的说话者验证性能。我们的框架由三个级联阶段组成：性别识别阶段，然后是情绪识别阶段，然后是演讲者验证阶段。所提出的框架已经在两个不同且独立的情感语音数据集上进行评估：我们收集的数据集和情感韵律语音和转录数据集。我们的结果表明，基于性别线索和情绪线索的说话者验证优于仅基于性别线索的说话者验证，仅情绪线索，以及既不是性别线索也不是情绪线索。基于所提出的方法所实现的平均说话者验证性能与人类听众的主观评估中所达到的非常相似。
