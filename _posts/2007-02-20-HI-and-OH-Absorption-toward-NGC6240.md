##### Abstract
VLA observations of large-scale HI and OH absorption in the merging galaxy of NGC6240 are presented with 1 arcsec resolution. HI absorption is found across large areas of the extended radio continuum structure with a strong concentration towards the double-nucleus. The OH absorption is confined to the nuclear region. The HI and OH observations identify fractions of the gas disks of the two galaxies and confirm the presence of central gas accumulation between the nuclei. The data clearly identify the nucleus of the southern galaxy as the origin of the symmetric superwind outflow and also reveal blue-shifted components resulting from a nuclear starburst. Various absorption components are associated with large-scale dynamics of the system including a foreground dust lane crossing the radio structure in the northwest region.

##### Abstract (translated by Google)
在NGC6240的合并星系中，VLA对大规模HI和OH吸收的观测以1弧秒分辨率呈现。 HI吸收是在扩展的无线电连续体结构的大面积上发现的，并且强烈地集中在双核上。 OH吸收仅限于核区域。 HI和OH观测确定两个星系的气体盘的分数，并确认核之间存在中央气体积聚。这些数据清楚地表明南方星系的核心是对称性超风流出的来源，同时也揭示了由核爆星引起的蓝移分量。各种吸收成分与系统的大规模动力学有关，包括穿过西北地区无线电结构的前景沙尘道。
