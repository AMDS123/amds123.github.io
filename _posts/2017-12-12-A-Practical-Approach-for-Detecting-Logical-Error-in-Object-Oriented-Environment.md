##### Abstract
A programming language is a formally constructed language designed to communicate instructions to a machine, particularly a computer. Programming languages can be used to create programs to control the behavior of a machine or to express algorithms. Most programs that are written by programmers are often compiled correctly with no syntax or semantic errors. However, some other errors appear after the execution of the program (logical error). Logical Errors (LE) are errors that remain after all syntax errors have been removed. Usually, the compiler does not detect LE, so the produced results are different from what the programmer is expecting. For this reason, discovering and fixing the logical error is very hard and proposes a good topic for research and practice. Some LE are resulted from the misuse of classes' objects, and in Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC), it is considered that the software with LE is low-quality software with high maintenance cost. In this paper, an object-oriented environment that allows the programmer to detect and discover LE to avoid it. This environment will be called Object Behavior Environment (OBEnvironment) will enforce the correct use of objects according to their predefined behaviors by using tools like Xceed Component (that appeal .Net windows form developers for building better applications), Alsing Component (that provides an area to programmer that allows writing correct syntax code by C# language) and, Mind Fusion Component (that provides an area to programmer that allows drawing State Diagrams to show object state).

##### Abstract (translated by Google)
编程语言是一种正式构建的语言，旨在将指令传达给机器，特别是计算机。编程语言可用于创建程序来控制机器的行为或表达算法。大多数程序员编写的程序通常编译正确，没有语法或语义错误。但是，程序执行后会出现其他一些错误（逻辑错误）。逻辑错误（LE）是在删除所有语法错误后仍然存在的错误。通常，编译器不会检测LE，所以产生的结果与程序员所期望的不同。为此，发现和修正逻辑错误是非常困难的，并提出了一个很好的研究和实践的话题。有些LE是由于课堂对象的滥用造成的，在软件开发生命周期（Software Development Life Cycle，SDLC）中，认为LE软件是低维护成本较高的软件。在本文中，一个面向对象的环境允许程序员检测和发现LE以避免它。这个环境将被称为对象行为环境（OBEnvironment）将通过使用像Xceed组件这样的工具来强制正确使用对象（它呼吁.NET窗体开发人员用于构建更好的应用程序），Alching Component（提供一个区域到允许用C＃语言编写正确的语法代码的程序员）和Mind Fusion Component（为程序员提供一个区域，允许绘制状态图显示对象状态）。
