##### Abstract
Dropout Variational Inference, or Dropout Sampling, has been recently proposed as an approximation technique for Bayesian Deep Learning and evaluated for image classification and regression tasks. This paper investigates the utility of Dropout Sampling for object detection for the first time. We demonstrate how label uncertainty can be extracted from a state-of-the-art object detection system via Dropout Sampling. We show that this uncertainty can be utilized to increase object detection performance under the open-set conditions that are typically encountered in robotic vision. We evaluate this approach on a large synthetic dataset with 30,000 images, and a real-world dataset captured by a mobile robot in a versatile campus environment.

Dropout Variational Inference或Dropout Sampling最近被提出作为贝叶斯深度学习的一种近似技术，并被评估用于图像分类和回归任务。本文首次研究了Dropout Sampling技术在物体检测中的应用。我们演示了标签不确定性如何通过Dropout Sampling从最先进的物体检测系统中提取出来。我们表明，这种不确定性可以用来增加在机器人视觉中通常遇到的开放条件下的物体检测性能。我们在具有30,000个图像的大型合成数据集上评估这种方法，并且在多功能校园环境中由移动机器人捕获真实世界的数据集。
