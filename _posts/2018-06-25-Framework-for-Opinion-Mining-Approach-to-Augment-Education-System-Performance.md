##### Abstract
The extensive expansion growth of social networking sites allows the people to share their views and experiences freely with their peers on internet. Due to this, huge amount of data is generated on everyday basis which can be used for the opinion mining to extract the views of people in a particular field. Opinion mining finds its applications in many areas such as Tourism, Politics, education and entertainment, etc. It has not been extensively implemented in area of education system. This paper discusses the malpractices in the present examination system. In the present scenario, Opinion mining is vastly used for decision making. The authors of this paper have designed a framework by applying Na\"ive Bayes approach to the education dataset. The various phases of Na\"ive Bayes approach include three steps: conversion of data into frequency table, making classes of dataset and apply the Na\"ive Bayes algorithm equation to calculate the probabilities of classes. Finally the highest probability class is the outcome of this prediction. These predictions are used to make improvements in the education system and help to provide better education.

社交网站的广泛增长使得人们可以在互联网上与同龄人自由分享他们的观点和体验。因此，每天都会生成大量的数据，这些数据可用于意见挖掘以提取特定领域的人们的观点。意见挖掘在旅游，政治，教育，娱乐等诸多领域得到应用，在教育系统领域尚未得到广泛的实施。本文讨论了当前考试制度中的不当行为。在目前的情况下，意见挖掘广泛用于决策。本文的作者通过将贝叶斯方法应用于教育数据集设计了一个框架，Naive Bayes方法的各个阶段包括三个步骤：将数据转换为频率表，制作数据集类并应用使用贝叶斯算法方程计算类别的概率，最后得出最高的概率类别是预测的结果，这些预测用于改进教育系统并有助于提供更好的教育。
