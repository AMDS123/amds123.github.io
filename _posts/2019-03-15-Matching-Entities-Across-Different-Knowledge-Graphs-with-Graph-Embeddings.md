##### Abstract
This paper explores the problem of matching entities across different knowledge graphs. Given a query entity in one knowledge graph, we wish to find the corresponding real-world entity in another knowledge graph. We formalize this problem and present two large-scale datasets for this task based on exiting cross-ontology links between DBpedia and Wikidata, focused on several hundred thousand ambiguous entities. Using a classification-based approach, we find that a simple multi-layered perceptron based on representations derived from RDF2Vec graph embeddings of entities in each knowledge graph is sufficient to achieve high accuracy, with only small amounts of training data. The contributions of our work are datasets for examining this problem and strong baselines on which future work can be based.
