##### Abstract
In this paper, we propose a pixel-wise detector named TextCohesion for scene text detection especially for those with arbitrary shapes. TextChohesion splits a text instance into 5 key components: a Text Skeleton, and four Directional pixel Regions. These components are easy to handle rather than directly control the entire text instance. We also introduce a confidence scoring mechanism to filter out the characters that are similar to texts. Our method can integrate text contexts intensively even grasp clues when it is very complex background. Experiments on challenging benchmarks demonstrate that our TextCohesion clearly outperform state-of-the-art methods and it achieves an F-measure of 84.6 and 86.3 on Total-Text and SCUT-CTW1500 respectively.
