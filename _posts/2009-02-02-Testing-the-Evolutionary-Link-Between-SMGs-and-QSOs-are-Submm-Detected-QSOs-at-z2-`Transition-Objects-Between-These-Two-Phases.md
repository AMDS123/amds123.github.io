##### Abstract
Local spheroids show a relation between their masses and those of the super-massive black holes (SMBH) at their centres, indicating a link between the major phases of spheroid growth and nuclear accretion. These phases may correspond to high-z submillimetre galaxies (SMGs) and QSOs, separate populations with surprisingly similar redshift distributions which may both be phases in the life cycle of individual galaxies, with SMGs evolving into QSOs. Here we briefly discuss our recent results in Coppin et al. (2008), where we have tested this connection by weighing the black holes and mapping CO in submm-detected QSOs, which may be transition objects between the two phases, and comparing their baryonic, dynamical and Halpha-derived SMBH masses to those of SMGs at the same epoch.
