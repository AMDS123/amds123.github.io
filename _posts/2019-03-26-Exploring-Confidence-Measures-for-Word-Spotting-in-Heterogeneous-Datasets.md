##### Abstract
In recent years, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) took over the field of document analysis and they became the predominant model for word spotting. Especially attribute CNNs, which learn the mapping between a word image and an attribute representation, showed exceptional performances. The drawback of this approach is the overconfidence of neural networks when used out of their training distribution. In this paper, we explore different metrics for quantifying the confidence of a CNN in its predictions, specifically on the retrieval problem of word spotting. With these confidence measures, we limit the inability of a retrieval list to reject certain candidates. We investigate four different approaches that are either based on the network's attribute estimations or make use of a surrogate model. Our approach also aims at answering the question for which part of a dataset the retrieval system gives reliable results. We further show that there exists a direct relation between the proposed confidence measures and the quality of an estimated attribute representation.
