##### Abstract
3D Morphable Models (3DMMs) are powerful statistical models of 3D facial shape and texture, and among the state-of-the-art methods for reconstructing facial shape from single images. With the advent of new 3D sensors, many 3D facial datasets have been collected containing both neutral as well as expressive faces. However, all datasets are captured under controlled conditions. Thus, even though powerful 3D facial shape models can be learnt from such data, it is difficult to build statistical texture models that are sufficient to reconstruct faces captured in unconstrained conditions ("in-the-wild"). In this paper, we propose the first, to the best of our knowledge, "in-the-wild" 3DMM by combining a powerful statistical model of facial shape, which describes both identity and expression, with an "in-the-wild" texture model. We show that the employment of such an "in-the-wild" texture model greatly simplifies the fitting procedure, because there is no need to optimize with regards to the illumination parameters. Furthermore, we propose a new fast algorithm for fitting the 3DMM in arbitrary images. Finally, we have captured the first 3D facial database with relatively unconstrained conditions and report quantitative evaluations with state-of-the-art performance. Complementary qualitative reconstruction results are demonstrated on standard "in-the-wild" facial databases. An open source implementation of our technique is released as part of the Menpo Project.

##### Abstract (translated by Google)
3D形状模型（3DMorphs Models）（3DMM）是3D面部形状和纹理的强大统计模型，以及用于从单个图像重建面部形状的最先进的方法之中。随着新的三维传感器的出现，许多三维面部数据集已被收集包含中性和表现力的面孔。但是，所有数据集都是在受控条件下捕获的。因此，尽管可以从这样的数据中学习强大的3D面部形状模型，但是难以建立足以重建在无约束条件下捕捉的面部（“野外”）的统计纹理模型。在本文中，我们首先根据我们的知识提出“野外”3DMM，它将一个强大的面部形状统计模型与一个“在野外”描述身份和表情，纹理模型。我们表明，这种“野外”纹理模型的使用极大地简化了拟合程序，因为不需要针对照明参数进行优化。此外，我们提出了一种新的快速算法拟合3DMM在任意图像。最后，我们捕获了第一个三维面部数据库相对不受限制的条件，并报告定量评估与最先进的性能。在标准的“野外”面部数据库中展示了互补的定性重建结果。我们的技术的开源实现作为门坡项目的一部分发布。
