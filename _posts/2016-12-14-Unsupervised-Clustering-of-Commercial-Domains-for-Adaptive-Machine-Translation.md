##### Abstract
In this paper, we report on domain clustering in the ambit of an adaptive MT architecture. A standard bottom-up hierarchical clustering algorithm has been instantiated with five different distances, which have been compared, on an MT benchmark built on 40 commercial domains, in terms of dendrograms, intrinsic and extrinsic evaluations. The main outcome is that the most expensive distance is also the only one able to allow the MT engine to guarantee good performance even with few, but highly populated clusters of domains.

##### Abstract (translated by Google)
在本文中，我们报告了在自适应MT体系结构范围内的域聚类。标准的自下而上的层次聚类算法已经被实例化了五个不同的距离，已经在基于40个商业领域建立的MT基准上进行比较，就树状图，内在和外在评价而言。主要的结果是，最昂贵的距离也是唯一一个能够让MT引擎保证良好的性能，即使有少量，但人口稠密的域群。
