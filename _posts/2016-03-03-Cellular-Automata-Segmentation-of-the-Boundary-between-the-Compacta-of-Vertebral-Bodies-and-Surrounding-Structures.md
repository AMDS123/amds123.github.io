##### Abstract
Due to the aging population, spinal diseases get more and more common nowadays; e.g., lifetime risk of osteoporotic fracture is 40% for white women and 13% for white men in the United States. Thus the numbers of surgical spinal procedures are also increasing with the aging population and precise diagnosis plays a vital role in reducing complication and recurrence of symptoms. Spinal imaging of vertebral column is a tedious process subjected to interpretation errors. In this contribution, we aim to reduce time and error for vertebral interpretation by applying and studying the GrowCut-algorithm for boundary segmentation between vertebral body compacta and surrounding structures. GrowCut is a competitive region growing algorithm using cellular automata. For our study, vertebral T2-weighted Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) scans were first manually outlined by neurosurgeons. Then, the vertebral bodies were segmented in the medical images by a GrowCut-trained physician using the semi-automated GrowCut-algorithm. Afterwards, results of both segmentation processes were compared using the Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) and the Hausdorff Distance (HD) which yielded to a DSC of 82.99+/-5.03% and a HD of 18.91+/-7.2 voxel, respectively. In addition, the times have been measured during the manual and the GrowCut segmentations, showing that a GrowCut-segmentation - with an average time of less than six minutes (5.77+/-0.73) - is significantly shorter than a pure manual outlining.

由于人口老龄化，当今脊柱疾病越来越普遍，例如，白种女性的骨质疏松性骨折终生风险为40％，美国白人为13％。因此，随着人口老龄化，手术脊柱手术的数量也在增加，精确的诊断对于减少症状的并发症和复发起着至关重要的作用。脊柱的脊柱成像是一个繁琐的过程，受到解释错误的影响。本文旨在通过应用和研究GrowCut算法对椎体与周围结构的边界分割，减少椎体解释的时间和误差。 GrowCut是一个使用元胞自动机的竞争性区域增长算法。对于我们的研究，椎体T2加权磁共振成像（MRI）扫描首先由神经外科医生手动勾画出来。然后，由GrowCut训练的医生使用半自动GrowCut算法在医学图像中分割椎体。之后，分别使用Dice相似系数（DSC）和Hausdorff距离（HD）对两个分割过程的结果进行比较，其产生至82.99 +/- 5.03％的DSC和18.91 +/- 7.2体素的HD。此外，在手册和GrowCut分割期间测量了时间，显示GrowCut分割 - 平均时间小于6分钟（5.77 +/- 0.73） - 明显短于纯手动轮廓。
