##### Abstract
Recently, machine learning has prevailed in many academia and industrial applications. At the same time, quantum computing, once seen as not realizable, has been brought to markets by several tech giants. However, these machines are not fault-tolerant and can not execute very deep circuits. Therefore, it is urgent to design suitable algorithms and applications implementable on these machines. In this work, we demonstrate a novel approach which applies variational quantum circuits to deep reinforcement learning. With the proposed method, we can implement famous deep reinforcement learning algorithms such as experience replay and target network with variational quantum circuits. In this framework, with appropriate information encoding scheme, the possible quantum advantage is the number of circuit parameters with $poly(\log{} N)$ compared to $poly(N)$ in conventional neural network where $N$ is the dimension of input vectors. Such an approach can be deployed on near-term noisy intermediate-scale quantum machines.
