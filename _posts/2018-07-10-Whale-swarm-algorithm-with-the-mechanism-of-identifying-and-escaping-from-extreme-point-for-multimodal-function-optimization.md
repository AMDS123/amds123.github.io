##### Abstract
Most real-world optimization problems often come with multiple global optima or local optima. Therefore, increasing niching metaheuristic algorithms, which devote to finding multiple optima in a single run, are developed to solve these multimodal optimization problems. However, there are two difficulties urgently to be solved for most existing niching metaheuristic algorithms: how to set the optimal values of niching parameters for different optimization problems, and how to jump out of the local optima efficiently. These two difficulties limited their practicality largely. Based on Whale Swarm Algorithm (WSA) we proposed previously, this paper presents a new multimodal optimizer named WSA with Iterative Counter (WSA-IC) to address these two difficulties. In the one hand, WSA-IC improves the iteration rule of the original WSA for multimodal optimization, which removes the need of specifying different values of attenuation coefficient for different problems to form multiple subpopulations, without introducing any niching parameter. In the other hand, WSA-IC enables the identification of extreme point during iterations relying on two new parameters (i.e., stability threshold Ts and fitness threshold Tf), to jump out of the located extreme point. Moreover, the convergence of WSA-IC is proved. Finally, the proposed WSA-IC is compared with several niching metaheuristic algorithms on CEC2015 niching benchmark test functions and five additional classical multimodal functions with high dimensions. The experimental results demonstrate that WSA-IC statistically outperforms other niching metaheuristic algorithms on most test functions.

大多数现实世界的优化问题通常伴随着多个全局最优或局部最优。因此，为了解决这些多模态优化问题，开发了用于在单次运行中寻找多个最优的niching元启发式算法。然而，大多数现有的小生境启发式算法迫切需要解决两个难点：如何针对不同的优化问题设置小生境参数的最优值，以及如何有效地跳出局部最优值。这两个困难主要限制了它们的实用性。基于我们之前提出的鲸鱼群算法（WSA），本文提出了一种新的多模态优化器WSA，它具有迭代计数器（WSA-IC）来解决这两个难题。一方面，WSA-IC改进了原始WSA的迭代规则，用于多模态优化，这消除了为不同问题指定不同衰减系数值以形成多个子群体的需要，而不引入任何小生境参数。另一方面，WSA-IC使得能够在依赖于两个新参数（即，稳定性阈值Ts和适应度阈值Tf）的迭代期间识别极值点，以跳出定位的极值点。此外，证明了WSA-IC的融合。最后，将所提出的WSA-IC与CEC2015小型基准测试函数和五个额外的高维多维模型函数的几种小型元启发式算法进行了比较。实验结果表明，WSA-IC在大多数测试函数上的统计上优于其他niching元启发式算法。
