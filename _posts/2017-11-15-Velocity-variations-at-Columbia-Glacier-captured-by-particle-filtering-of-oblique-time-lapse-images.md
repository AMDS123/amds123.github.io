##### Abstract
We develop a probabilistic method for tracking glacier surface motion based on time-lapse imagery, which works by sequentially resampling a stochastic state-space model according to a likelihood determined through correlation between reference and test images. The method is robust due to its natural handling of periodic occlusion and its capacity to follow multiple hypothesis displacements between images, and can improve estimates of velocity magnitude and direction through the inclusion of observations from an arbitrary number of cameras. We apply the method to an annual record of images from two cameras near the terminus of Columbia Glacier. While the method produces velocities at daily resolution, we verify our results by comparing eleven-day means to TerraSar-X. We find that Columbia Glacier transitions between a winter state characterized by moderate velocities and little temporal variability, to an early summer speed-up in which velocities are sensitive to increases in melt- and rainwater, to a fall slowdown, where velocities drop to below their winter mean and become insensitive to external forcing, a pattern consistent with the development and collapse of efficient and inefficient subglacial hydrologic networks throughout the year.

我们开发了一种基于时间推移图像跟踪冰川表面运动的概率方法，该方法通过根据通过参考图像和测试图像之间的相关确定的可能性对随机状态空间模型进行顺序重新采样来工作。该方法由于自然处理周期性遮挡以及能够遵循图像之间的多个假设位移而具有鲁棒性，并且可以通过包含来自任意数量的摄像机的观测来改善对速度大小和方向的估计。我们将该方法应用于哥伦比亚冰川终点附近的两台摄像机的年度记录。虽然该方法在日常分辨率下产生速度，但我们通过比较TerraSar-X的十一天手段来验证我们的结果。我们发现哥伦比亚冰川在一个以中等速度和很小的时间变化为特征的冬季状态之间转换，初夏的速度对融化水和雨水的增加速度敏感，到速度下降到速度下降的下降速度冬季意味着对外界的强迫不敏感，这种模式与全年高效低效的冰下水文网络的发展和崩溃是一致的。
