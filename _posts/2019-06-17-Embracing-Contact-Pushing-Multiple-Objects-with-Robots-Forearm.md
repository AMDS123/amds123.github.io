##### Abstract
Grasping is the dominant approach for robot manipulation, but only a single object can be grasped at a time. Nonprehensile manipulation offers richer set of interactions, however state-of-the-art is limited to using the end-effector only. We propose using a robot link (forearm) to push multiple objects at once. In a simulated task where the robot's task is to sort two kinds of objects into their respective goal regions, we show that a greedy strategy that uses a combination of forearm pushes and pick and place operations reduces task completion time by %28 compared to picking and placing each object individually.
