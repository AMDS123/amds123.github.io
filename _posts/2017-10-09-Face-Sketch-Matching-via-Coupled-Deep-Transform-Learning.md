##### Abstract
Face sketch to digital image matching is an important challenge of face recognition that involves matching across different domains. Current research efforts have primarily focused on extracting domain invariant representations or learning a mapping from one domain to the other. In this research, we propose a novel transform learning based approach termed as DeepTransformer, which learns a transformation and mapping function between the features of two domains. The proposed formulation is independent of the input information and can be applied with any existing learned or hand-crafted feature. Since the mapping function is directional in nature, we propose two variants of DeepTransformer: (i) semi-coupled and (ii) symmetrically-coupled deep transform learning. This research also uses a novel IIIT-D Composite Sketch with Age (CSA) variations database which contains sketch images of 150 subjects along with age-separated digital photos. The performance of the proposed models is evaluated on a novel application of sketch-to-sketch matching, along with sketch-to-digital photo matching. Experimental results demonstrate the robustness of the proposed models in comparison to existing state-of-the-art sketch matching algorithms and a commercial face recognition system.

面对素描到数字图像匹配是涉及跨不同领域的匹配的面部识别的重要挑战。目前的研究工作主要集中在提取域不变表示或学习从一个域到另一个域的映射。在这项研究中，我们提出了一种新的基于变换学习的方法，称为DeepTransformer，它学习了两个领域特征之间的变换和映射函数。所提出的配方独立于输入信息，可以与任何现有的学习或手工特征一起使用。由于映射函数本质上是方向性的，因此我们提出两种DeepTransformer变体：（i）半耦合和（ii）对称耦合深变换学习。这项研究还使用了一个新颖的IIIT-D复合素描随年龄（CSA）变化数据库，其中包含150个科目的素描图像以及年龄分隔的数码照片。所提出的模型的性能通过草图 - 草图匹配的新颖应用以及草图 - 数字照片匹配来评估。实验结果证明了所提出的模型与现有技术的草图匹配算法和商业人脸识别系统的鲁棒性。
