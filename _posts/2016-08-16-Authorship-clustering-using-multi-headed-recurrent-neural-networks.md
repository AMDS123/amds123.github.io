##### Abstract
A recurrent neural network that has been trained to separately model the language of several documents by unknown authors is used to measure similarity between the documents. It is able to find clues of common authorship even when the documents are very short and about disparate topics. While it is easy to make statistically significant predictions regarding authorship, it is difficult to group documents into definite clusters with high accuracy.

##### Abstract (translated by Google)
一个经过训练的循环神经网络可以分别模拟未知作者的几个文档的语言，用来衡量文档之间的相似度。即使文件非常短，关于不同的话题，它也能找到共同作者的线索。虽然很容易对作者身份进行有统计学意义的预测，但很难高精度地将文档分组为明确的簇。
