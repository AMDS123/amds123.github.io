##### Abstract
Peer-to-peer (P2P) Data-sharing systems now generate a significant portion of internet traffic. P2P systems have emerged as a popular way to share huge volumes of data. Requirements for widely distributed information systems supporting virtual organizations have given rise to a new category of P2P systems called schema- based. In such systems each peer is a database management system in itself, ex-posing its own schema. A fundamental problem that confronts peer-to-peer applications is the efficient location of the node that stores a desired data item. In such settings, the main objective is the efficient search across peer databases by processing each incoming query without overly consuming bandwidth. The usability of these systems depends on effective techniques to find and retrieve data; however, efficient and effective routing of content- based queries is an emerging problem in P2P networks. In this paper, we propose an architecture, based on super-peers, and we focus on query routing. Our approach considers that super-Peers having similar interests are grouped together for an efficient query routing method. In such groups, called Knowledge-Super-Peers (KSP), super-peers submit queries that are often processed by members of this group.
