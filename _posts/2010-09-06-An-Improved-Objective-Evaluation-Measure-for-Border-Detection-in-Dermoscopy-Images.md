##### Abstract
Background: Dermoscopy is one of the major imaging modalities used in the diagnosis of melanoma and other pigmented skin lesions. Due to the difficulty and subjectivity of human interpretation, dermoscopy image analysis has become an important research area. One of the most important steps in dermoscopy image analysis is the automated detection of lesion borders. Although numerous methods have been developed for the detection of lesion borders, very few studies were comprehensive in the evaluation of their results. Methods: In this paper, we evaluate five recent border detection methods on a set of 90 dermoscopy images using three sets of dermatologist-drawn borders as the ground-truth. In contrast to previous work, we utilize an objective measure, the Normalized Probabilistic Rand Index, which takes into account the variations in the ground-truth images. Conclusion: The results demonstrate that the differences between four of the evaluated border detection methods are in fact smaller than those predicted by the commonly used XOR measure.

背景：皮肤镜检查是诊断黑色素瘤和其他色素性皮肤病变的主要成像手段之一。由于人类解读的困难和主观性，皮肤镜图像分析已成为重要的研究领域。皮肤镜图像分析中最重要的步骤之一是自动检测病变边界。尽管已经开发了许多方法来检测病变边界，但是对其结果的评估却很少有全面的研究。方法：在本文中，我们使用三组皮肤科医生绘制的边界作为基础事实，评估了最近的一组90幅皮肤镜检图像中的五个边界检测方法。与以前的工作相反，我们利用了一个客观的测量，归一化概率兰德指数，它考虑了地面实况图像的变化。结论：结果表明，四种评估的边界检测方法之间的差异实际上小于通常使用的异或度量所预测的差异。
