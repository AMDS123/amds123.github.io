##### Abstract
Working memory is a cognitive process that is responsible for temporarily holding and manipulating information. Most of the empirical neuroscience research on working memory has focused on measuring sustained activity in prefrontal cortex (PFC) and/or parietal cortex during simple delayed-response tasks, and most of the models of working memory have been based on neural integrators. But working memory means much more than just holding a piece of information online. We describe a new theory of working memory, based on a recurrent neural circuit that we call ORGaNICs (Oscillatory Recurrent GAted Neural Integrator Circuits). ORGaNICs are a variety of Long Short Term Memory units (LSTMs), imported from machine learning and artificial intelligence. ORGaNICs can be used to explain the complex dynamics of delay-period activity in prefrontal cortex (PFC) during a working memory task. The theory is analytically tractable so that we can characterize the dynamics, and the theory provides a means for reading out information from the dynamically varying responses at any point in time, in spite of the complex dynamics. ORGaNICs can be implemented with a biophysical (electrical circuit) model of pyramidal cells, combined with shunting inhibition via a thalamocortical loop. Although introduced as a computational theory of working memory, ORGaNICs are also applicable to models of sensory processing, motor preparation and motor control. ORGaNICs offer computational advantages compared to other varieties of LSTMs that are commonly used in AI applications. Consequently, ORGaNICs are a framework for canonical computation in brains and machines.

工作记忆是一个认知过程，负责暂时持有和操纵信息。大多数关于工作记忆的经验神经科学研究集中于测量简单延迟响应任务期间的前额叶皮层（PFC）和/或顶叶皮层的持续活动，并且大多数工作记忆模型基于神经集成器。但工作记忆不仅仅意味着在线保存一条信息。我们描述了一种新的工作记忆理论，它基于一种我们称之为ORGaNICs（振荡递归神经积分电路）的循环神经电路。 ORGaNIC是由机器学习和人工智能导入的各种长期短期记忆单元（LSTM）。 ORGaNIC可用于解释工作记忆任务期间前额叶皮层（PFC）延迟期活动的复杂动力学。该理论是分析上易于处理的，因此我们可以表征动力学，并且该理论提供了一种手段，用于在任何时间点从动态变化的响应中读出信息，尽管动力学复杂。 ORGaNICs可以用锥体细胞的生物物理学（电路）模型实现，与通过丘脑皮质环的分流抑制相结合。虽然作为工作记忆的计算理论引入，但ORGaNIC也适用于感觉处理，电机准备和电机控制模型。与AI应用中常用的其他各种LSTM相比，ORGaNIC具有计算优势。因此，ORGaNIC是大脑和机器中规范计算的框架。
