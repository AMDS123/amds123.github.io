##### Abstract
In classifier (or regression) fusion the aim is to combine the outputs of several algorithms to boost overall performance. Standard supervised fusion algorithms often require accurate and precise training labels. However, accurate labels may be difficult to obtain in many remote sensing applications. This paper proposes novel classification and regression fusion models that can be trained given ambiguosly and imprecisely labeled training data in which training labels are associated with sets of data points (i.e., "bags") instead of individual data points (i.e., "instances") following a multiple instance learning framework. Experiments were conducted based on the proposed algorithms on both synthetic data and applications such as target detection and crop yield prediction given remote sensing data. The proposed algorithms show effective classification and regression performance.

在分类器（或回归）融合中，目标是结合几种算法的输出来提高整体性能。标准的监督融合算法通常需要准确和精确的训练标签。然而，在许多遥感应用中，准确的标签可能很难获得。本文提出了新的分类和回归融合模型，可以在给定模糊和不精确标记的训练数据的情况下对训练数据进行训练，其中训练标签与数据点集（即“袋”）而不是单个数据点（即“实例”）相关联遵循多实例学习框架。基于所提出的合成数据和应用的算法进行了实验，例如给出遥感数据的目标检测和作物产量预测。所提出的算法显示出有效的分类和回归性能。
