##### Abstract
Swarm robotic systems are systems in which multiple robots having simple functionality perform tasks through their cooperation, and are advantageous in that they can exhibit non-trivial macroscopic functions such as adaptability, fault tolerance, and scalability. We previously proposed a simple model of swarm formation inspired by friendship formation process in human society, and demonstrated via simulation that various non-trivial patterns emerge. In this study, we examine the applicability of the proposed model to a swarm robotic system. As a first step, we developed five robots and demonstrated via real-world experiments that the simulation results can be largely reproduced.

群体机器人系统是其中具有简单功能的多个机器人通过它们的协作执行任务的系统，并且其优点在于它们可以表现出非平凡的宏观功能，例如适应性，容错性和可扩展性。我们之前提出了一个简单的群体形成模型，其灵感来自人类社会中的友谊形成过程，并通过模拟证明了各种非平凡模式的出现。在本研究中，我们研究了所提出的模型在群体机器人系统中的适用性。作为第一步，我们开发了五个机器人，并通过实际实验证明模拟结果可以在很大程度上再现。
