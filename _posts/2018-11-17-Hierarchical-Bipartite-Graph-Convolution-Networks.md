##### Abstract
Recently, graph neural networks have been adopted in a wide variety of applications ranging from relational representations to modeling irregular data domains such as point clouds and social graphs. However, the space of graph neural network architectures remains highly fragmented impeding the development of optimized implementations similar to what is available for convolutional neural networks. In this work, we present BiGraphNet, a general architecture that can be adapted to a class of popular graph neural networks. By explicitly specifying the input and output nodes, BiGraphNet: (i) generalizes the graph convolution to support multiple input graphs (skips) and graph expansions (unpooling) which can be used for multiple graph aggregations, graph autoencoders, and graph residual nets; and (ii) accelerates and scales the computations and memory requirements in hierarchical networks by performing computations only at specified output nodes.
