##### Abstract
We consider the task of image decomposition and we introduce a new model coined directional global three-part decomposition (DG3PD) for solving it. As key ingredients of the DG3PD model, we introduce a discrete multi-directional total variation norm and a discrete multi-directional G-norm. Using these novel norms, the proposed discrete DG3PD model can decompose an image into two parts or into three parts. Existing models for image decomposition by Vese and Osher, by Aujol and Chambolle, by Starck et al., and by Thai and Gottschlich are included as special cases in the new model. Decomposition of an image by DG3PD results in a cartoon image, a texture image and a residual image. Advantages of the DG3PD model over existing ones lie in the properties enforced on the cartoon and texture images. The geometric objects in the cartoon image have a very smooth surface and sharp edges. The texture image yields oscillating patterns on a defined scale which is both smooth and sparse. Moreover, the DG3PD method achieves the goal of perfect reconstruction by summation of all components better than the other considered methods. Relevant applications of DG3PD are a novel way of image compression as well as feature extraction for applications such as latent fingerprint processing and optical character recognition.

我们考虑图像分解的任务，并且我们引入了一个新的模型创造方向全局三部分分解（DG3PD）来解决它。作为DG3PD模型的关键组成部分，我们引入了一个离散的多方向总变差范数和一个离散的多方向G范数。使用这些新的规范，所提出的离散DG3PD模型可以将图像分解成两部分或三部分。现有的Vese和Osher的图像分解模型，由Starck等人的Aujol和Chambolle，以及Thai和Gottschlich的图像分解被包括在新模型中作为特例。通过DG3PD分解图像导致卡通图像，纹理图像和残差图像。 DG3PD模型与现有模型的优势在于卡通和纹理图像的属性。卡通形象中的几何物体表面非常光滑，边缘锐利。纹理图像以规定的比例产生振荡模式，该模式既平滑又稀疏。此外，DG3PD方法比其他方法更好地实现了所有成分求和的完美重构目标。 DG3PD的相关应用是图像压缩以及潜在指纹处理和光学字符识别等应用的一种新颖的方法。
