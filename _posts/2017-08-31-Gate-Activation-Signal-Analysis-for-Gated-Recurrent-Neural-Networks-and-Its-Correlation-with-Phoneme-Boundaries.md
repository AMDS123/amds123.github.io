##### Abstract
In this paper we analyze the gate activation signals inside the gated recurrent neural networks, and find the temporal structure of such signals is highly correlated with the phoneme boundaries. This correlation is further verified by a set of experiments for phoneme segmentation, in which better results compared to standard approaches were obtained.

##### Abstract (translated by Google)
本文分析了门控回归神经网络中的门激活信号，发现这些信号的时间结构与音素边界高度相关。这种相关性进一步通过音素分割的一组实验来验证，其中与标准方法相比获得了更好的结果。
