##### Abstract
With the advent of GDPR, the domain of explainable AI and model interpretability has gained added impetus. Methods to extract and communicate visibility into decision-making models have become legal requirement. Two specific types of explanations, contrastive and counterfactual have been identified as suitable for human understanding. In this paper, we propose a model agnostic method and its systemic implementation to generate these explanations using shapely additive explanations (SHAP). We discuss a generative pipeline to create contrastive explanations and use it to further to generate counterfactual datapoints. This pipeline is tested and discussed on the IRIS, Wine Quality &amp; Mobile Features dataset. Analysis of the results obtained follows.
