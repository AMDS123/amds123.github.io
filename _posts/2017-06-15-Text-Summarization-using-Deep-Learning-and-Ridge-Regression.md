##### Abstract
We develop models and extract relevant features for automatic text summarization and investigate the performance of different models on the DUC 2001 dataset. Two different models were developed, one being a ridge regressor and the other one was a multi-layer perceptron. The hyperparameters were varied and their performance were noted. We segregated the summarization task into 2 main steps, the first being sentence ranking and the second step being sentence selection. In the first step, given a document, we sort the sentences based on their Importance, and in the second step, in order to obtain non-redundant sentences, we weed out the sentences that are have high similarity with the previously selected sentences.

我们开发模型并提取自动文本摘要的相关特征，并调查DUC 2001数据集上不同模型的性能。开发了两种不同的模型，一种是脊线回归器，另一种是多层感知器。超参数是变化的，他们的表现被注意到。我们将摘要任务分为两个主要步骤，第一个是句子排序，第二个是句子选择。在第一步中，给定一个文档，我们根据它们的重要性对这些句子进行排序，然后在第二步中，为了获得非冗余句子，我们去掉与之前选择的句子具有高度相似性的句子。
