##### Abstract
Aerial videos taken by a drone not too far above the surface may contain the drone's shadow projected on the scene. This deteriorates the aesthetic quality of videos. With the presence of other shadows, shadow removal cannot be directly applied, and the shadow of the drone must be tracked. Tracking a drone's shadow in a video is, however, challenging. The varying size, shape, change of orientation and drone altitude pose difficulties. The shadow can also easily disappear over dark areas. However, a shadow has specific properties that can be leveraged, besides its geometric shape. In this paper, we incorporate knowledge of the shadow's physical properties, in the form of shadow detection masks, into a correlation-based tracking algorithm. We capture a test set of aerial videos taken with different settings and compare our results to those of a state-of-the-art tracking algorithm.
