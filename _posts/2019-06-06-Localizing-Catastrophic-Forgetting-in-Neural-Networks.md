##### Abstract
Artificial neural networks (ANNs) suffer from catastrophic forgetting when trained on a sequence of tasks. While this phenomenon was studied in the past, there is only very limited recent research on this phenomenon. We propose a method for determining the contribution of individual parameters in an ANN to catastrophic forgetting. The method is used to analyze an ANNs response to three different continual learning scenarios.
