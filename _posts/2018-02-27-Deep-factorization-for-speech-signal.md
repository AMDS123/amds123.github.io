##### Abstract
Various informative factors mixed in speech signals, leading to great difficulty when decoding any of the factors. An intuitive idea is to factorize each speech frame into individual informative factors, though it turns out to be highly difficult. Recently, we found that speaker traits, which were assumed to be long-term distributional properties, are actually short-time patterns, and can be learned by a carefully designed deep neural network (DNN). This discovery motivated a cascade deep factorization (CDF) framework that will be presented in this paper. The proposed framework infers speech factors in a sequential way, where factors previously inferred are used as conditional variables when inferring other factors. We will show that this approach can effectively factorize speech signals, and using these factors, the original speech spectrum can be recovered with a high accuracy. This factorization and reconstruction approach provides potential values for many speech processing tasks, e.g., speaker recognition and emotion recognition, as will be demonstrated in the paper.

在语音信号中混入各种信息因素，这在解码任何因素时导致很大困难。一个直观的想法是将每个语音帧分解成单独的信息因素，尽管它变得非常困难。最近，我们发现被假定为长期分布属性的说话者特征实际上是短时模式，并且可以通过仔细设计的深度神经网络（DNN）来学习。这一发现激发了本文将介绍的级联深层分解（CDF）框架。所提出的框架以连续方式推断语音因素，在推断其他因素时，先前推断的因素被用作条件变量。我们将展示这种方法可以有效地分解语音信号，并且使用这些因素，可以高精度地恢复原始语音频谱。这种分解和重构方法为许多语音处理任务提供了潜在的价值，例如说话者识别和情感识别，这将在论文中展示。
