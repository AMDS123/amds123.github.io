##### Abstract
Reconstructing 3D shapes from single-view images has been a long-standing research problem and has attracted a lot of attention. In this paper, we present DISN, a Deep Implicit Surface Network that generates a high-quality 3D shape given an input image by predicting the underlying signed distance field. In addition to utilizing global image features, DISN also predicts the local image patch each 3D point sample projects onto and extracts local features from the patch. Combining global and local features significantly improves the accuracy of the predicted signed distance field. To the best of our knowledge, DISN is the first method that constantly captures details such as holes and thin structures present in 3D shapes from single-view images. DISN achieves state-of-the-art single-view reconstruction performance on a variety of shape categories reconstructed from both synthetic and real images. Code is available at github.com/laughtervv/DISN.
