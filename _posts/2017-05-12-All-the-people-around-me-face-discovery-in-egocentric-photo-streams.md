##### Abstract
Given an unconstrained stream of images captured by a wearable photo-camera (2fpm), we propose an unsupervised bottom-up approach for automatic clustering appearing faces into the individual identities present in these data. The problem is challenging since images are acquired under real world conditions; hence the visible appearance of the people in the images undergoes intensive variations. Our proposed pipeline consists of first arranging the photo-stream into events, later, localizing the appearance of multiple people in them, and finally, grouping various appearances of the same person across different events. Experimental results performed on a dataset acquired by wearing a photo-camera during one month, demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach for the considered purpose.

##### Abstract (translated by Google)
由于可穿戴照相机（2fpm）捕获的图像流不受约束，我们提出了一种无监督的自下而上的方法，用于将出现的人脸自动聚类成这些数据中存在的个人身份。这个问题是具有挑战性的，因为图像是在现实世界中获得的因此图像中的人物的可见外观经历了大量的变化。我们提出的流程包括首先将照片流安排到事件中，之后将其中多个人的外观本地化，最后将同一个人的各种外观分组在不同的事件中。对在一个月内佩戴照相机所获得的数据集进行的实验结果证明了所提出的方法对于所考虑目的的有效性。
