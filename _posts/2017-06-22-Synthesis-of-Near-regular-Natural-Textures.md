##### Abstract
Texture synthesis is widely used in the field of computer graphics, vision, and image processing. In the present paper, a texture synthesis algorithm is proposed for near-regular natural textures with the help of a representative periodic pattern extracted from the input textures using distance matching function. Local texture statistics is then analyzed against global texture statistics for non-overlapping windows of size same as periodic pattern size and a representative periodic pattern is extracted from the image and used for texture synthesis, while preserving the global regularity and visual appearance. Validation of the algorithm based on experiments with synthetic textures whose periodic pattern sizes are known and containing camouflages / defects proves the strength of the algorithm for texture synthesis and its application in detection of camouflages / defects in textures.

纹理合成被广泛用于计算机图形学，视觉和图像处理领域。在本文中，利用距离匹配函数从输入纹理中提取代表性的周期性模式，提出了一种近似规则的自然纹理纹理合成算法。然后针对大小与周期性图案大小相同的非重叠窗口的全局纹理统计来分析局部纹理统计，并从图像中提取代表性的周期性图案并用于纹理合成，同时保持全局规律性和视觉外观。基于周期性图案尺寸已知且包含伪装/缺陷的合成纹理的实验的算法验证证明了纹理合成算法的强度及其在纹理伪装/缺陷检测中的应用。
