##### Abstract
In this paper, a concept of multipurpose object detection system, recently introduced in our previous work, is clarified. The business aspect of this method is transformation of a classifier into an object detector/locator via an image grid. This is a universal framework for locating objects of interest through classification. The framework standardizes and simplifies implementation of custom systems by doing only a custom analysis of the classification results on the image grid.

在本文中，澄清了最近在我们以前的工作中介绍的多用途物体检测系统的概念。该方法的业务方面是通过图像网格将分类器转换为对象检测器/定位器。这是通过分类来定位感兴趣对象的通用框架。该框架通过对图像网格上的分类结果进行自定义分析来标准化和简化自定义系统的实现。
