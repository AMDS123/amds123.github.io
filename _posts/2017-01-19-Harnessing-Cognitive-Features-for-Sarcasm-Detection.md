##### Abstract
In this paper, we propose a novel mechanism for enriching the feature vector, for the task of sarcasm detection, with cognitive features extracted from eye-movement patterns of human readers. Sarcasm detection has been a challenging research problem, and its importance for NLP applications such as review summarization, dialog systems and sentiment analysis is well recognized. Sarcasm can often be traced to incongruity that becomes apparent as the full sentence unfolds. This presence of incongruity- implicit or explicit- affects the way readers eyes move through the text. We observe the difference in the behaviour of the eye, while reading sarcastic and non sarcastic sentences. Motivated by his observation, we augment traditional linguistic and stylistic features for sarcasm detection with the cognitive features obtained from readers eye movement data. We perform statistical classification using the enhanced feature set so obtained. The augmented cognitive features improve sarcasm detection by 3.7% (in terms of F-score), over the performance of the best reported system.

在本文中，我们提出了一种丰富特征向量的新机制，用于讽刺检测任务，从人类阅读者的眼动模式中提取认知特征。讽刺检测一直是一个具有挑战性的研究问题，其对于NLP应用（例如评论摘要，对话系统和情感分析）的重要性已得到公认。讽刺往往可以追溯到整个句子展开时变得明显的不协调。这种不协调的存在 - 隐含或显式 - 影响读者在文本中移动的方式。我们观察眼睛的行为差异，同时阅读讽刺和非讽刺的句子。受其观察的启发，我们用阅读者眼动数据获得的认知特征增强了讽刺检测的传统语言和文体特征。我们使用这样获得的增强特征集进行统计分类。增强的认知特征使讽刺检测提高了3.7％（就F评分而言），优于最佳报告系统的性能。
