##### Abstract
Detection of surface water in natural environment via multi-spectral imagery has been widely utilized in many fields, such land cover identification. However, due to the similarity of the spectra of water bodies, built-up areas, approaches based on high-resolution satellites sometimes confuse these features. A popular direction to detect water is spectral index, often requiring the ground truth to find appropriate thresholds manually. As for traditional machine learning methods, they identify water merely via differences of spectra of various land covers, without taking specific properties of spectral reflection into account. In this paper, we propose an automatic approach to detect water bodies based on Dempster-Shafer theory, combining supervised learning with specific property of water in spectral band in a fully unsupervised context. The benefits of our approach are twofold. On the one hand, it performs well in mapping principle water bodies, including little streams and branches. On the other hand, it labels all objects usually confused with water as `ignorance', including half-dry watery areas, built-up areas and semi-transparent clouds and shadows. `Ignorance' indicates not only limitations of the spectral properties of water and supervised learning itself but insufficiency of information from multi-spectral bands as well, providing valuable information for further land cover classification.

通过多光谱成像技术检测自然环境中的地表水，已被广泛应用于土地覆盖物识别等领域。但是，由于水体光谱的相似性，建筑物区域，基于高分辨率卫星的方法有时会混淆这些特征。检测水的流行方向是光谱指数，通常需要基础事实来手动找到适当的阈值。对于传统的机器学习方法，仅仅是通过各种土地覆盖的光谱差异来识别水分，而不考虑光谱反射的具体特性。在本文中，我们提出了一种基于DS证据理论的水体自动检测方法，在完全无监督的情况下，将监督学习与水域的特定属性相结合。我们的方法的好处是双重的。一方面，它在水体的映射原理方面表现良好，包括小流和分支。另一方面，它把所有与水相混淆的物体都标记为“无知”，包括半干燥的水域，建成区和半透明的云和阴影。 “无知”不仅表明了水的光谱特性和监督学习本身的局限性，也表明了多光谱波段信息的不足，为进一步的土地覆盖分类提供了有价值的信息。
