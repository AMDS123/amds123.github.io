##### Abstract
In this paper, we study the problem of hyperspectral pixel classification based on the recently proposed architectures for compressive whisk-broom hyperspectral imagers without the need to reconstruct the complete data cube. A clear advantage of classification in the compressed domain is its suitability for real-time on-site processing of the sensed data. Moreover, it is assumed that the training process also takes place in the compressed domain, thus, isolating the classification unit from the recovery unit at the receiver's side. We show that, perhaps surprisingly, using distinct measurement matrices for different pixels results in more accuracy of the learned classifier and consistent classification performance, supporting the role of information diversity in learning.

在本文中，我们研究了基于最近提出的压缩扫帚高光谱成像器架构的高光谱像素分类问题，而不需要重建完整的数据立方体。分类在压缩域中的明显优势在于它适合于对感测数据进行实时现场处理。此外，假定训练过程也发生在压缩域中，从而将分类单元与接收方的恢复单元隔离。我们表明，也许令人惊讶的是，对不同的像素使用不同的测量矩阵会导致学习分类器的更加准确和一致的分类性能，从而支持信息多样性在学习中的作用。
