##### Abstract
In this work, a pattern recognition system is investigated for blind automatic classification of digitally modulated communication signals. The proposed technique is able to discriminate the type of modulation scheme which is eventually used for demodulation followed by information extraction. The proposed system is composed of two subsystems namely feature extraction sub-system (FESS) and classifier sub-system (CSS). The FESS consists of continuous wavelet transform (CWT) for feature generation and principal component analysis (PCA) for selection of the feature subset which is rich in discriminatory information. The CSS uses the selected features to accurately classify the modulation class of the received signal. The proposed technique uses probabilistic neural network (PNN) and multilayer perceptron forward neural network (MLPFN) for comparative study of their recognition ability. PNN have been found to perform better in terms of classification accuracy as well as testing and training time than MLPFN. The proposed approach is robust to presence of phase offset and additive Gaussian noise.

在这项工作中，一个模式识别系统被调查的数字调制通信信号盲自动分类。所提出的技术能够区分最终用于解调的调制方案的类型，随后是信息提取。所提出的系统由两个子系统组成，即特征提取子系统（FESS）和分类器子系统（CSS）。 FESS由特征生成的连续小波变换（CWT）和主成分分析（PCA）组成，用于选择具有丰富差别信息的特征子集。 CSS使用选择的特征来精确分类接收信号的调制类别。该方法利用概率神经网络（PNN）和多层感知器前向神经网络（MLPFN）对其识别能力进行比较研究。已经发现PNN在分类准确性以及测试和训练时间上比MLPFN表现更好。所提出的方法对相位偏移和加性高斯噪声的存在是鲁棒的。
