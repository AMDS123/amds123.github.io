##### Abstract
A good dialogue agent should have the ability to interact with users by both responding to questions and by asking questions, and importantly to learn from both types of interaction. In this work, we explore this direction by designing a simulator and a set of synthetic tasks in the movie domain that allow such interactions between a learner and a teacher. We investigate how a learner can benefit from asking questions in both offline and online reinforcement learning settings, and demonstrate that the learner improves when asking questions. Finally, real experiments with Mechanical Turk validate the approach. Our work represents a first step in developing such end-to-end learned interactive dialogue agents.

一个好的对话代理应该能够通过回答问题和提问来与用户交互，重要的是从两种交互中学习。在这项工作中，我们通过在电影领域设计一个模拟器和一系列综合任务来探索这个方向，使得学习者和教师之间可以进行这样的交互。我们调查了学习者如何通过在线下和在线强化学习环境中提问来获益，并证明学习者在提问时能够提高。最后，通过Mechanical Turk的真实实验验证了方法。我们的工作是开发这种端到端的学习互动对话代理的第一步。
