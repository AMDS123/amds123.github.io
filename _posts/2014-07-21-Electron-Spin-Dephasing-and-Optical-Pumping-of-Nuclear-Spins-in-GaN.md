##### Abstract
We have measured the donor-bound electron spin dynamics in cubic GaN by time-resolved Kerr rotation experiments. The ensemble electron spin dephasing time in this quantum dot like system characterized by a Bohr radius of 2.5 nm is of the order of 1.5 ns as a result of the interaction with the fluctuating nuclear spins. It increases drastically when an external magnetic field as small as 10 mT is applied. We extract a dispersion of the nuclear hyperfine field {\delta}Bn $\sim$ 4 mT, in agreement with calculations. We also demonstrate for the first time in GaN based systems the optical pumping of nuclear spin yielding the build-up of a significant nuclear polarization.
