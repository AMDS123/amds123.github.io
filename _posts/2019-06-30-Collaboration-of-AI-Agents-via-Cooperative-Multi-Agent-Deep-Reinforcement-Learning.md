##### Abstract
There are many AI tasks involving multiple interacting agents where agents should learn to cooperate and collaborate to effectively perform the task. Here we develop and evaluate various multi-agent protocols to train agents to collaborate with teammates in grid soccer. We train and evaluate our multi-agent methods against a team operating with a smart hand-coded policy. As a baseline, we train agents concurrently and independently, with no communication. Our collaborative protocols were parameter sharing, coordinated learning with communication, and counterfactual policy gradients. Against the hand-coded team, the team trained with parameter sharing and the team trained with coordinated learning performed the best, scoring on 89.5% and 94.5% of episodes respectively when playing against the hand-coded team. Against the parameter sharing team, with adversarial training the coordinated learning team scored on 75% of the episodes, indicating it is the most adaptable of our methods. The insights gained from our work can be applied to other domains where multi-agent collaboration could be beneficial.
