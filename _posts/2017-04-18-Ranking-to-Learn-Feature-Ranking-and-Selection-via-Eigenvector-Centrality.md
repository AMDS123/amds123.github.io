##### Abstract
In an era where accumulating data is easy and storing it inexpensive, feature selection plays a central role in helping to reduce the high-dimensionality of huge amounts of otherwise meaningless data. In this paper, we propose a graph-based method for feature selection that ranks features by identifying the most important ones into arbitrary set of cues. Mapping the problem on an affinity graph-where features are the nodes-the solution is given by assessing the importance of nodes through some indicators of centrality, in particular, the Eigen-vector Centrality (EC). The gist of EC is to estimate the importance of a feature as a function of the importance of its neighbors. Ranking central nodes individuates candidate features, which turn out to be effective from a classification point of view, as proved by a thoroughly experimental section. Our approach has been tested on 7 diverse datasets from recent literature (e.g., biological data and object recognition, among others), and compared against filter, embedded and wrappers methods. The results are remarkable in terms of accuracy, stability and low execution time.

在数据积累容易并且存储成本低廉的时代，特征选择在帮助减少大量其他无意义数据的高维方面发挥着核心作用。在本文中，我们提出了一种基于图的特征选择方法，通过将任意一组最重要的特征识别为特征来对特征进行排序。在亲和图上映射问题 - 其中特征是节点 - 通过一些中心性指标，特别是特征向量中心性（EC）评估节点的重要性给出解决方案。 EC的要点是根据邻居的重要性来估计一个特征的重要性。对中心节点进行排序，使候选特征个别化，从分类的角度来看，这是有效的，正如一个彻底的实验部分所证明的。我们的方法已经在来自最近文献（例如，生物数据和物体识别等）的7个不同数据集上进行了测试，并且与过滤器，嵌入和包装方法进行了比较。结果在精度，稳定性和执行时间方面都非常显着。
