##### Abstract
Prison facilities, mental correctional institutions, sports bars and places of public protest are prone to sudden violence and conflicts. Surveillance systems play an important role in mitigation of hostile behavior and improvement of security by detecting such provocative and aggressive activities. This research proposed using automatic aggressive behavior and anger detection to improve the effectiveness of the surveillance systems. An emotion and aggression aware component will make the surveillance system highly responsive and capable of alerting the security guards in real time. This research proposed facial expression, head, hand and body movement and speech tracking for detecting anger and aggressive actions. Recognition was achieved using support vector machines and rule based features. The multimodal affect recognition precision rate for anger improved by 15.2% and recall rate improved by 11.7% when behavioral rule based features were used in aggressive action detection.

监狱设施，精神管理机构，体育酒吧和公众抗议场所容易出现突发暴力和冲突。监视系统通过检测这种挑衅性和侵略性活动，在缓解敌对行为和提高安全性方面发挥重要作用。本研究提出采用自动攻击行为和愤怒检测来提高监控系统的有效性。情感和侵略意识的组成部分将使监控系统高度敏感，并能够实时提醒保安人员。这项研究提出了面部表情，头部，手部和身体运动以及语音跟踪来检测愤怒和侵略行为。使用支持向量机和基于规则的特征来实现识别。基于行为规则的特征用于攻击性行为检测时，怒气多模式情感识别的精确率提高了15.2％，召回率提高了11.7％。
