##### Abstract
Machine learning (ML) algorithms have made a tremendous impact in the field of medical imaging. While medical imaging datasets have been growing in size, a challenge for supervised ML algorithms that is frequently mentioned is the lack of annotated data. As a result, various methods which can learn with less/other types of supervision, have been proposed. We review semi-supervised, multiple instance, and transfer learning in medical imaging, both in diagnosis/detection or segmentation tasks. We also discuss connections between these learning scenarios, and opportunities for future research.

机器学习（ML）算法在医学成像领域产生了巨大的影响。虽然医学成像数据集的规模在不断扩大，但经常提到的监督ML算法面临的挑战是缺乏注释数据。结果，已经提出了可以用较少/其他类型的监督学习的各种方法。我们回顾了医学成像中的半监督，多实例和转移学习，包括诊断/检测或分割任务。我们还讨论了这些学习场景与未来研究机会之间的联系。
