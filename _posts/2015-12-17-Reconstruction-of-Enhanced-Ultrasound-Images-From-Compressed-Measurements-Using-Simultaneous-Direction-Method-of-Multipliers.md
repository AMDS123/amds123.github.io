##### Abstract
High resolution ultrasound image reconstruction from a reduced number of measurements is of great interest in ultrasound imaging, since it could enhance both the frame rate and image resolution. Compressive deconvolution, combining compressed sensing and image deconvolution, represents an interesting possibility to consider this challenging task. The model of compressive deconvolution includes, in addition to the compressive sampling matrix, a 2D convolution operator carrying the information on the system point spread function. Through this model, the resolution of reconstructed ultrasound images from compressed measurements mainly depends on three aspects: the acquisition setup, i.e. the incoherence of the sampling matrix, the image regularization, i.e. the sparsity prior, and the optimization technique. In this paper, we mainly focused on the last two aspects. We proposed a novel simultaneous direction method of multipliers-based optimization scheme to invert the linear model, including two regularization terms expressing the sparsity of the RF images in a given basis and the generalized Gaussian statistical assumption on tissue reflectivity functions. The performance of the method is evaluated on both simulated and in vivo data.

高分辨率超声图像重建从减少数量的测量是非常有趣的超声成像，因为它可以提高帧速率和图像分辨率。压缩去卷积，结合压缩感知和图像去卷积，代表了一个有趣的可能性来考虑这个具有挑战性的任务。除压缩采样矩阵之外，压缩去卷积模型还包括一个二维卷积运算符，它携带有关系统点扩散函数的信息。通过这个模型，压缩测量的重建超声图像的分辨率主要取决于三个方面：采集设置，即采样矩阵的不相关性，图像正则化，即先验稀疏性和优化技术。本文主要集中在后两个方面。我们提出了一种新颖的基于乘子的优化方案的同步方向反演线性模型，包括两个正则化项表示RF图像在给定基础上的稀疏性和广义高斯统计假设对组织反射率函数的影响。该方法的性能评估模拟和体内的数据。
