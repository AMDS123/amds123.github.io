##### Abstract
Robust and accurate alignment of multimodal medical images is a very challenging task, which however is very useful for many clinical applications. For example, magnetic resonance (MR) and transrectal ultrasound (TRUS) image registration is a critical component in MR-TRUS fusion guided prostate interventions. However, due to the huge difference between the image appearances and the large variation in image correspondence, MR-TRUS image registration is a very challenging problem. In this paper, an adversarial image registration (AIR) framework is proposed. By training two deep neural networks simultaneously, one for generator and the other for discriminator, we can obtain not only an image registration network, but also a metric network which can help evaluate the quality of image registration. The developed AIR-net is then evaluated using clinical datasets acquired through image-fusion guided prostate biopsy procedures and promising results are demonstrated.

多模式医学图像的稳健和准确对齐是一项非常具有挑战性的任务，然而这对于许多临床应用来说非常有用。例如，磁共振（MR）和经直肠超声（TRUS）图像配准是MR-TRUS融合引导前列腺介入治疗中的关键部分。然而，由于图像外观与图像对应的巨大差异之间的巨大差异，MR-TRUS图像配准是一个非常具有挑战性的问题。在本文中，提出了一种敌对图像配准（AIR）框架。通过同时训练两个深度神经网络，一个用于发生器，另一个用于鉴别器，我们不仅可以获得一个图像配准网络，而且还可以获得一个度量网络，它可以帮助评估图像配准的质量。然后使用通过图像融合引导的前列腺活检程序获取的临床数据集评估开发的AIR-net，并证明有前途的结果。
