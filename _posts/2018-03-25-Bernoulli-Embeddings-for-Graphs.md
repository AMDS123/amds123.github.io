##### Abstract
Just as semantic hashing can accelerate information retrieval, binary valued embeddings can significantly reduce latency in the retrieval of graphical data. We introduce a simple but effective model for learning such binary vectors for nodes in a graph. By imagining the embeddings as independent coin flips of varying bias, continuous optimization techniques can be applied to the approximate expected loss. Embeddings optimized in this fashion consistently outperform the quantization of both spectral graph embeddings and various learned real-valued embeddings, on both ranking and pre-ranking tasks for a variety of datasets.

就像语义散列可以加速信息检索一样，二进制值嵌入可以显着减少图形数据检索的延迟。我们介绍一个简单而有效的模型，用于学习图中节点的这种二元向量。通过将嵌入想象为具有不同偏见的独立硬币翻转，可以将连续优化技术应用于近似的预期损失。对于各种数据集的排名和预排序任务，以这种方式优化的嵌入一直优于谱图嵌入和各种学习实值嵌入的量化。
