##### Abstract
In the area of computer vision, deep learning has produced a variety of state-of-the-art models that rely on massive labeled data. However, collecting and annotating images from the real world has a great demand for labor and money investments and is usually too passive to build datasets with specific characteristics, such as small area of objects and high occlusion level. Under the framework of Parallel Vision, this paper presents a purposeful way to design artificial scenes and automatically generate virtual images with precise annotations. A virtual dataset named ParallelEye is built, which can be used for several computer vision tasks. Then, by training the DPM (Deformable Parts Model) and Faster R-CNN detectors, we prove that the performance of models can be significantly improved by combining ParallelEye with publicly available real-world datasets during the training phase. In addition, we investigate the potential of testing the trained models from a specific aspect using intentionally designed virtual datasets, in order to discover the flaws of trained models. From the experimental results, we conclude that our virtual dataset is viable to train and test the object detectors.

在计算机视觉领域，深度学习产生了依赖大量标记数据的各种最先进的模型。然而，从现实世界中收集和注释图像对于劳动力和金钱投资有很大的需求，通常对于建立具有小面积和高遮挡程度等特征的数据集通常过于被动。在并行视觉的框架下，本文提出了一种有意义的方法来设计人工场景，并自动生成具有精确注释的虚拟图像。建立一个名为ParallelEye的虚拟数据集，可以用于多个计算机视觉任务。然后，通过训练DPM（可变形部件模型）和更快的R-CNN检测器，证明在训练阶段，通过将ParallelEye与公开可用的真实世界数据集相结合，可以显着提高模型的性能。此外，我们还调查了使用有意设计的虚拟数据集从特定方面测试训练模型的潜力，以发现训练模型的缺陷。从实验结果，我们得出结论，我们的虚拟数据集是可行的训练和测试物体探测器。
