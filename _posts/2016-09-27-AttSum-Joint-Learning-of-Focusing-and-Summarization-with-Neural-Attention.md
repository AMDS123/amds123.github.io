##### Abstract
Query relevance ranking and sentence saliency ranking are the two main tasks in extractive query-focused summarization. Previous supervised summarization systems often perform the two tasks in isolation. However, since reference summaries are the trade-off between relevance and saliency, using them as supervision, neither of the two rankers could be trained well. This paper proposes a novel summarization system called AttSum, which tackles the two tasks jointly. It automatically learns distributed representations for sentences as well as the document cluster. Meanwhile, it applies the attention mechanism to simulate the attentive reading of human behavior when a query is given. Extensive experiments are conducted on DUC query-focused summarization benchmark datasets. Without using any hand-crafted features, AttSum achieves competitive performance. It is also observed that the sentences recognized to focus on the query indeed meet the query need.

##### Abstract (translated by Google)
查询相关性排名和句子显着性排名是提取式查询聚焦的两个主要任务。先前的监督式摘要系统经常独立执行这两项任务。然而，由于参考摘要是相关性和显着性之间的折中，所以将它们用作监督，两个跑步者都不会受到良好的训练。本文提出了一个名为AttSum的新型摘要系统，共同解决这两个任务。它会自动学习分布式表示以及文档集群。同时运用注意机制模拟人们在查询时对行为的细心阅读。在DUC基于查询的汇总基准数据集上进行了大量的实验。在不使用任何手工功能的情况下，AttSum可以实现有竞争力的性能。还可以观察到，确认专注于查询的句子确实满足查询需要。
