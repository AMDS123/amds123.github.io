##### Abstract
The Mohamed Bin Zayed International Robotics Challenge (MBZIRC) 2017 has defined ambitious new benchmarks to advance the state-of-the-art in autonomous operation of ground-based and flying robots. This article covers our approaches to solve the two challenges that involved micro aerial vehicles (MAV). Challenge 1 required reliable target perception, fast trajectory planning, and stable control of an MAV in order to land on a moving vehicle. Challenge 3 demanded a team of MAVs to perform a search and transportation task, coined "Treasure Hunt", which required mission planning and multi-robot coordination as well as adaptive control to account for the additional object weight. We describe our base MAV setup and the challenge-specific extensions, cover the camera-based perception, explain control and trajectory-planning in detail, and elaborate on mission planning and team coordination. We evaluated our systems in simulation as well as with real-robot experiments during the competition in Abu Dhabi. With our system, we-as part of the larger team NimbRo-won the MBZIRC Grand Challenge and achieved a third place in both subchallenges involving flying robots.
