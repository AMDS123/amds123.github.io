##### Abstract
As astronomers, we are living an exciting time for what concerns the search for other worlds. Recent discoveries have already deeply impacted our vision of planetary formation and architectures. Future bio-signature discoveries will probably deeply impact our scientific and philosophical understanding of life formation and evolution. In that unique perspective, the role of observation is crucial to extend our understanding of the formation and physics of giant planets shaping planetary systems. With the development of high contrast imaging techniques and instruments over more than two decades, vast efforts have been devoted to detect and characterize lighter, cooler and closer companions to nearby stars, and ultimately image new planetary systems. Complementary to other planet-hunting techniques, this approach has opened a new astrophysical window to study the physical properties and the formation mechanisms of brown dwarfs and planets. I will briefly review the different observing techniques and strategies used, the main samples of targeted stars, the key discoveries and surveys, to finally address the main results obtained so far about the physics and the mechanisms of formation and evolution of young giant planets and planetary system architectures.
