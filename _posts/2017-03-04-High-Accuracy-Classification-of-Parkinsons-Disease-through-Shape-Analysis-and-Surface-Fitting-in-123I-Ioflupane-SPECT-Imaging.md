##### Abstract
Early and accurate identification of parkinsonian syndromes (PS) involving presynaptic degeneration from non-degenerative variants such as Scans Without Evidence of Dopaminergic Deficit (SWEDD) and tremor disorders, is important for effective patient management as the course, therapy and prognosis differ substantially between the two groups. In this study, we use Single Photon Emission Computed Tomography (SPECT) images from healthy normal, early PD and SWEDD subjects, as obtained from the Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative (PPMI) database, and process them to compute shape- and surface fitting-based features for the three groups. We use these features to develop and compare various classification models that can discriminate between scans showing dopaminergic deficit, as in PD, from scans without the deficit, as in healthy normal or SWEDD. Along with it, we also compare these features with Striatal Binding Ratio (SBR)-based features, which are well-established and clinically used, by computing a feature importance score using Random forests technique. We observe that the Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier gave the best performance with an accuracy of 97.29%. These features also showed higher importance than the SBR-based features. We infer from the study that shape analysis and surface fitting are useful and promising methods for extracting discriminatory features that can be used to develop diagnostic models that might have the potential to help clinicians in the diagnostic process.

包括来自非变性变体的突触前变性的帕金森病综合征（PS）的早期和准确鉴定对于有效的患者管理是重要的，因为不具有多巴胺能缺陷（SWEDD）证据的扫描和震颤失调是重要的，因为疗程，疗法和预后在两组。在这项研究中，我们使用从帕金森病进展标志物计划（PPMI）数据库获得的健康正常，早期PD和SWEDD受试者的单光子发射计算机断层摄影（SPECT）图像，并且处理它们以计算基于形状和表面拟合的为三个小组的功能。我们使用这些功能开发和比较各种分类模型，可以区分显示多巴胺能缺乏的扫描，如在PD中，扫描没有缺陷，如健康正常或SWEDD。与此同时，我们还通过使用随机森林技术来计算特征重要性分数，将这些特征与已经建立和临床使用的基于纹饰结合比（SBR）的特征进行比较。我们观察到支持向量机（SVM）分类器给出了最好的性能，准确率为97.29％。这些特征也显示出比基于SBR的特征更高的重要性。我们从这项研究推断，形状分析和表面拟合是有用和有前途的提取歧视性特征的方法，可用于开发可能有助于临床医生在诊断过程中的诊断模型。
