##### Abstract
The magnetic anisotropy of a planar array of Ga$_{x}$Fe$_{4-x}$N nanocrystals (NCs) embedded in a GaN host is studied by ferromagnetic resonance. X-ray diffraction and transmission electron microscopy are employed to determine the phase and distribution of the nanocrystals. The magnetic anisotropy is found to be primarily uniaxial with the hard axis normal to the NCs plane and to have a comparably weak in-plane hexagonal symmetry. The origin of the magnetic anisotropy is discussed taking into consideration the morphology of the nanocrystals, the epitaxial relations, strain effects and magnetic coupling between the NCs.
