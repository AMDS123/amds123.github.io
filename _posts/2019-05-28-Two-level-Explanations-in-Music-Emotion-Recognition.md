##### Abstract
Current ML models for music emotion recognition, while generally working quite well, do not give meaningful or intuitive explanations for their predictions. In this work, we propose a 2-step procedure to arrive at spectrogram-level explanations that connect certain aspects of the audio to interpretable mid-level perceptual features, and these to the actual emotion prediction. That makes it possible to focus on specific musical reasons for a prediction (in terms of perceptual features), and to trace these back to patterns in the audio that can be interpreted visually and acoustically.
