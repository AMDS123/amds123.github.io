##### Abstract
Visual Place Recognition (VPR) has seen significant advances at the frontiers of matching performance and computational superiority over the past few years. However, these evaluations are performed for ground-based mobile platforms and cannot be generalized to aerial platforms. The degree of viewpoint variation experienced by aerial robots is complex, with their processing power and on-board memory limited by payload size and battery ratings. Therefore, in this paper, we collect $8$ state-of-the-art VPR techniques that have been previously evaluated for ground-based platforms and compare them on $2$ recently proposed aerial place recognition datasets with three prime focuses: a) Matching performance b) Processing power consumption c) Projected memory requirements. This gives a birds-eye view of the applicability of contemporary VPR research to aerial robotics and lays down the the nature of challenges for aerial-VPR.
