##### Abstract
Purpose: This paper focuses on an automated analysis of surgical motion profiles for objective skill assessment and task recognition in robot-assisted surgery. Existing techniques heavily rely on conventional statistic measures or shallow modelings based on hand-engineered features and gesture segmentation. Such developments require significant expert knowledge, are prone to errors, and are less efficient in online adaptive training systems. Methods: In this work, we present an efficient analytic framework with a parallel deep learning architecture, SATR-DL, to assess trainee expertise and recognize surgical training activity. Through an end-to-end learning technique, abstract information of spatial representations and temporal dynamics is jointly obtained directly from raw motion sequences. Results: By leveraging a shared high-level representation learning, the resulting model is successful in the recognition of trainee skills and surgical tasks, suturing, needle-passing, and knot-tying. Meanwhile, we explore the use of ensemble in classification at the trial level, where the SATR-DL outperforms state-of-the-art performance by achieving accuracies of 0.960 and 1.000 in skill assessment and task recognition, respectively. Conclusion: This study highlights the potential of SATR-DL to provide improvements for an efficient data-driven assessment in intelligent robotic surgery.

目的：本文侧重于对机器人辅助手术中客观技能评估和任务识别的手术运动轮廓进行自动分析。现有技术严重依赖于传统的统计度量或基于手工设计特征和手势分割的浅层模型。这种发展需要大量的专业知识，容易出错，并且在线自适应培训系统效率较低。方法：在这项工作中，我们提出了一个高效的分析框架和并行深度学习架构SATR-DL，以评估学员的专业知识并识别手术培训活动。通过端到端的学习技术，空间表示和时间动态的抽象信息直接从原始运动序列中获得。结果：通过利用共享的高级表示学习，所得到的模型在识别学员技能和手术任务，缝合，穿针和打结方面是成功的。同时，我们探索了在试验级别使用集合进行分类，SATR-DL分别在技能评估和任务识别中获得了0.960和1.000的准确度，并且性能超过了最新的性能。结论：本研究突出了SATR-DL在智能机器人手术中提供有效数据驱动评估的潜力。
