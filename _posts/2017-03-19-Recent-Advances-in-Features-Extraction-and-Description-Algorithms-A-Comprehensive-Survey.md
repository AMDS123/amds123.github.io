##### Abstract
Computer vision is one of the most active research fields in information technology today. Giving machines and robots the ability to see and comprehend the surrounding world at the speed of sight creates endless potential applications and opportunities. Feature detection and description algorithms can be indeed considered as the retina of the eyes of such machines and robots. However, these algorithms are typically computationally intensive, which prevents them from achieving the speed of sight real-time performance. In addition, they differ in their capabilities and some may favor and work better given a specific type of input compared to others. As such, it is essential to compactly report their pros and cons as well as their performances and recent advances. This paper is dedicated to provide a comprehensive overview on the state-of-the-art and recent advances in feature detection and description algorithms. Specifically, it starts by overviewing fundamental concepts. It then compares, reports and discusses their performance and capabilities. The Maximally Stable Extremal Regions algorithm and the Scale Invariant Feature Transform algorithms, being two of the best of their type, are selected to report their recent algorithmic derivatives.

计算机视觉是当今信息技术中最活跃的研究领域之一。让机器和机器人以视觉的速度看待和理解周围世界的能力创造了无限的潜在应用和机会。特征检测和描述算法可以被认为是这种机器和机器人眼睛的视网膜。然而，这些算法通常是计算密集型的，这妨碍了它们实现视距实时性能的速度。另外，他们的能力有所不同，有些人可能比其他人更喜欢和更好地工作。因此，要紧凑地报告他们的利弊，以及他们的表现和最近的进展是至关重要的。本文旨在全面介绍特征检测和描述算法的最新进展。具体来说，它首先概述基本概念。然后比较，报告和讨论他们的表现和能力。最大稳定极值区域算法和尺度不变特征变换算法是其中最好的两种，被选中来报告它们最近的算法衍生物。
