##### Abstract
Transparent surfaces, such as glass, transmit most of the visible light that falls on them, making accurate pose estimation challenging. We propose a method to locate glass objects to millimetre accuracy using a simple Laser Range Finder (LRF) attached to the robot end-effector. The method, derived from a physical understanding of laser-glass interactions, consists of (i) sampling points on the glass border by looking at the glass surface from an angle of approximately 45 degrees, and (ii) performing Iterative Closest Point registration on the sampled points. We verify experimentally that the proposed method can locate a transparent, non-planar, side car glass to millimetre accuracy.
