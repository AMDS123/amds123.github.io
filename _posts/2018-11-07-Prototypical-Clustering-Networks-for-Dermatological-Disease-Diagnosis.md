##### Abstract
We consider the problem of image classification for the purpose of aiding doctors in dermatological diagnosis. Dermatological diagnosis poses two major challenges for standard off-the-shelf techniques: First, the data distribution is typically extremely long tailed. Second, intra-class variability is often large. To address the first issue, we formulate the problem as low-shot learning, where once deployed, a base classifier must rapidly generalize to diagnose novel conditions given very few labeled examples. To model diverse classes effectively, we propose Prototypical Clustering Networks (PCN), an extension to Prototypical Networks that learns a mixture of prototypes for each class. Prototypes are initialized for each class via clustering and refined via an online update scheme. Classification is performed by measuring similarity to a weighted combination of prototypes within a class, where the weights are the inferred cluster responsibilities. We demonstrate the strengths of our approach in effective diagnosis on a realistic dataset of dermatological conditions.
