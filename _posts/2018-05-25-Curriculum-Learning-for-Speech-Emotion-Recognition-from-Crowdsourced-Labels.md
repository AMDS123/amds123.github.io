##### Abstract
This study introduces a method to design a curriculum for machine-learning to maximize the efficiency during the training process of deep neural networks (DNNs) for speech emotion recognition. Previous studies in other machine-learning problems have shown the benefits of training a classifier following a curriculum where samples are gradually presented in increasing level of difficulty. For speech emotion recognition, the challenge is to establish a natural order of difficulty in the training set to create the curriculum. We address this problem by assuming that ambiguous samples for humans are also ambiguous for computers. Speech samples are often annotated by multiple evaluators to account for differences in emotion perception across individuals. While some sentences with clear emotional content are consistently annotated, sentences with more ambiguous emotional content present important disagreement between individual evaluations. We propose to use the disagreement between evaluators as a measure of difficulty for the classification task. We propose metrics that quantify the inter-evaluation agreement to define the curriculum for regression problems and binary and multi-class classification problems. The experimental results consistently show that relying on a curriculum based on agreement between human judgments leads to statistically significant improvements over baselines trained without a curriculum.

本研究引入了一种设计机器学习课程的方法，以在用于语音情感识别的深度神经网络（DNN）的训练过程中最大化效率。以前在其他机器学习问题上的研究已经显示了随着课程逐渐呈现渐增难度的样本而训练分类器的益处。对于语音情感识别来说，挑战是在训练集中建立一个自然的难度顺序来创建课程。我们通过假设人类的模糊样本对计算机也不明确来解决这个问题。语音样本通常由多位评估人员注释，以解释个人情感认知的差异。尽管一些含有明确情绪内容的句子被一致注释，但含有更多含糊情绪内容的句子在个别评价之间呈现出重要的分歧。我们建议使用评估者之间的分歧作为分类任务难度的度量。我们提出量化评估协议的指标来定义回归问题以及二元和多类分类问题的课程。实验结果一致表明，依靠基于人类判断之间一致性的课程导致统计学显着改善超过没有课程训练的基线。
