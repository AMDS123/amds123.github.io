##### Abstract
Syntactic parsing, the process of obtaining the internal structure of sentences in natural languages, is a crucial task for artificial intelligence applications that need to extract meaning from natural language text or speech. Sentiment analysis is one example of application for which parsing has recently proven useful. In recent years, there have been significant advances in the accuracy of parsing algorithms. In this article, we perform an empirical, task-oriented evaluation to determine how parsing accuracy influences the performance of a state-of-the-art rule-based sentiment analysis system that determines the polarity of sentences from their parse trees. In particular, we evaluate the system using four well-known dependency parsers, including both current models with state-of-the-art accuracy and more innacurate models which, however, require less computational resources. The experiments show that all of the parsers produce similarly good results in the sentiment analysis task, without their accuracy having any relevant influence on the results. Since parsing is currently a task with a relatively high computational cost that varies strongly between algorithms, this suggests that sentiment analysis researchers and users should prioritize speed over accuracy when choosing a parser; and parsing researchers should investigate models that improve speed further, even at some cost to accuracy.

句法分析是获取自然语言句子内部结构的过程，对于需要从自然语言文本或语音中提取意义的人工智能应用来说，是一个至关重要的任务。情感分析是解析最近证明有用的应用程序的一个例子。近年来，解析算法的准确性有了显着提高。在本文中，我们进行了一个经验性的，面向任务的评估，以确定分析的准确性如何影响最先进的基于规则的情感分析系统的性能，从而确定句子从其分析树的极性。具体来说，我们使用四个众所周知的依赖分析器来评估系统，包括具有最新准确度的当前模型和更多不确定性模型，然而这些模型需要较少的计算资源。实验表明，所有的解析器在情感分析任务中都会产生相似的好结果，而不会影响结果的准确性。由于解析目前是一个计算成本相对较高的任务，算法之间差异很大，这表明情绪分析研究人员和用户应该优先选择解析器的速度超过准确性;解析的研究人员应该调查模型，进一步提高速度，即使在一定的成本精度。
