##### Abstract
As autonomous agents become more ubiquitous, they will eventually have to reason about the mental state of other agents, including those agents' beliefs, desires and goals - so-called theory of mind reasoning. We introduce a collection of increasingly complex theory of mind models of a "chaser" pursuing a "runner", known as the Chaser-Runner model. We show that our implementation is a relatively straightforward theory of mind model that can capture a variety of rich behaviors, which in turn, increase runner detection rates relative to basic (non-theory-of-mind) models. In addition, our paper demonstrates that (1) using a planning-as-inference formulation based on nested importance sampling results in agents simultaneously reasoning about other agents' plans and crafting counter-plans, (2) probabilistic programming is a natural way to describe models in which each uses complex primitives such as path planners to make decisions, and (3) allocating additional computation to perform nested reasoning about agents result in lower-variance estimates of expected utility.
