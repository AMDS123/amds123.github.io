##### Abstract
Speaker adaptation aims to estimate a speaker specific acoustic model from a speaker independent one to minimize the mismatch between the training and testing conditions arisen from speaker variabilities. A variety of neural network adaptation methods have been proposed since deep learning models have become the main stream. But there still lacks an experimental comparison between different methods, especially when DNN-based acoustic models have been advanced greatly. In this paper, we aim to close this gap by providing an empirical evaluation of three typical speaker adaptation methods: LIN, LHUC and KLD. Adaptation experiments, with different size of adaptation data, are conducted on a strong TDNN-LSTM acoustic model. More challengingly, here, the source and target we are concerned with are standard Mandarin speaker model and accented Mandarin speaker model. We compare the performances of different methods and their combinations. Speaker adaptation performance is also examined by speaker's accent degree.

说话者适应旨在从不依赖说话者的角度估计说话者特定的声学模型，以最小化由说话者可变性产生的训练和测试条件之间的不匹配。由于深度学习模型已成为主流，因此已经提出了各种神经网络适应方法。但是仍然缺乏对不同方法的实验比较，特别是当基于DNN的声学模型得到很大发展时。在本文中，我们旨在通过对三种典型的说话人适应方法：LIN，LHUC和KLD进行实证评估来缩小差距。采用强大的TDNN-LSTM声学模型进行具有不同尺寸适应数据的适应实验。更具挑战性的是，在这里，我们所关注的来源和目标是标准的普通话说话人模式和重音普通话说话人模式。我们比较不同方法和组合的表现。说话者适应性能也由说话者的重音程度来检验。
