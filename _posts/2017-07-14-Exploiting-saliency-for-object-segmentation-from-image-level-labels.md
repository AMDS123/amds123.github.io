##### Abstract
There have been remarkable improvements in the semantic labelling task in the recent years. However, the state of the art methods rely on large-scale pixel-level annotations. This paper studies the problem of training a pixel-wise semantic labeller network from image-level annotations of the present object classes. Recently, it has been shown that high quality seeds indicating discriminative object regions can be obtained from image-level labels. Without additional information, obtaining the full extent of the object is an inherently ill-posed problem due to co-occurrences. We propose using a saliency model as additional information and hereby exploit prior knowledge on the object extent and image statistics. We show how to combine both information sources in order to recover 80% of the fully supervised performance - which is the new state of the art in weakly supervised training for pixel-wise semantic labelling. The code is available at this https URL

近年来语义标注任务有了显着的提高。但是，最先进的方法依赖于大规模的像素级注释。本文研究了从当前对象类的图像级注释训练像素级语义标签网络的问题。最近，已经表明，可以从图像级标签获得指示有区别对象区域的高质量种子。如果没有额外的信息，获取对象的全部范围是由于共现导致的本质上不适当的问题。我们建议使用显着性模型作为附加信息，并借此利用对象范围和图像统计的先验知识。我们展示了如何结合两个信息源，以恢复完全监督的性能的80％ - 这是在针对像素的语义标签的弱监督训练中的新的技术状态。该代码可在此https网址获得
