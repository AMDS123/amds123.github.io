##### Abstract
Lexical Markup Framework (LMF) or ISO 24613 [1] is a de jure standard that provides a framework for modelling and encoding lexical information in retrodigitised print dictionaries and NLP lexical databases. An in-depth review is currently underway within the standardisation subcommittee , ISO-TC37/SC4/WG4, to find a more modular, flexible and durable follow up to the original LMF standard published in 2008. In this paper we will present some of the major improvements which have so far been implemented in the new version of LMF.
