##### Abstract
Achieving a symbiotic blending between reality and virtuality is a dream that has been lying in the minds of many people for a long time. Advances in various domains constantly bring us closer to making that dream come true. Augmented reality as well as virtual reality are in fact trending terms and are expected to further progress in the years to come. This master's thesis aims to explore these areas and starts by defining necessary terms such as augmented reality (AR) or virtual reality (VR). Usual taxonomies to classify and compare the corresponding experiences are then discussed. In order to enable those applications, many technical challenges need to be tackled, such as accurate motion tracking with 6 degrees of freedom (positional and rotational), that is necessary for compelling experiences and to prevent user sickness. Additionally, augmented reality experiences typically rely on image processing to position the superimposed content. To do so, "paper" markers or features extracted from the environment are often employed. Both sets of techniques are explored and common solutions and algorithms are presented. After investigating those technical aspects, I carry out an objective comparison of the existing state-of-the-art and state-of-the-practice in those domains, and I discuss present and potential applications in these areas. As a practical validation, I present the results of an application that I have developed using Microsoft HoloLens, one of the more advanced affordable technologies for augmented reality that is available today. Based on the experience and lessons learned during this development, I discuss the limitations of current technologies and present some avenues of future research.

##### Abstract (translated by Google)
在现实和虚拟之间实现共生共融是长久以来在许多人心目中的梦想。各个领域的进步不断使我们更加接近实现梦想。增强现实和虚拟现实实际上是趋势性的，预计未来几年会有进一步的发展。这位硕士论文旨在探索这些领域，并开始定义必要的术语，如增强现实（AR）或虚拟现实（VR）。然后讨论常用分类法对相应的经验进行分类和比较。为了实现这些应用，需要解决许多技术难题，例如6度自由度（位置和旋转）的精确运动跟踪，这是引人注目的体验和防止用户疾病所必需的。另外，增强现实体验通常依靠图像处理来定位叠加的内容。为此，经常使用从环境中提取的“纸”标记或特征。这两套技术进行了探索，并提出了常见的解决方案和算法。在对这些技术方面进行调查之后，我对这些领域中现有的最新技术和实践状况进行了客观比较，并讨论了这些领域的现状和潜在应用。作为一个实际的验证，我展示了我使用Microsoft HoloLens开发的应用程序的结果，这是现今可用的增强现实中更先进的经济实惠技术之一。基于这一发展过程中的经验和教训，我将探讨当前技术的局限性，并提出未来研究的一些途径。
