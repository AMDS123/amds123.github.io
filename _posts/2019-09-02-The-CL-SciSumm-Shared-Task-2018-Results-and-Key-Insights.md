##### Abstract
This overview describes the official results of the CL-SciSumm Shared Task 2018 -- the first medium-scale shared task on scientific document summarization in the computational linguistics (CL) domain. This year, the dataset comprised 60 annotated sets of citing and reference papers from the open access research papers in the CL domain. The Shared Task was organized as a part of the 41st Annual Conference of the Special Interest Group in Information Retrieval (SIGIR), held in Ann Arbor, USA in July 2018. We compare the participating systems in terms of two evaluation metrics. The annotated dataset and evaluation scripts can be accessed and used by the community from: \url{https://github.com/WING-NUS/scisumm-corpus}.
