##### Abstract
This paper implements Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) technique to construct a map of a given environment. A Real Time Appearance Based Mapping (RTAB-Map) approach was taken for accomplishing this task. Initially, a 2d occupancy grid and 3d octomap was created from a provided simulated environment. Next, a personal simulated environment was created for mapping as well. In this appearance based method, a process called Loop Closure is used to determine whether a robot has seen a location before or not. In this paper, it is seen that RTAB-Map is optimized for large scale and long term SLAM by using multiple strategies to allow for loop closure to be done in real time and the results depict that it can be an excellent solution for SLAM to develop robots that can map an environment in both 2d and 3d.

本文实现了同时定位和映射（SLAM）技术来构建给定环境的地图。采用基于实时外观的映射（RTAB-Map）方法来完成该任务。最初，从提供的模拟环境创建了2d占用网格和3d octomap。接下来，还创建了用于映射的个人模拟环境。在这种基于外观的方法中，使用称为Loop Closure的过程来确定机器人之前是否已经看过位置。在本文中，通过使用多种策略允许实时完成循环闭包，可以看出RTAB-Map针对大规模和长期SLAM进行了优化，结果表明它可以成为SLAM开发的优秀解决方案可以在2d和3d中映射环境的机器人。
