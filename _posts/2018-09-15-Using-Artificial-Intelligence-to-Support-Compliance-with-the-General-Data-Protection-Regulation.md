##### Abstract
The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is a European Union regulation that will replace the existing Data Protection Directive on 25 May 2018. The most significant change is a huge increase in the maximum fine that can be levied for breaches of the regulation. Yet fewer than half of UK companies are fully aware of GDPR - and a number of those who were preparing for it stopped doing so when the Brexit vote was announced. A last-minute rush to become compliant is therefore expected, and numerous companies are starting to offer advice, checklists and consultancy on how to comply with GDPR. In such an environment, artificial intelligence technologies ought to be able to assist by providing best advice; asking all and only the relevant questions; monitoring activities; and carrying out assessments. The paper considers four areas of GDPR compliance where rule based technologies and/or machine learning techniques may be relevant: * Following compliance checklists and codes of conduct; * Supporting risk assessments; * Complying with the new regulations regarding technologies that perform automatic profiling; * Complying with the new regulations concerning recognising and reporting breaches of security. It concludes that AI technology can support each of these four areas. The requirements that GDPR (or organisations that need to comply with GDPR) state for explanation and justification of reasoning imply that rule-based approaches are likely to be more helpful than machine learning approaches. However, there may be good business reasons to take a different approach in some circumstances.

##### Abstract (translated by Google)
通用数据保护法规（GDPR）是欧盟法规，将于2018年5月25日取代现有的数据保护指令。最重要的变化是违反法规可以征收的最高罚款额度大幅增加。然而，只有不到一半的英国公司完全了解GDPR--在英国脱欧公投时，一些准备这样做的公司已停止这样做了。因此，预计最后一刻会急于变得合规，许多公司开始就如何遵守GDPR提供建议，检查清单和咨询。在这样的环境中，人工智能技术应该能够通过提供最好的建议来提供帮助;询问所有相关问题;监测活动;并进行评估。本文考虑了GDPR合规的四个方面，其中基于规则的技术和/或机器学习技术可能是相关的：*遵循合规性检查表和行为准则; *支持风险评估; *遵守有关执行自动分析的技术的新规定; *遵守有关识别和报告违反安全规定的新规定。它的结论是，AI技术可以支持这四个领域中的每一个。 GDPR（或需要遵守GDPR的组织）声明解释和推理理由的要求意味着基于规则的方法可能比机器学习方法更有帮助。但是，在某些情况下采取不同的方法可能有很好的商业理由。
