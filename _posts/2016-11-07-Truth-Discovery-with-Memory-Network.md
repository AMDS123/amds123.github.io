##### Abstract
Truth discovery is to resolve conflicts and find the truth from multiple-source statements. Conventional methods mostly research based on the mutual effect between the reliability of sources and the credibility of statements, however, pay no attention to the mutual effect among the credibility of statements about the same object. We propose memory network based models to incorporate these two ideas to do the truth discovery. We use feedforward memory network and feedback memory network to learn the representation of the credibility of statements which are about the same object. Specially, we adopt memory mechanism to learn source reliability and use it through truth prediction. During learning models, we use multiple types of data (categorical data and continuous data) by assigning different weights automatically in the loss function based on their own effect on truth discovery prediction. The experiment results show that the memory network based models much outperform the state-of-the-art method and other baseline methods.

真相发现是解决冲突，从多源声明中找出真相。传统的方法大多是基于信源的可靠性与陈述的可信度之间的相互作用来进行研究，而不关注同一个对象的陈述的可信度之间的相互影响。我们提出了基于内存网络的模型来融合这两个想法来做真相发现。我们使用前馈记忆网络和反馈记忆网络来学习关于同一个对象的陈述可信度的表示。特别地，我们采用记忆机制来学习源可靠性，并通过真实预测来使用它。在学习模型中，我们使用多种类型的数据（分类数据和连续数据），根据自身对真实发现预测的影响，在损失函数中自动分配不同的权重。实验结果表明，基于记忆网络的模型比现有方法和其他基线方法的性能要好得多。
