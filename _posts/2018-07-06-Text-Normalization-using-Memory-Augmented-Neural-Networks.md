##### Abstract
We perform text normalization, i.e. the transformation of words from the written to the spoken form, using a memory augmented neural network. With the addition of dynamic memory access and storage mechanism, we present a neural architecture that will serve as a language agnostic text normalization system while avoiding the kind of unacceptable errors made by the LSTM based recurrent neural networks. By reducing the number of unacceptable mistakes, we show that such a novel architecture is indeed a better alternative. Our proposed system requires significantly lesser amounts of data, training time and compute resources. Although a few occurrences of these errors still remain in certain semiotic classes, we demonstrate that memory augmented networks with meta-learning capabilities can open many doors to a superior text normalization system.

我们使用记忆增强神经网络执行文本标准化，即从书面形式到口语形式的单词转换。通过添加动态内存访问和存储机制，我们提出了一种神经架构，它将作为语言无关的文本规范化系统，同时避免基于LSTM的递归神经网络产生的那种不可接受的错误。通过减少不可接受的错误数量，我们表明这种新颖的架构确实是一个更好的选择。我们提出的系统需要的数据量，培训时间和计算资源都要少得多。尽管在某些符号学类中仍然存在少数这些错误，但我们证明具有元学习能力的内存增强网络可以为优秀的文本规范化系统打开许多大门。
