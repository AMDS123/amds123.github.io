##### Abstract
Skin cancer, the most common human malignancy, is primarily diagnosed visually by physicians [1]. Classification with an automated method like CNN [2, 3] shows potential for challenging tasks [1]. By now, the deep convolutional neural networks are on par with human dermatologist [1]. This abstract is dedicated on developing a Deep Learning method for ISIC [5] 2017 Skin Lesion Detection Competition hosted at [6] to classify the dermatology pictures, which is aimed at improving the diagnostic accuracy rate and general level of the human health. The challenge falls into three sub-challenges, including Lesion Segmentation, Lesion Dermoscopic Feature Extraction and Lesion Classification. This project only participates in the Lesion Classification part. This algorithm is comprised of three steps: (1) original images preprocessing, (2) modelling the processed images using CNN [2, 3] in Caffe [4] framework, (3) predicting the test images and calculating the scores that represent the likelihood of corresponding classification. The models are built on the source images are using the Caffe [4] framework. The scores in prediction step are obtained by two different models from the source images.

皮肤癌是最常见的人类恶性肿瘤，主要由医生直观诊断[1]。用像CNN这样的自动化方法进行分类[2,3]显示出具有挑战性任务的潜力[1]。到目前为止，深度卷积神经网络与人类皮肤科医生[1]是一致的。本文摘要致力于发展一种深度学习法[5] 2017年皮肤病变检测竞赛[6]，对皮肤病学图片进行分类，旨在提高诊断准确率和人体健康水平。这个挑战分为三个子挑战，包括病灶分割，病灶皮肤镜特征提取和病变分类。该项目只参与病变分类部分。该算法由三个步骤组成：（1）原始图像预处理，（2）在Caffe [4]框架中使用CNN [2,3]对处理后的图像进行建模，（3）预测测试图像并计算代表相应分类的可能性。模型是建立在源图像上使用Caffe [4]框架。预测步骤中的得分由源图像中的两个不同模型获得。
