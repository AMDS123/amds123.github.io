##### Abstract
Low Dose Computed Tomography (LDCT) has offered tremendous benefits in radiation restricted applications, but the quantum noise as resulted by the insufficient number of photons could potentially harm the diagnostic performance. Current image-based denoising methods tend to produce a blur effect on the final reconstructed results especially in high noise levels. In this paper, a deep learning based approach was proposed to mitigate this problem. An adversarially trained network and a sharpness detection network were trained to guide the training process. Experiments on both simulated and real dataset shows that the results of the proposed method have very small resolution loss and achieves better performance relative to the-state-of-art methods both quantitatively and visually.

低剂量计算机断层扫描（LDCT）在限制辐射的应用中提供了巨大的好处，但由于光子数量不足造成的量子噪声可能会损害诊断性能。目前的基于图像的去噪方法倾向于对最终的重构结果产生模糊效果，尤其是在高噪声水平下。在本文中，提出了一个深度学习的方法来缓解这个问题。训练有素的网络和清晰度检测网络，以指导培训过程。在模拟和实际数据集上的实验表明，所提出的方法的结果具有非常小的分辨率损失，并且在数量和视觉上相对于现有技术方法具有更好的性能。
