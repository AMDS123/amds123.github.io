##### Abstract
In current state-of-the-art commercial first person shooter games, computer controlled bots, also known as non player characters, can often be easily distinguishable from those controlled by humans. Tell-tale signs such as failed navigation, "sixth sense" knowledge of human players' whereabouts and deterministic, scripted behaviors are some of the causes of this. We propose, however, that one of the biggest indicators of non humanlike behavior in these games can be found in the weapon shooting capability of the bot. Consistently perfect accuracy and "locking on" to opponents in their visual field from any distance are indicative capabilities of bots that are not found in human players. Traditionally, the bot is handicapped in some way with either a timed reaction delay or a random perturbation to its aim, which doesn't adapt or improve its technique over time. We hypothesize that enabling the bot to learn the skill of shooting through trial and error, in the same way a human player learns, will lead to greater variation in game-play and produce less predictable non player characters. This paper describes a reinforcement learning shooting mechanism for adapting shooting over time based on a dynamic reward signal from the amount of damage caused to opponents.

在当前最先进的商业第一人称射击游戏中，计算机控制的机器人，也称为非玩家角色，通常可以很容易地与人类控制的那些区别开来。例如导航失败等告知信号，人类参与者的下落和确定性的脚本行为的“第六感”知识是造成这种情况的一些原因。然而，我们建议这些游戏中非人类行为的最大指标之一可以在机器人的武器射击能力中找到。从任何距离始终保持完美的准确度和“锁定”在视野中的对手都是在玩家身上没有发现的机器人的指示性能力。传统上，机器人以某种方式受到阻碍，无论是时间反应延迟还是随机扰动都达不到其目的，而是随着时间的推移不适应或改进其技术。我们假设让机器人通过反复试验来学习拍摄技巧，就像人类玩家学习一样，将导致游戏玩法的变化更大，并产生可预测的非玩家角色。本文描述了一种强化学习拍摄机制，用于根据对对手造成的伤害量的动态奖励信号来适应长时间拍摄。
