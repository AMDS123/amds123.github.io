##### Abstract
Retinal images provide early signs of diabetic retinopathy, glaucoma, and hypertension. These signs can be investigated based on microaneurysms or smaller vessels. The diagnostic biomarkers are the change of vessel widths and angles especially at junctions, which are investigated using the vessel segmentation or tracking. Vessel paths may also be interrupted; crossings and bifurcations may be disconnected. This paper addresses a novel contextual method based on the geometry of the primary visual cortex (V1) to study these difficulties. We have analyzed the specific problems at junctions with a connectivity kernel obtained as the fundamental solution of the Fokker-Planck equation, which is usually used to represent the geometrical structure of multi-orientation cortical connectivity. Using the spectral clustering on a large local affinity matrix constructed by both the connectivity kernel and the feature of intensity, the vessels are identified successfully in a hierarchical topology each representing an individual perceptual unit.

视网膜图像提供糖尿病视网膜病变，青光眼和高血压的早期征兆。这些迹象可以基于微动脉瘤或小血管进行调查。诊断性生物标志物是血管宽度和角度的变化，特别是在使用血管分割或追踪进行研究的连接处。容器路径也可能被中断;交叉和分叉可能会断开。本文提出了一种基于初级视觉皮层（V1）的几何学的新颖的背景方法来研究这些困难。我们已经分析了连通核的交点处的具体问题，作为Fokker-Planck方程的基本解，这个方程通常用来表示多向皮层连通性的几何结构。利用由连通性内核和强度特征两者构建的大的局部亲和性矩阵的谱聚类，成功地在分层拓扑中识别血管，每个代表单个感知单位。
