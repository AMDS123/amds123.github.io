##### Abstract
In this contribution, we used the GrowCut segmentation algorithm publicly available in three-dimensional Slicer for three-dimensional segmentation of vertebral bodies. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that the GrowCut method has been studied for the usage of vertebral body segmentation. In brief, we found that the GrowCut segmentation times were consistently less than the manual segmentation times. Hence, GrowCut provides an alternative to a manual slice-by-slice segmentation process.

##### Abstract (translated by Google)
在这篇文章中，我们使用了三维切片机中公开的GrowCut分割算法来进行椎体的三维分割。就我们所知，这是GrowCut方法首次针对椎体分割的使用进行了研究。简而言之，我们发现GrowCut分段时间一直比手动分段时间少。因此，GrowCut提供了手动逐片分割过程的替代方案。
