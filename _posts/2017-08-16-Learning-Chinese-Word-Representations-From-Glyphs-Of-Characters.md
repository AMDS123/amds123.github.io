##### Abstract
In this paper, we propose new methods to learn Chinese word representations. Chinese characters are composed of graphical components, which carry rich semantics. It is common for a Chinese learner to comprehend the meaning of a word from these graphical components. As a result, we propose models that enhance word representations by character glyphs. The character glyph features are directly learned from the bitmaps of characters by convolutional auto-encoder(convAE), and the glyph features improve Chinese word representations which are already enhanced by character embeddings. Another contribution in this paper is that we created several evaluation datasets in traditional Chinese and made them public.

在本文中，我们提出了学习汉语词汇表征的新方法。汉字由图形组件组成，具有丰富的语义。中国学习者从这些图形组件中理解单词的含义是很常见的。因此，我们建议通过字符符号来增强单词表示的模型。卷积自动编码器（convAE）直接从字符位图中学习字符字形特征，字形特征提高了字符嵌入已经增强的中文字表示。本文的另一个贡献是我们创建了几个传统的评价数据集，并将它们公之于众。
