##### Abstract
In this paper we present a new definition of the distortion matrix for a score following framework based on DTW. The proposal consists of arranging the score information in a sequence of note combinations and learning a spectral pattern for each combination using instrument models. Then, the distortion matrix is computed using these spectral patterns and a novel decomposition of the input signal.
