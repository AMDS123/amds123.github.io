##### Abstract
Recently, machine learning techniques especially predictive modeling and pattern recognition in biomedical sciences from drug delivery system to medical imaging has become one of the important methods which are assisting researchers to have deeper understanding of entire issue and to solve complex medical problems. Deep learning is a powerful machine learning algorithm in classification while extracting low to high-level features. In this paper, we used convolutional neural network to classify Alzheimer's brain from normal healthy brain. The importance of classifying this kind of medical data is to potentially develop a predict model or system in order to recognize the type disease from normal subjects or to estimate the stage of the disease. Classification of clinical data such as Alzheimer's disease has been always challenging and most problematic part has been always selecting the most discriminative features. Using Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and the famous architecture LeNet-5, we successfully classified structural MRI data of Alzheimer's subjects from normal controls where the accuracy of test data on trained data reached 98.84%. This experiment suggests us the shift and scale invariant features extracted by CNN followed by deep learning classification is most powerful method to distinguish clinical data from healthy data in fMRI. This approach also enables us to expand our methodology to predict more complicated systems.

近年来，机器学习技术特别是生物医学领域从药物输送系统到医学成像的预测建模和模式识别已经成为帮助研究人员深入了解整个问题，解决复杂医学问题的重要手段之一。深度学习是一种强大的机器学习算法，在分类时提取低级到高级特征。在本文中，我们使用卷积神经网络从正常健康的大脑分类阿尔茨海默氏脑。对这种医学数据进行分类的重要性在于潜在地开发预测模型或系统以便识别来自正常受试者的类型疾病或估计疾病的阶段。临床数据如阿尔茨海默氏病的分类一直是挑战性的，最成问题的部分一直是选择最具判别力的特征。利用卷积神经网络（CNN）和着名的LeNet-5体系结构，成功地对来自正常对照的阿尔茨海默病患者的结构性MRI数据进行分类，训练数据的准确性达到98.84％。这个实验表明我们CNN提取的尺度不变特征和尺度不变特征，然后是深度学习分类是功能磁共振成像中临床数据与健康数据区分最有效的方法。这种方法也使我们能够扩展我们的方法来预测更复杂的系统。
