##### Abstract
Visual recognition and vision based retrieval of objects from large databases are tasks with a wide spectrum of potential applications. In this paper we propose a novel recognition method from video sequences suitable for retrieval from databases acquired in highly unconstrained conditions e.g. using a mobile consumer-level device such as a phone. On the lowest level, we represent each sequence as a 3D mesh of densely packed local appearance descriptors. While image plane geometry is captured implicitly by a large overlap of neighbouring regions from which the descriptors are extracted, 3D information is extracted by means of a descriptor transition table, learnt from a single sequence for each known gallery object. These allow us to connect local descriptors along the 3rd dimension (which corresponds to viewpoint changes), thus resulting in a set of variable length Markov chains for each video. The matching of two sets of such chains is formulated as a statistical hypothesis test, whereby a subset of each is chosen to maximize the likelihood that the corresponding video sequences show the same object. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is empirically evaluated on the Amsterdam Library of Object Images and a new highly challenging video data set acquired using a mobile phone. On both data sets our method is shown to be successful in recognition in the presence of background clutter and large viewpoint changes.

基于视觉识别和基于视觉的大型数据库对象检索是具有广泛潜在应用的任务。在本文中，我们提出了一种新的识别方法，适用于从非常限制条件下获取的数据库中检索的视频序列，使用手机等移动消费级设备。在最底层，我们将每个序列表示为密集包装的局部外观描述符的3D网格。虽然图像平面的几何形状是通过提取描述符的相邻区域的大量重叠来隐式捕获的，但3D信息是通过描述符转换表提取的，从每个已知图库对象的单个序列中学习。这些允许我们沿着第三维连接局部描述符（对应于视点变化），从而得到每个视频的一组可变长度马尔可夫链。两组这样的链的匹配被表述为统计假设检验，由此选择每一个的子集以最大化对应的视频序列显示相同对象的可能性。所提算法的有效性在阿姆斯特丹对象图像库和使用手机获取的新的极具挑战性的视频数据集上进行了实证评估。在这两个数据集上，我们的方法被证明在背景混乱和大视点变化的情况下成功识别。
