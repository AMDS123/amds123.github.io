##### Abstract
Much research has examined models for prediction of semantic labels or instances including dense pixel-wise prediction. The problem of predicting salient objects or regions of an image has also been examined in a similar light. With that said, there is an apparent relationship between these two problem domains in that the composition of a scene and associated semantic categories is certain to play into what is deemed salient. In this paper, we explore the relationship between these two problem domains. This is carried out in constructing deep neural networks that perform both predictions together albeit with different configurations for flow of conceptual information related to each distinct problem. This is accompanied by a detailed analysis of object co-occurrences that shed light on dataset bias and semantic precedence specific to individual categories.

许多研究已经研究了用于预测语义标签或实例的模型，包括密集像素预测。还以类似的方式检查了预测图像的显着对象或区域的问题。话虽如此，这两个问题域之间存在明显的关系，因为场景的组成和相关的语义类别肯定会发挥出被认为是显着的东西。在本文中，我们探讨了这两个问题域之间的关系。这是在构建深度神经网络时进行的，该深度神经网络一起执行两个预测，尽管对于与每个不同问题相关的概念信息的流动具有不同的配置。这伴随着对对象共现的详细分析，揭示了数据集偏差和特定于各个类别的语义优先级。
