##### Abstract
For pattern recognition like image recognition, it has become clear that each machine-learning dictionary data actually became data in probability space belonging to Euclidean space. However, the distances in the Euclidean space and the distances in the probability space are separated and ununified when machine learning is introduced in the pattern recognition. There is still a problem that it is impossible to directly calculate an accurate matching relation between the sampling data of the read image and the learned dictionary data. In this research, we focused on the reason why the distance is changed and the extent of change when passing through the probability space from the original Euclidean distance among data belonging to multiple probability spaces containing Euclidean space. By finding the reason of the cause of the distance error and finding the formula expressing the error quantitatively, a possible distance formula to unify Euclidean space and probability space is found. Based on the results of this research, the relationship between machine-learning dictionary data and sampling data was clearly understood for pattern recognition. As a result, the calculation of collation among data and machine-learning to compete mutually between data are cleared, and complicated calculations became unnecessary. Finally, using actual pattern recognition data, experimental demonstration of a possible distance formula to unify Euclidean space and probability space discovered by this research was carried out, and the effectiveness of the result was confirmed.

##### Abstract (translated by Google)
对于像图像识别这样的模式识别，已经清楚的是，每个机器学习字典数据实际上变成属于欧几里德空间的概率空间中的数据。然而，当模式识别中引入机器学习时，欧几里得空间中的距离和概率空间中的距离是分离的和不统一的。仍然存在不能直接计算读取图像的采样数据与学习的字典数据之间的精确匹配关系的问题。在这项研究中，我们重点介绍了距离变化的原因，以及属于多个包含欧几里得空间的概率空间的数据之间从原始欧几里德距离通过概率空间的变化程度。通过找出距离误差产生的原因，找到定量表示误差的公式，找到一个可能的欧氏空间与概率空间统一的距离公式。基于这个研究的结果，机器学习字典数据和采样数据之间的关系被清楚地理解为模式识别。结果，数据和机器学习之间的校对计算以在数据之间相互竞争被清除，并且不需要复杂的计算。最后，利用实际的模式识别数据，进行了本研究发现的欧氏空间与概率空间统一的可能距离公式的实验验证，并验证了结果的有效性。
