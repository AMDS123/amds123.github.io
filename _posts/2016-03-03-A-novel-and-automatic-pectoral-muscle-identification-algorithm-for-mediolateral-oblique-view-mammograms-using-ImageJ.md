##### Abstract
Pectoral muscle identification is often required for breast cancer risk analysis, such as estimating breast density. Traditional methods are overwhelmingly based on manual visual assessment or straight line fitting for the pectoral muscle boundary, which are inefficient and inaccurate since pectoral muscle in mammograms can have curved boundaries. This paper proposes a novel and automatic pectoral muscle identification algorithm for MLO view mammograms. It is suitable for both scanned film and full field digital mammograms. This algorithm is demonstrated using a public domain software ImageJ. A validation of this algorithm has been performed using real-world data and it shows promising result.

胸部肌肉鉴别通常用于乳腺癌风险分析，如估计乳房密度。传统方法绝大多数是基于手工视觉评估或胸肌边界的直线拟合，因为乳房X线照片中的胸肌可以具有弯曲的边界，所以效率低且不准确。本文提出了一种用于MLO视野乳房X线照片的新型自动胸肌识别算法。它适用于扫描胶片和全视野数字乳房X线照片。该算法使用公共领域软件ImageJ进行演示。该算法的验证已经使用真实世界的数据进行，并且显示出有希望的结果。
