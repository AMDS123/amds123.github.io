##### Abstract
In recent years, perceptual-quality driven super-resolution methods show satisfactory results. However, super-resolved images have uncertain texture details and unpleasant artifact. We build a novel perceptual loss function composed of morphological components adversarial loss and color adversarial loss and salient content loss to ameliorate these problems. The adversarial loss is applied to constrain color and morphological components distribution of super-resolved images and the salient content loss highlights the perceptual similarity of feature-rich regions. Experiments show that proposed method achieves significant improvements in terms of perceptual index and visual quality compared with the state-of-the-art methods.
