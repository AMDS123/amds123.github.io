##### Abstract
This work provides a framework for addressing the problem of supervised domain adaptation with deep models. The main idea is to exploit adversarial learning to learn an embedded subspace that simultaneously maximizes the confusion between two domains while semantically aligning their embedding. The supervised setting becomes attractive especially when there are only a few target data samples that need to be labeled. In this few-shot learning scenario, alignment and separation of semantic probability distributions is difficult because of the lack of data. We found that by carefully designing a training scheme whereby the typical binary adversarial discriminator is augmented to distinguish between four different classes, it is possible to effectively address the supervised adaptation problem. In addition, the approach has a high speed of adaptation, i.e. it requires an extremely low number of labeled target training samples, even one per category can be effective. We then extensively compare this approach to the state of the art in domain adaptation in two experiments: one using datasets for handwritten digit recognition, and one using datasets for visual object recognition.

这项工作提供了一个框架来解决监督领域适应与深模型的问题。主要思想是利用敌对学习来学习一个嵌入子空间，同时最大化两个域之间的混淆，同时语义上对齐它们的嵌入。监督设置变得有吸引力，特别是当只有少数目标数据样本需要标记时。在这种少数情况下，由于缺乏数据，语义概率分布的对齐和分离是困难的。我们发现，通过仔细设计一个训练方案，典型的二进制对抗鉴别器被加强，以区分四个不同的类别，有可能有效地解决监督适应问题。此外，该方法具有很高的适应速度，即需要极少数标记的目标训练样本，即使每个类别都有效。然后，我们在两个实验中广泛地将这种方法与领域适应性领域的现状进行了比较：一个使用数据集进行手写数字识别，另一个使用数据集进行视觉对象识别。
