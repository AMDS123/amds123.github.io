##### Abstract
Image-based vibration mode identification gained increased attentions in civil and construction communities. A recent video-based motion magnification method was developed to measure and visualize small structure motions. This new approach presents a potential for low-cost vibration measurement and mode shape identification. Pilot studies using this approach on simple rigid body structures was reported. Its validity on complex outdoor structures have not been investigated. The objective is to investigate the capacity of video-based motion magnification approach in measuring the modal frequency and visualizing the mode shapes of complex steel bridges. A novel method that increases the performance of the current motion magnification for efficient structure modal analysis is introduced. This method was tested in both indoor and outdoor environments for validation. The results of the investigation show that motion magnification can be an efficient tool for modal analysis on complex bridge structures. With the developed method, mode frequencies of multiple structures are simultaneously measured and mode shapes of each structure are automatically visualized.

基于图像的振动模式识别在民用和建筑界获得了越来越多的关注。最近开发了基于视频的运动放大方法来测量和可视化小型结构运动。这种新方法提供了低成本振动测量和模态识别的潜力。报道了在简单的刚体结构上使用这种方法的试验性研究。尚未对其在复杂户外结构上的有效性进行调查。其目的是研究基于视频的运动放大方法在测量模态频率和显示复杂钢桥模态的能力。介绍了一种提高当前运动放大率的高效结构模态分析的新方法。这种方法已经在室内和室外环境中进行了验证。调查结果表明运动放大倍数可以作为复杂桥梁结构模态分析的有效工具。通过开发的方法，可以同时测量多个结构的模态频率，并自动显示每个结构的振型。
