##### Abstract
We study the use of greedy feature selection methods for morphosyntactic tagging under a number of different conditions. We compare a static ordering of features to a dynamic ordering based on mutual information statistics, and we apply the techniques to standalone taggers as well as joint systems for tagging and parsing. Experiments on five languages show that feature selection can result in more compact models as well as higher accuracy under all conditions, but also that a dynamic ordering works better than a static ordering and that joint systems benefit more than standalone taggers. We also show that the same techniques can be used to select which morphosyntactic categories to predict in order to maximize syntactic accuracy in a joint system. Our final results represent a substantial improvement of the state of the art for several languages, while at the same time reducing both the number of features and the running time by up to 80% in some cases.

我们研究了贪婪特征选择方法在多种不同条件下形态句法标注的使用。我们将特征的静态排序与基于互信息统计的动态排序进行比较，并将这些技术应用于独立标记器以及用于标记和解析的联合系统。五种语言的实验表明，特征选择可以导致更紧凑的模型以及更高的准确性在所有条件下，而且动态排序比静态排序效果更好，并且联合系统比独立标签者更有利。我们还表明，可以使用相同的技术来选择要预测哪种形态句法类别，以最大化联合系统中的语法准确性。我们的最终结果代表了几种语言的最新技术水平的显着提高，同时在某些情况下，功能数量和运行时间减少了高达80％。
