##### Abstract
Person Re-IDentification (Re-ID) aims to match person images captured from two non-overlapping cameras. In this paper, a deep hybrid similarity learning (DHSL) method for person Re-ID based on a convolution neural network (CNN) is proposed. In our approach, a CNN learning feature pair for the input image pair is simultaneously extracted. Then, both the element-wise absolute difference and multiplication of the CNN learning feature pair are calculated. Finally, a hybrid similarity function is designed to measure the similarity between the feature pair, which is realized by learning a group of weight coefficients to project the element-wise absolute difference and multiplication into a similarity score. Consequently, the proposed DHSL method is able to reasonably assign parameters of feature learning and metric learning in a CNN so that the performance of person Re-ID is improved. Experiments on three challenging person Re-ID databases, QMUL GRID, VIPeR and CUHK03, illustrate that the proposed DHSL method is superior to multiple state-of-the-art person Re-ID methods.

人员重新识别（Re-ID）旨在匹配从两台不重叠的摄像机捕获的人员图像。本文提出了一种基于卷积神经网络（CNN）的人类Re-ID深度混合相似学习（DHSL）方法。在我们的方法中，同时提取输入图像对的CNN学习特征对。然后，计算CNN学习特征对的元素绝对差和乘法。最后，设计了一种混合相似度函数来度量特征对之间的相似度，通过学习一组权重系数来实现特征对之间的相似度，从而将元素间的绝对差异投影到一个相似度分数上。因此，所提出的DHSL方法能够合理地分配CNN中的特征学习和度量学习的参数，从而提高人Re-ID的性能。对三个具有挑战性的Re-ID数据库，QMUL GRID，VIPeR和CUHK03的实验表明，所提出的DHSL方法优于多个最先进的人Re-ID方法。
