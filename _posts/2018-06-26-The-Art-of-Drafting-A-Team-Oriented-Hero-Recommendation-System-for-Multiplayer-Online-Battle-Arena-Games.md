##### Abstract
Multiplayer Online Battle Arena (MOBA) games have received increasing popularity recently. In a match of such games, players compete in two teams of five, each controlling an in-game avatars, known as heroes, selected from a roster of more than 100. The selection of heroes, also known as pick or draft, takes place before the match starts and alternates between the two teams until each player has selected one hero. Heroes are designed with different strengths and weaknesses to promote team cooperation in a game. Intuitively, heroes in a strong team should complement each other's strengths and suppressing those of opponents. Hero drafting is therefore a challenging problem due to the complex hero-to-hero relationships to consider. In this paper, we propose a novel hero recommendation system that suggests heroes to add to an existing team while maximizing the team's prospect for victory. To that end, we model the drafting between two teams as a combinatorial game and use Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) for estimating the values of hero combinations. Our empirical evaluation shows that hero teams drafted by our recommendation algorithm have significantly higher win rate against teams constructed by other baseline and state-of-the-art strategies.

多人在线战斗竞技场（MOBA）游戏近来越来越受欢迎。在这样的比赛中，球员以两支五支球队的比赛进行比赛，每支球队控制一个名为英雄的游戏中的头像，从超过100人的名单中选出。选择英雄，也称为选秀或选秀，发生在比赛开始前，两队交替选择一名英雄。英雄的设计具有不同的优势和弱点，以促进游戏中的团队合作。直觉上，强壮的团队中的英雄应该互补对方的优势并压制对手的优势。因此英雄起草是一个具有挑战性的问题，因为需要考虑复杂的英雄与英雄之间的关系。在本文中，我们提出了一种新颖的英雄推荐系统，该系统建议英雄们加入现有团队，同时最大化团队的胜利前景。为此，我们将两个团队之间的起草模拟为组合游戏，并使用蒙特卡洛树搜索（MCTS）来估计英雄组合的值。我们的实证评估显示，根据我们的推荐算法起草的英雄团队对其他基线和最先进策略构建的团队的胜率显着较高。
