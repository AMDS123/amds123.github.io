##### Abstract
The supervisory control of probabilistic discrete event systems (PDESs) is investigated under the assumptions that the supervisory controller (supervisor) is probabilistic and has a partial observation. The probabilistic P-supervisor is defined, which specifies a probability distribution on the control patterns for each observation. The notions of the probabilistic controllability and observability are proposed and demonstrated to be a necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of the probabilistic P-supervisors. Moreover, the polynomial verification algorithms for the probabilistic controllability and observability are put forward. In addition, the infimal probabilistic controllable and observable superlanguage is introduced and computed as the solution of the optimal control problem of PDESs. Several examples are presented to illustrate the results obtained.

概率离散事件系统（PDESs）的监督控制是在监督控制者（主管）是概率性的并具有部分观察的假设下进行调查的。定义了概率P-supervisor，它为每个观察指定控制模式的概率分布。提出了概率可控性和可观测性的概念，并证明它是概率P监督者存在的必要和充分条件。并提出了概率可控性和可观测性的多项式验证算法。此外，引入和计算了最小概率可控可观测超语言作为PDES最优控制问题的解。介绍几个例子来说明所得结果。
