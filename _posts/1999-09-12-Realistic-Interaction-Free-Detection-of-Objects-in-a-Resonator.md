##### Abstract
We propose a realistic device for detecting objects almost without transferring a single quantum of energy to them. The device can work with an efficiency close to 100% and relies on two detectors counting both presence and absence of the objects. Its possible usage in performing fundamental experiments as well as possible applications are discussed.

我们提出了一种实际的探测物体的方法，几乎​​不需要将一定量的能量转移给它们。该设备能够以接近100％的效率工作，并依靠两个检测器来计算对象的存在和不存在。讨论了它在执行基本实验以及可能的应用中的可能用法。
