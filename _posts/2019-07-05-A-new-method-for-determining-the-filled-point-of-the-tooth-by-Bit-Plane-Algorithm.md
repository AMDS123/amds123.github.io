##### Abstract
Up to now, researchers have applied segmentation techniques in their studies on teeth images, with construction on tooth root length and depth. In this paper, a new approach to the exact identification of the filled points of the tooth is proposed. In this method, the filled teeth are detection by applying the Bit-Plane algorithm on the OPG images. The novelty of the proposed method is that we can use it in medicine for the detection of dental filling and we calculate and present the area of the filled points which may help dentists to assess the filled point of the tooth. The experimental results, confirmed by the dentists, clearly indicate that this method is able to separate the filled points from the rest of healthy teeth completely.
