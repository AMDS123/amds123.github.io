##### Abstract
We used the Ladder Network [Rasmus et al. (2015)] to perform Hyperspectral Image Classification in a semi-supervised setting. The Ladder Network distinguishes itself from other semi-supervised methods by jointly optimizing a supervised and unsupervised cost. In many settings this has proven to be more successful than other semi-supervised techniques, such as pretraining using unlabeled data. We furthermore show that the convolutional Ladder Network outperforms most of the current techniques used in hyperspectral image classification and achieves new state-of-the-art performance on the Pavia University dataset given only 5 labeled data points per class.
