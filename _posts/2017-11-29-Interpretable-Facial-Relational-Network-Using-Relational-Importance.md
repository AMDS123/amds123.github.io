##### Abstract
Human face analysis is an important task in computer vision. According to cognitive-psychological studies, facial dynamics could provide crucial cues for face analysis. In particular, the motion of facial local regions in facial expression is related to the motion of other facial regions. In this paper, a novel deep learning approach which exploits the relations of facial local dynamics has been proposed to estimate facial traits from expression sequence. In order to exploit the relations of facial dynamics in local regions, the proposed network consists of a facial local dynamic feature encoding network and a facial relational network. The facial relational network is designed to be interpretable. Relational importance is automatically encoded and facial traits are estimated by combining relational features based on the relational importance. The relations of facial dynamics for facial trait estimation could be interpreted by using the relational importance. By comparative experiments, the effectiveness of the proposed method has been validated. Experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in gender and age estimation.

人脸分析是计算机视觉中的一项重要任务。根据认知心理学研究，面部动态可以为面部分析提供重要线索。特别是面部局部区域在面部表情中的运动与其他面部区域的运动有关。本文提出了一种利用面部局部动力学关系的深度学习方法从表情序列中估计面部特征。为了充分利用局部人脸动态关系，提出了一种面部局部动态特征编码网络和人脸关系网络。面部关系网络被设计为可解释的。关系重要性被自动编码，通过结合关系重要性的关系特征来估计面部特征。面部特征估计的面部动力学关系可以用关系重要性来解释。通过对比实验，验证了所提方法的有效性。实验结果表明，所提出的方法在性别和年龄估计方面优于现有的方法。
