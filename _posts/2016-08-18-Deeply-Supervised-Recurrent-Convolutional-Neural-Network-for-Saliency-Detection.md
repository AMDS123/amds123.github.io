##### Abstract
This paper proposes a novel saliency detection method by developing a deeply-supervised recurrent convolutional neural network (DSRCNN), which performs a full image-to-image saliency prediction. For saliency detection, the local, global, and contextual information of salient objects is important to obtain a high quality salient map. To achieve this goal, the DSRCNN is designed based on VGGNet-16. Firstly, the recurrent connections are incorporated into each convolutional layer, which can make the model more powerful for learning the contextual information. Secondly, side-output layers are added to conduct the deeply-supervised operation, which can make the model learn more discriminative and robust features by effecting the intermediate layers. Finally, all of the side-outputs are fused to integrate the local and global information to get the final saliency detection results. Therefore, the DSRCNN combines the advantages of recurrent convolutional neural networks and deeply-supervised nets. The DSRCNN model is tested on five benchmark datasets, and experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art saliency detection approaches on all test datasets.

本文提出了一种新的显着性检测方法，通过开发一个深度监督的递归卷积神经网络（DSRCNN），执行完整的图像到图像显着性预测。对于显着性检测，显着物体的局部，全局和上下文信息对于获得高质量的显着图很重要。为了实现这个目标，DSRCNN是基于VGGNet-16设计的。首先，将循环连接纳入每个卷积层，这可以使模型更有效地学习上下文信息。其次，加入侧输出层进行深度监督操作，通过影响中间层可以使模型学习更具判别力和鲁棒性的特征。最后，将所有边输出进行融合，将局部和全局信息进行融合，得到最终的显着性检测结果。因此，DSRCNN结合了循环卷积神经网络和深度监督网络的优点。 DSRCNN模型在五个基准数据集上进行测试，实验结果表明，所提出的方法明显优于所有测试数据集上最先进的显着性检测方法。
