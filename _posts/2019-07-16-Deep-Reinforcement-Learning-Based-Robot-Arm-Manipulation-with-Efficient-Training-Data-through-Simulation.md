##### Abstract
Deep reinforcement learning trains neural networks using experiences sampled from the replay buffer, which is commonly updated at each time step. In this paper, we propose a method to update the replay buffer adaptively and selectively to train a robot arm to accomplish a suction task in simulation. The response time of the agent is thoroughly taken into account. The state transitions that remain stuck at the boundary of constraint are not stored. The policy trained with our method works better than the one with the common replay buffer update method. The result is demonstrated both by simulation and by experiment with a real robot arm.
