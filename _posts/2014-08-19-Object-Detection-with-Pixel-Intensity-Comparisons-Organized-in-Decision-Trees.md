##### Abstract
We describe a method for visual object detection based on an ensemble of optimized decision trees organized in a cascade of rejectors. The trees use pixel intensity comparisons in their internal nodes and this makes them able to process image regions very fast. Experimental analysis is provided through a face detection problem. The obtained results are encouraging and demonstrate that the method has practical value. Additionally, we analyse its sensitivity to noise and show how to perform fast rotation invariant object detection. Complete source code is provided at this https URL.
