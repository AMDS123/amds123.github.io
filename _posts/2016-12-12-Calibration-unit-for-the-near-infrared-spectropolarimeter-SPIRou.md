##### Abstract
SPIRou is a near-infrared spectropolarimeter and high precision radial velocity instrument, to be implemented at CFHT in end 2017. It focuses on the search for Earth-like planets around M dwarfs and on the study of stellar and planetary formation in the presence of stellar magnetic field. The calibration unit and the radial-velocity reference module are essential to the short- and long-term precision (1 m/s). We highlight the specificities in the calibration techniques compared to the spectrographs HARPS (at LaSilla, ESO) or SOPHIE (at OHP, France) due to the near-infrared wavelengths, the CMOS detectors, and the instrument design. We also describe the calibration unit architecture, design and production.
