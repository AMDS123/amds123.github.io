##### Abstract
Objective: Radiomics-driven Computer Aided Diagnosis (CAD) has shown considerable promise in recent years as a potential tool for improving clinical decision support in medical oncology, particularly those based around the concept of Discovery Radiomics, where radiomic sequencers are discovered through the analysis of medical imaging data. One of the main limitations with current CAD approaches is that it is very difficult to gain insight or rationale as to how decisions are made, thus limiting their utility to clinicians. Methods: In this study, we propose CLEAR-DR, a novel interpretable CAD system based on the notion of CLass-Enhanced Attentive Response Discovery Radiomics for the purpose of clinical decision support for diabetic retinopathy. Results: In addition to disease grading via the discovered deep radiomic sequencer, the CLEAR-DR system also produces a visual interpretation of the decision-making process to provide better insight and understanding into the decision-making process of the system. Conclusion: We demonstrate the effectiveness and utility of the proposed CLEAR-DR system of enhancing the interpretability of diagnostic grading results for the application of diabetic retinopathy grading. Significance: CLEAR-DR can act as a potential powerful tool to address the uninterpretability issue of current CAD systems, thus improving their utility to clinicians.

目的：近年来，放射组学驱动的计算机辅助诊断（CAD）已经显示出巨大的潜力，可作为改善医学肿瘤学临床决策支持的潜在工具，特别是基于发现放射学概念的那些，其中通过分析医学影像数据。目前的CAD方法的一个主要局限性是很难获得洞察力或理由来决定如何做出决定，从而限制了它们对临床医生的效用。方法：在本研究中，我们提出CLEAR-DR，一种基于CLass增强型注意反应发现放射学概念的新型可解释CAD系统，用于糖尿病视网膜病变的临床决策支持。结果：除了通过发现的深度放射性测序仪进行疾病分级外，CLEAR-DR系统还对决策过程进行了可视化解释，以便更好地了解和理解系统的决策过程。结论：我们证实了CLEAR-DR系统在提高糖尿病视网膜病变分级诊断分级结果可解释性方面的有效性和实用性。意义：CLEAR-DR可作为解决当前CAD系统不可解释问题的潜在强大工具，从而提高临床医生的实用性。
