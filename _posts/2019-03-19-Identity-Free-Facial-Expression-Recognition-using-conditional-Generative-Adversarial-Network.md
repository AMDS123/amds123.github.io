##### Abstract
In this paper, we proposed a novel Identity-free conditional Generative Adversarial Network (IF-GAN) to explicitly reduce inter-subject variations for facial expression recognition. Specifically, for any given input face image, a conditional generative model was developed to transform an average neutral face, which is calculated from various subjects showing neutral expressions, to an average expressive face with the same expression as the input image. Since the transformed images have the same synthetic "average" identity, they differ from each other by only their expressions and thus, can be used for identity-free expression classification. In this work, an end-to-end system was developed to perform expression transformation and expression recognition in the IF-GAN framework. Experimental results on three facial expression datasets have demonstrated that the proposed IF-GAN outperforms the baseline CNN model and achieves comparable or better performance compared with the state-of-the-art methods for facial expression recognition.
