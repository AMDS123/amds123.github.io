##### Abstract
While perception tasks such as visual object recognition and text understanding play an important role in human intelligence, the subsequent tasks that involve inference, reasoning and planning require an even higher level of intelligence. The past few years have seen major advances in many perception tasks using deep learning models. For higher-level inference, however, probabilistic graphical models with their Bayesian nature are still more powerful and flexible. To achieve integrated intelligence that involves both perception and inference, it is naturally desirable to tightly integrate deep learning and Bayesian models within a principled probabilistic framework, which we call Bayesian deep learning. In this unified framework, the perception of text or images using deep learning can boost the performance of higher-level inference and in return, the feedback from the inference process is able to enhance the perception of text or images. This paper proposes a general framework for Bayesian deep learning and reviews its recent applications on recommender systems, topic models, and control. In this paper, we also discuss the relationship and differences between Bayesian deep learning and other related topics like Bayesian treatment of neural networks.

##### Abstract (translated by Google)
虽然视觉对象识别和文本理解等感知任务在人的智能中起着重要作用，但涉及推理，推理和规划的后续任务需要更高水平的智能。在过去的几年中，使用深度学习模式在许多感知任务中取得了重大进展。然而，对于更高级的推理，具有贝叶斯性质的概率图模型仍然更加强大和灵活。为了实现既涉及感知又涉及推理的综合智能，将深度学习和贝叶斯模型紧密结合在一个原则性的概率框架（我们称之为贝叶斯深度学习）中是自然而然的。在这个统一的框架下，使用深度学习的文本或图像的感知可以提高高级推理的性能，反过来，推理过程的反馈能够增强文本或图像的感知。本文提出了贝叶斯深度学习的一般框架，并回顾了其在推荐系统，主题模型和控制方面的最新应用。在本文中，我们还讨论了贝叶斯深度学习和其他相关主题（如贝叶斯神经网络处理）之间的关系和差异。
