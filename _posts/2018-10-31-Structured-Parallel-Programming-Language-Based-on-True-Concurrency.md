##### Abstract
Based on our previous work on algebraic laws for true concurrency, we design a skeleton of structured parallel programming language for true concurrency called SPPLTC. Different to most programming languages, SPPLTC has an explicit parallel operator as an essential operator. SPPLTC can structure a truly concurrent graph to a normal form. This means that it is possible to implement a compiler for SPPLTC.
