##### Abstract
Fish in schooling formations navigate complex flow-fields replete with mechanical energy in the vortex wakes of their companions. Their schooling behaviour has been associated with evolutionary advantages including collective energy savings. How fish harvest energy from their complex fluid environment and the underlying physical mechanisms governing energy-extraction during collective swimming, is still unknown. Here we show that fish can improve their sustained propulsive efficiency by actively following, and judiciously intercepting, vortices in the wake of other swimmers. This swimming strategy leads to collective energy-savings and is revealed through the first ever combination of deep reinforcement learning with high-fidelity flow simulations. We find that a `smart-swimmer' can adapt its position and body deformation to synchronise with the momentum of the oncoming vortices, improving its average swimming-efficiency at no cost to the leader. The results show that fish may harvest energy deposited in vortices produced by their peers, and support the conjecture that swimming in formation is energetically advantageous. Moreover, this study demonstrates that deep reinforcement learning can produce navigation algorithms for complex flow-fields, with promising implications for energy savings in autonomous robotic swarms.

在学校形成的鱼类在复杂的流场中驾驶着充满机械能量的复杂流场，在同伴的旋涡中醒来。他们的学习行为与集体节能等进化优势有关。集体游泳过程中鱼类如何从复杂的流体环境中获取能量以及控制能量提取的潜在物理机制，目前尚不清楚。在这里我们表明，鱼可以提高其持续的推进效率，积极跟随，明智地拦截，其他游泳运动员之后的旋涡。这种游泳策略导致了集体节能，并通过深度强化学习与高保真流动模拟的首次结合来揭示。我们发现，一个“聪明的游泳者”可以调整自己的位置和身体变形，与迎面而来的旋涡的动力同步，从而提高其平均游泳效率，而不会对领导者造成任何损失。研究结果表明，鱼类可以收集同伴产生的旋涡中沉积的能量，支持游泳形成的能量有利的猜想。此外，这项研究表明深度强化学习可以产生复杂流场的导航算法，对于自主机器人群中的节能具有前景。
