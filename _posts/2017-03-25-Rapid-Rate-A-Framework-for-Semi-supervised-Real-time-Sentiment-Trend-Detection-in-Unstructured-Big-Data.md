##### Abstract
Commercial establishments like restaurants, service centres and retailers have several sources of customer feedback about products and services, most of which need not be as structured as rated reviews provided by services like Yelp, or Amazon, in terms of sentiment conveyed. For instance, Amazon provides a fine-grained score on a numeric scale for product reviews. Some sources, however, like social media (Twitter, Facebook), mailing lists (Google Groups) and forums (Quora) contain text data that is much more voluminous, but unstructured and unlabelled. It might be in the best interests of a business establishment to assess the general sentiment towards their brand on these platforms as well. This text could be pipelined into a system with a built-in prediction model, with the objective of generating real-time graphs on opinion and sentiment trends. Although such tasks like the one described about have been explored with respect to document classification problems in the past, the implementation described in this paper, by virtue of learning a continuous function rather than a discrete one, offers a lot more depth of insight as compared to document classification approaches. This study aims to explore the validity of such a continuous function predicting model to quantify sentiment about an entity, without the additional overhead of manual labelling, and computational preprocessing & feature extraction. This research project also aims to design and implement a re-usable document regression pipeline as a framework, Rapid-Rate, that can be used to predict document scores in real-time.

##### Abstract (translated by Google)
像餐馆，服务中心和零售商这样的商业机构有几个客户对产品和服务的反馈来源，其中大多数不需要像Yelp或亚马逊（Amazon）这样的服务提供的评级评论。例如，亚马逊在产品评论的数字尺度上提供了细致的评分。然而，有些消息来源，比如社交媒体（Twitter，Facebook），邮件列表（Google Groups）和论坛（Quora）包含的文本数据更多，但是非结构化和未标记的。在这些平台上评估对其品牌的一般情感也许符合商业机构的最佳利益。这个文本可以被流水线化为一个内置预测模型的系统，目的是生成意见和情绪趋势的实时图表。尽管过去的文档分类问题已经探讨过类似的任务，但是本文所描述的实现是通过学习一个连续的函数而不是离散的函数来提供更深入的洞察力归档分类方法。本研究旨在探索这种连续函数预测模型的有效性，以量化关于实体的情绪，而不需要额外的人工标记开销，以及计算预处理和特征提取。这个研究项目还旨在设计和实现一个可重用的文档回归流水线作为一个框架，Rapid-Rate，可以用来实时预测文档分数。
