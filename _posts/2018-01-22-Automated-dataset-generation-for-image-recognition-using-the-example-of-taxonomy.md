##### Abstract
This master thesis addresses the subject of automatically generating a dataset for image recognition, which takes a lot of time when being done manually. As the thesis was written with motivation from the context of the biodiversity workgroup at the City University of Applied Sciences Bremen, the classification of taxonomic entries was chosen as an exemplary use case. In order to automate the dataset creation, a prototype was conceptualized and implemented after working out knowledge basics and analyzing requirements for it. It makes use of an pre-trained abstract artificial intelligence which is able to sort out images that do not contain the desired content. Subsequent to the implementation and the automated dataset creation resulting from it, an evaluation was performed. Other, manually collected datasets were compared to the one the prototype produced in means of specifications and accuracy. The results were more than satisfactory and showed that automatically generating a dataset for image recognition is not only possible, but also might be a decent alternative to spending time and money in doing this task manually. At the very end of this work, an idea of how to use the principle of employing abstract artificial intelligences for step-by-step classification of deeper taxonomic layers in a productive system is presented and discussed.

##### Abstract (translated by Google)
本硕士论文针对自动生成图像识别数据集的主题，手动完成时花费大量时间。由于论文是在不来梅应用科学大学生物多样性工作组的背景下编写的，分类学入门的分类被选为一个典型的使用案例。为了实现数据集创建的自动化，在制定了知识基础和分析需求之后，对原型进行了概念化和实现。它利用预先训练的抽象人工智能，能够整理不包含所需内容的图像。在实施之后以及由此产生的自动数据集创建之后，进行评估。其他手动收集的数据集与规范和准确性所产生的原型进行比较。结果令人比较满意，并且显示自动生成用于图像识别的数据集不仅是可能的，而且可能是花费时间和金钱手动完成这项任务的体面的替代方案。在这项工作的最后，提出并讨论了如何使用抽象人工智能的原理来逐步分类生产系统中更深层次的分类层的想法。
