##### Abstract
Single photon emission was observed from site-controlled InGaN/GaN quantum dots. The single-photon nature of the emission was verified by the second-order correlation function up to 90 K, the highest temperature to date for site-controlled quantum dots. Micro-photoluminescence study on individual quantum dots showed linearly polarized single exciton emission with a lifetime of a few nanoseconds. The dimensions of these quantum dots were well controlled to the precision of state-of-the-art fabrication technologies, as reflected in the uniformity of their optical properties. The yield of optically active quantum dots was greater than 90%, among which 13%-25% exhibited single photon emission at 10 K.

从位置控制的InGaN / GaN量子点观察单光子发射。发射的单光子性质通过高达90K的二阶相关函数来证实，这是迄今为止用于现场控制的量子点的最高温度。单个量子点的微光致发光研究表明，线性极化单激子发射寿命为几纳秒。这些量子点的尺寸可以很好地控制在最先进的制造技术的精度之中，正如其光学特性的一致性所反映的那样。光学活性量子点的产率大于90％，其中13％〜25％在10K时表现出单光子发射。
