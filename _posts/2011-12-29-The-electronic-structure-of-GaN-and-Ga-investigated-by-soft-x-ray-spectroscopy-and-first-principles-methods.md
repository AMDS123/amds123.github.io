##### Abstract
The electronic structure and chemical bonding of wurtzite-GaN investigated by N 1s soft x-ray absorption spectroscopy and N K, Ga M1, and Ga M2,3 emission spectroscopy is compared to that of pure Ga. The measurements are interpreted by calculated spectra using first-principles density-functional theory (DFT) including dipole transition matrix elements and additional on-site Coulomb interaction (WC-GGA+U). The Ga 4p - N 2p and Ga 4s - N 2p hybridization and chemical bond regions are identified at the top of the valence band between -1.0 and -2.0 and further down between -5.5 and -6.5 eV, respectively. In addition, N 2s - N 2p - Ga 4s and N 2s - N 2p - Ga 3d hybridization regions occur at the bottom of the valence band between -13 and -15 eV, and between -17.0 and -18.0 eV, respectively. A band-like satellite feature is also found around -10 eV in the Ga M1 and Ga M2,3 emission from GaN, but is absent in pure Ga and the calculated ground state spectra. The difference between the identified spectroscopic features of GaN and Ga are discussed in relation to the various hybridization regions calculated within band-structure methods.

通过N 1s软x射线吸收光谱和NK，Ga M1和Ga M2.3发射光谱研究了纤锌矿GaN的电子结构和化学键，并与纯Ga进行了比较。原子密度泛函理论（DFT）包括偶极子转换矩阵元素和额外的现场库仑相互作用（WC-GGA + U）。 Ga 4p  -  N 2p和Ga 4s  -  N 2p杂化和化学键区位于-1.0和-2.0之间的价带顶部，并进一步分别在-5.5和-6.5 eV之间。此外，N 2s  -  N 2p  -  Ga 4s和N 2s  -  N 2p  -  Ga 3d杂交区域分别出现在价带的-13和-15 eV之间，以及-17.0和-18.0 eV之间。在GaN的Ga M1和Ga M2,3发射中，在-10eV附近也发现带状卫星特征，但是在纯Ga和计算的基态光谱中不存在带状卫星特征。讨论了GaN和Ga的识别光谱特征之间的区别，涉及在带结构方法中计算的各种杂交区域。
