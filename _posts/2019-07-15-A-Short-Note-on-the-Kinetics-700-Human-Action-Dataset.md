##### Abstract
We describe an extension of the DeepMind Kinetics human action dataset from 600 classes to 700 classes, where for each class there are at least 600 video clips from different YouTube videos. This paper details the changes introduced for this new release of the dataset, and includes a comprehensive set of statistics as well as baseline results using the I3D neural network architecture.
