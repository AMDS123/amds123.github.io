##### Abstract
While it is relatively easy to start an online advertising campaign, obtaining a high Key Performance Indicator (KPI) can be challenging. A large body of work on this subject has already been performed and platforms known as DSPs are available on the market that deal with such an optimization. From the advertiser's point of view, each DSP is a different black box, with its pros and cons, that needs to be configured. In order to take advantage of the pros of every DSP, advertisers are well-advised to use a combination of them when setting up their campaigns. In this paper, we propose an algorithm for advertisers to add an optimization layer on top of DSPs. The algorithm we introduce, called SKOTT, maximizes the chosen KPI by optimally configuring the DSPs and putting them in competition with each other. SKOTT is a highly specialized iterative algorithm loosely based on gradient descent that is made up of three independent sub-routines, each dealing with a different problem: partitioning the budget, setting the desired average bid, and preventing under-delivery. In particular, one of the novelties of our approach lies in our taking the perspective of the advertisers rather than the DSPs. Synthetic market data is used to evaluate the efficiency of SKOTT against other state-of-the-art approaches adapted from similar problems. The results illustrate the benefits of our proposals, which greatly outperforms the other methods.

虽然开展在线广告活动相对容易，但获得高关键绩效指标（KPI）可能具有挑战性。关于这一主题的大量工作已经完成，市场上有称为DSP的平台可以处理这种优化。从广告商的角度来看，每个DSP都是一个不同的黑盒子，其优缺点需要配置。为了充分利用每个DSP的优势，建议广告客户在设置广告系列时使用它们的组合。在本文中，我们为广告商提出了一种在DSP之上添加优化层的算法。我们引入的算法称为SKOTT，通过优化配置DSP并使它们相互竞争，最大化所选择的KPI。 SKOTT是一种高度专业化的迭代算法，基于梯度下降，由三个独立的子程序组成，每个子程序处理一个不同的问题：划分预算，设置所需的平均出价，以及防止交付不足。特别是，我们的方法的一个新颖之处在于我们采用广告商的视角而不是DSP。合成市场数据用于评估SKOTT对其他适用于类似问题的最先进方法的效率。结果说明了我们的建议的好处，这些建议大大优于其他方法。
