##### Abstract
This paper employs case-based reasoning (CBR) to capture the personal styles of individual artists and generate the human facial portraits from photos accordingly. For each human artist to be mimicked, a series of cases are firstly built-up from her/his exemplars of source facial photo and hand-drawn sketch, and then its stylization for facial photo is transformed as a style-transferring process of iterative refinement by looking-for and applying best-fit cases in a sense of style optimization. Two models, fitness evaluation model and parameter estimation model, are learned for case retrieval and adaptation respectively from these cases. The fitness evaluation model is to decide which case is best-fitted to the sketching of current interest, and the parameter estimation model is to automate case adaptation. The resultant sketch is synthesized progressively with an iterative loop of retrieval and adaptation of candidate cases until the desired aesthetic style is achieved. To explore the effectiveness and advantages of the novel approach, we experimentally compare the sketch portraits generated by the proposed method with that of a state-of-the-art example-based facial sketch generation algorithm as well as a couple commercial software packages. The comparisons reveal that our CBR based synthesis method for facial portraits is superior both in capturing and reproducing artists' personal illustration styles to the peer methods.

本文采用基于案例推理（CBR）来捕捉个体艺术家的个人风格，并相应地从照片中生成人脸照片。对于每一个被模仿的人类艺术家，首先从她/他的源头面部照片和手绘素描的样本中构建一系列的案例，然后将其面部照片的程式化转化为迭代求精的风格转移过程通过寻找和应用风格优化意义上的最合适的案例。从这些案例中分别学习案例检索和适应两个模型，适应度评估模型和参数估计模型。适应性评估模型是决定哪个案例最适合当前兴趣的草图，参数估计模型是自动化案例适应。由此产生的草图逐步合成，对候选案例进行反复和循环的迭代循环，直到达到所需的美学风格。为了探索这种新方法的有效性和优点，我们通过实验比较了所提出的方法生成的素描肖像与最先进的基于范例的面部素描生成算法以及一对商业软件包。这些比较表明，我们基于CBR的脸部肖像合成方法在捕捉和再现艺术家的个人插图风格方面优于对等方法。
