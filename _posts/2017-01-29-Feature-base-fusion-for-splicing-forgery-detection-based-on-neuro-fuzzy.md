##### Abstract
Most of researches on image forensics have been mainly focused on detection of artifacts introduced by a single processing tool. They lead in the development of many specialized algorithms looking for one or more particular footprints under specific settings. Naturally, the performance of such algorithms are not perfect, and accordingly the provided output might be noisy, inaccurate and only partially correct. Furthermore, a forged image in practical scenarios is often the result of utilizing several tools available by image-processing software systems. Therefore, reliable tamper detection requires developing more poweful tools to deal with various tempering scenarios. Fusion of forgery detection tools based on Fuzzy Inference System has been used before for addressing this problem. Adjusting the membership functions and defining proper fuzzy rules for attaining to better results are time-consuming processes. This can be accounted as main disadvantage of fuzzy inference systems. In this paper, a Neuro-Fuzzy inference system for fusion of forgery detection tools is developed. The neural network characteristic of these systems provides appropriate tool for automatically adjusting the membership functions. Moreover, initial fuzzy inference system is generated based on fuzzy clustering techniques. The proposed framework is implemented and validated on a benchmark image splicing data set in which three forgery detection tools are fused based on adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy inference system. The outcome of the proposed method reveals that applying Neuro Fuzzy inference systems could be a better approach for fusion of forgery detection tools.

大多数图像取证研究主要集中在单个处理工具引入的伪像检测上。他们在许多专用算法的开发中处于领先地位，在特定的设置下寻找一个或多个特定的脚印。自然，这样的算法的性能并不完美，因此提供的输出可能是嘈杂的，不准确的，只是部分正确的。此外，实际场景中的伪造图像通常是利用图像处理软件系统提供的多种工具的结果。因此，可靠的篡改检测需要开发更多功能强大的工具来处理各种调试情况。之前已经使用基于模糊推理系统的伪造检测工具的融合来解决这个问题。调整隶属函数和定义适当的模糊规则以获得更好的结果是耗时的过程。这可以被认为是模糊推理系统的主要缺点。本文建立了伪造检测工具融合的神经模糊推理系统。这些系统的神经网络特征为自动调整隶属函数提供了适当的工具。此外，基于模糊聚类技术生成初始模糊推理系统。提出的框架在基于自适应Neuro-Fuzzy推理系统的基准图像拼接数据集上实现并验证，其中三个伪造检测工具被融合。提出的方法的结果表明，应用神经模糊推理系统可能是一个更好的方法融合伪造检测工具。
