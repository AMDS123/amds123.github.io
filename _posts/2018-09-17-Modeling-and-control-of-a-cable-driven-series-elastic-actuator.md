##### Abstract
Series elastic actuators (SEA) are playing an increasingly important role in the fields of physical human-robot interaction. This paper focuses on the modeling and control of a cable-driven SEA. First, the scheme of the cable-driven SEA has been proposed, and a velocity controlled DC motor has been used as its power source. Based on this, the model of the cable-driven SEA has been built up. Further, a two degrees of freedom (2-DOF) control approach has been employed to control the output torque. Simulation results have shown that the 2-DOF method has achieved better robust performance than the PD method.

系列弹性致动器（SEA）在物理人机交互领域发挥着越来越重要的作用。本文重点介绍了电缆驱动的SEA的建模和控制。首先，已经提出了电缆驱动的SEA的方案，并且已经使用速度控制的DC电动机作为其电源。在此基础上，建立了电缆驱动的SEA模型。此外，采用两个自由度（2-DOF）控制方法来控制输出扭矩。仿真结果表明，2-DOF方法比PD方法具有更好的鲁棒性能。
