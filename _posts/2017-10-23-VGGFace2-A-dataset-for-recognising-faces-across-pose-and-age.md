##### Abstract
In this paper, we introduce a new large-scale face dataset named VGGFace2. The dataset contains 3.31 million images of 9131 subjects, with an average of 362.6 images for each subject. Images are downloaded from Google Image Search and have large variations in pose, age, illumination, ethnicity and profession (e.g. actors, athletes, politicians). The dataset was collected with three goals in mind: (i) to have both a large number of identities and also a large number of images for each identity; (ii) to cover a large range of pose, age and ethnicity; and (iii) to minimize the label noise. We describe how the dataset was collected, in particular the automated and manual filtering stages to ensure a high accuracy for the images of each identity. To assess face recognition performance using the new dataset, we train ResNet-50 (with and without Squeeze-and-Excitation blocks) Convolutional Neural Networks on VGGFace2, on MS- Celeb-1M, and on their union, and show that training on VGGFace2 leads to improved recognition performance over pose and age. Finally, using the models trained on these datasets, we demonstrate state-of-the-art performance on the IJB-A and IJB-B face recognition benchmarks, exceeding the previous state-of-the-art by a large margin. Datasets and models are publicly available.

在本文中，我们引入一个名为VGGFace2的新的大型人脸数据集。数据集包含9131个科目的313万图像，平均每个科目362.6个图像。从Google图片搜索下载图片，姿势，年龄，照明，种族和职业（如演员，运动员，政治家）有很大的差异。数据集的收集有三个目标：（i）每个身份都有大量的身份和大量的图像; （ii）涵盖大范围的姿势，年龄和种族;和（iii）最小化标签噪音。我们描述如何收集数据集，特别是自动和手动过滤阶段，以确保每个身份的图像的高准确性。为了评估使用新数据集的人脸识别性能，我们在VGGFace2和MS-Celeb-1M上训练了ResNet-50（有和没有挤压和激励模块）卷积神经网络，并且证明了对VGGFace2导致相对于姿势和年龄的识别性能提高。最后，利用这些数据集训练的模型，我们在IJB-A和IJB-B人脸识别基准上展示了最先进的性能，大大超过了先前的技术水平。数据集和模型是公开的。
