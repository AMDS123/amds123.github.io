##### Abstract
Long-range correlation, a property of time series exhibiting long-term memory, is mainly studied in the statistical physics domain and has been reported to exist in natural language. Using a state-of-the-art method for such analysis, long-range correlation is first shown to occur in long CHILDES data sets. To understand why, Bayesian generative models of language, originally proposed in the cognitive scientific domain, are investigated. Among representative models, the Simon model was found to exhibit surprisingly good long-range correlation, but not the Pitman-Yor model. Since the Simon model is known not to correctly reflect the vocabulary growth of natural language, a simple new model is devised as a conjunct of the Simon and Pitman-Yor models, such that long-range correlation holds with a correct vocabulary growth rate. The investigation overall suggests that uniform sampling is one cause of long-range correlation and could thus have a relation with actual linguistic processes.

长期相关性是表现长期记忆的时间序列性质，主要在统计物理学领域进行研究，并被报道以自然语言存在。使用最先进的方法进行这种分析，远距离相关首先显示在长CHILDES数据集中。为了理解为什么，研究了最初在认知科学领域提出的贝叶斯生成语言模型。在代表性模型中，Simon模型被发现表现出惊人的长程相关性，但不是Pitman-Yor模型。由于Simon模型已知不能正确反映自然语言的词汇增长，所以设计一个简单的新模型作为Simon和Pitman-Yor模型的一个结合体，这样长期的相关性就能保持正确的词汇增长率。整体调查表明，均匀抽样是长程相关性的一个原因，因此可能与实际的语言过程有关。
