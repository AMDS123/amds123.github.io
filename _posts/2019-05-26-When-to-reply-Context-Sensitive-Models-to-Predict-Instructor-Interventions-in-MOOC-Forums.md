##### Abstract
Due to time constraints, course instructors often need to selectively participate in student discussion threads, due to their limited bandwidth and lopsided student--instructor ratio on online forums. We propose the first deep learning models for this binary prediction problem. We propose novel attention based models to infer the amount of latent context necessary to predict instructor intervention. Such models also allow themselves to be tuned to instructor's preference to intervene early or late. Our three proposed attentive model variants to infer the latent context improve over the state-of-the-art by a significant, large margin of 11% in F1 and 10% in recall, on average. Further, introspection of attention help us better understand what aspects of a discussion post propagate through the discussion thread that prompts instructor intervention.
