##### Abstract
This paper aims to question the suitability of the Turing Test, for testing machine intelligence, in the light of advances made in the last 60 years in science, medicine, and philosophy of mind. While the main concept of the test may seem sound and valid, a detailed analysis of what is required to pass the test highlights a significant flow. Once the analysis of the test is presented, a systematic approach is followed in analysing what is needed to devise a test or tests for intelligent machines. The paper presents a plausible generic framework based on categories of factors implied by subjective perception of intelligence. An evaluative discussion concludes the paper highlighting some of the unaddressed issues within this generic framework.
