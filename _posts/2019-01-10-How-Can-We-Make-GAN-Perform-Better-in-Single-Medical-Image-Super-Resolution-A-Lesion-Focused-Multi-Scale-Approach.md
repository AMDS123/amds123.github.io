##### Abstract
Single image super-resolution (SISR) is of great importance as a low-level computer vision task. The fast development of Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) based deep learning architectures realises an efficient and effective SISR to boost the spatial resolution of natural images captured by digital cameras. However, the SISR for medical images is still a very challenging problem. This is due to (1) compared to natural images, in general, medical images have lower signal to noise ratios, (2) GAN based models pre-trained on natural images may synthesise unrealistic patterns in medical images which could affect the clinical interpretation and diagnosis, and (3) the vanilla GAN architecture may suffer from unstable training and collapse mode that can also affect the SISR results. In this paper, we propose a novel lesion focused SR (LFSR) method, which incorporates GAN to achieve perceptually realistic SISR results for brain tumour MRI images. More importantly, we test and make comparison using recently developed GAN variations, e.g., Wasserstein GAN (WGAN) and WGAN with Gradient Penalty (WGAN-GP), and propose a novel multi-scale GAN (MS-GAN), to achieve a more stabilised and efficient training and improved perceptual quality of the super-resolved results. Based on both quantitative evaluations and our designed mean opinion score, the proposed LFSR coupled with MS-GAN has performed better in terms of both perceptual quality and efficiency.
