##### Abstract
Tensor-based methods have recently emerged as a more natural and effective formulation to address many problems in hyperspectral imaging. In hyperspectral unmixing (HU), low-rank constraints on the abundance maps have been shown to act as a regularization which adequately accounts for the multidimensional structure of the underlying signal. However, imposing a strict low-rank constraint for the abundance maps does not seem to be adequate, as important information that may be required to represent fine scale abundance behavior may be discarded. This paper introduces a new low-rank tensor regularization that adequately captures the low-rank structure underlying the abundance maps without hindering the flexibility of the solution. Simulation results with synthetic and real data show that the the extra flexibility introduced by the proposed regularization significantly improves the unmixing results.

##### Abstract (translated by Google)
最近出现了基于张量的方法作为解决高光谱成像中许多问题的更自然和有效的公式。在高光谱分解（HU）中，丰度图上的低秩约束已被证明充当正则化，充分考虑了基础信号的多维结构。然而，对丰度图施加严格的低秩约束似乎并不充分，因为可能需要用于表示精细等级丰度行为的重要信息可能被丢弃。本文介绍了一种新的低秩张量正则化方法，该方法能充分捕获丰度图下的低阶结构，而不会影响解的灵活性。利用合成和真实数据的仿真结果表明，所提出的正则化所引入的额外的灵活性显着地提高了解混结果。
