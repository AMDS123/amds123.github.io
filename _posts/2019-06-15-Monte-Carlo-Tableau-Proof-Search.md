##### Abstract
We study Monte Carlo Tree Search to guide proof search in tableau calculi. This includes proposing a number of proof-state evaluation heuristics, some of which are learnt from previous proofs. We present an implementation based on the leanCoP prover. The system is trained and evaluated on a large suite of related problems coming from the Mizar proof assistant, showing that it is capable to find new and different proofs.
