##### Abstract
Neural networks are commonly regarded as black boxes performing incomprehensible functions. For classification problems networks provide maps from high dimensional feature space to K-dimensional image space. Images of training vector are projected on polygon vertices, providing visualization of network function. Such visualization may show the dynamics of learning, allow for comparison of different networks, display training vectors around which potential problems may arise, show differences due to regularization and optimization procedures, investigate stability of network classification under perturbation of original vectors, and place new data sample in relation to training data, allowing for estimation of confidence in classification of a given sample. An illustrative example for the three-class Wine data and five-class Satimage data is described. The visualization method proposed here is applicable to any black box system that provides continuous outputs.

神经网络通常被认为是执行不可理解功能的黑盒子。对于分类问题，网络提供从高维特征空间到K维图像空间的映射。训练矢量的图像投影在多边形顶点上，提供网络功能的可视化。这种可视化可以显示学习的动态，允许比较不同的网络，显示可能出现潜在问题的训练矢量，显示由于正则化和优化程序引起的差异，调查在原始矢量扰动下网络分类的稳定性，以及放置新数据与训练数据相关的样本，允许估计给定样本的分类置信度。描述了三类Wine数据和五类Satimage数据的说明性示例。这里提出的可视化方法适用于任何提供连续输出的黑匣子系统。
