##### Abstract
As neural networks have dominated the state-of-the-art results in a wide range of NLP tasks, it attracts considerable attention to improve the performance of neural models by integrating symbolic knowledge. Different from existing works, this paper investigates the combination of these two powerful paradigms from the knowledge-driven side. We propose Neural Rule Engine (NRE), which can learn knowledge explicitly from logic rules and then generalize them implicitly with neural networks. NRE is implemented with neural module networks in which each module represents an action of a logic rule. The experiments show that NRE could greatly improve the generalization abilities of logic rules with a significant increase in recall. Meanwhile, the precision is still maintained at a high level.
