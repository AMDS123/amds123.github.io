##### Abstract
This paper presents results on Speaker Recognition (SR) for children's speech, using the OGI Kids corpus and GMM-UBM and GMM-SVM SR systems. Regions of the spectrum containing important speaker information for children are identified by conducting SR experiments over 21 frequency bands. As for adults, the spectrum can be split into four regions, with the first (containing primary vocal tract resonance information) and third (corresponding to high frequency speech sounds) being most useful for SR. However, the frequencies at which these regions occur are from 11% to 38% higher for children. It is also noted that subband SR rates are lower for younger children. Finally results are presented of SR experiments to identify a child in a class (30 children, similar age) and school (288 children, varying ages). Class performance depends on age, with accuracy varying from 90% for young children to 99% for older children. The identification rate achieved for a child in a school is 81%.

本文使用OGI Kids语料库，GMM-UBM和GMM-SVM SR系统，提出了说话人识别（SR）的儿童言语结果。通过对21个频段进行SR实验，确定包含儿童重要说话人信息的频谱区域。对于成年人而言，频谱可以分为四个区域，第一个（包含主要声道共振信息）和第三个（对应于高频语音）对SR最有用。然而，这些地区发生的频率比儿童高出11％到38％。还有人指出，年龄较小的儿童的子带SR率较低。最后给出了SR实验的结果，以确定一个班（30个孩子，相似的年龄）和学校（288个孩子，不同年龄）的孩子。课堂表现取决于年龄，准确率从幼儿90％到大龄儿童99％不等。一所学校的孩子识别率为81％。
