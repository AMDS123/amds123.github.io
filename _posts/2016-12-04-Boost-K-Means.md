##### Abstract
Due to its simplicity and versatility, k-means remains popular since it was proposed three decades ago. The performance of k-means has been enhanced from different perspectives over the years. Unfortunately, a good trade-off between quality and efficiency is hardly reached. In this paper, a novel k-means variant is presented. Different from most of k-means variants, the clustering procedure is driven by an explicit objective function, which is feasible for the whole l2-space. The classic egg-chicken loop in k-means has been simplified to a pure stochastic optimization procedure. The procedure of k-means becomes simpler and converges to a considerably better local optima. The effectiveness of this new variant has been studied extensively in different contexts, such as document clustering, nearest neighbor search and image clustering. Superior performance is observed across different scenarios.

由于其简单性和多功能性，k-means从三十年前被提出以来一直流行。 K-means的表现多年来从不同的角度出发。不幸的是，质量和效率之间的一个很好的折衷很难达到。本文提出了一种新的k-means变体。与大多数k-means变体不同，聚类过程是由一个明确的目标函数驱动的，这对于整个l2空间是可行的。 k-means中经典的鸡蛋鸡圈已经简化为纯粹的随机优化程序。 k-means的过程变得更简单，收敛到一个相当好的局部最优解。这个新变种的有效性已经在不同的背景下进行了广泛的研究，如文档聚类，最近邻搜索和图像聚类。在不同的情况下观察到卓越的性能。
