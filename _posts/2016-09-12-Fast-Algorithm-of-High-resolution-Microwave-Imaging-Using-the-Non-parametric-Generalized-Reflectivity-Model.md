##### Abstract
This paper presents an efficient algorithm of high-resolution microwave imaging based on the concept of generalized reflectivity. The contribution made in this paper is two-fold. We introduce the concept of non-parametric generalized reflectivity (GR, for short) as a function of operational frequencies and view angles, etc. The GR extends the conventional Born-based imaging model, i.e., single-scattering model, into that accounting for more realistic interaction between the electromagnetic wavefield and imaged scene. Afterwards, the GR-based microwave imaging is formulated in the convex of sparsity-regularized optimization. Typically, the sparsity-regularized optimization requires the implementation of iterative strategy, which is computationally expensive, especially for large-scale problems. To break this bottleneck, we convert the imaging problem into the problem of physics-driven image processing by introducing a dual transformation. Moreover, this image processing is performed over overlapping patches, which can be efficiently solved in the parallel or distributed manner. In this way, the proposed high-resolution imaging methodology could be applicable to large-scale microwave imaging problems. Selected simulation results are provided to demonstrate the state-of-art performance of proposed methodology.

##### Abstract (translated by Google)
本文提出了一种基于广义反射率概念的高分辨率微波成像算法。本文做出的贡献是双重的。我们引入非参数广义反射率（GR）的概念，作为运行频率和视角的函数等。GR将传统的基于Born的成像模型（即单散射模型）扩展到对电磁波场与成像场景之间更真实的相互作用。之后，基于GR的微波成像被制定在稀疏正则化优化的凸面中。通常，稀疏正则化优化需要实施迭代策略，这在计算上是昂贵的，特别是对于大规模问题。为了突破这一瓶颈，我们将成像问题转化为物理驱动的图像处理问题，引入双重变换。而且，这个图像处理是通过重叠的补丁来执行的，这可以以并行或者分布的方式被有效地解决。这样，所提出的高分辨率成像方法可适用于大规模微波成像问题。提供选定的模拟结果来展示所提出的方法的最新性能。
