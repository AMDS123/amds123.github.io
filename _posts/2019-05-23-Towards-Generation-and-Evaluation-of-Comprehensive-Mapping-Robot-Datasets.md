##### Abstract
This paper presents a fully hardware synchronized mapping robot with support for a hardware synchronized external tracking system, for super-precise timing and localization. We also employ a professional, static 3D scanner for ground truth map collection. Three datasets are generated to evaluate the performance of mapping algorithms within a room and between rooms. Based on these datasets we generate maps and trajectory data, which is then fed into evaluation algorithms. The mapping and evaluation procedures are made in a very easily reproducible manner for maximum comparability. In the end we can draw a couple of conclusions about the tested SLAM algorithms.
