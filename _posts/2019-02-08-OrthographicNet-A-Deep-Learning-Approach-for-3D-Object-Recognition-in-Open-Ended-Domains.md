##### Abstract
Service robots are expected to be more autonomous and efficiently work in human-centric environments. For this type of robots, open-ended object recognition is a challenging task due to the high demand for two essential capabilities: (i) the accurate and real-time response, and (ii) the ability to learn new object categories from very few examples on-site. These capabilities are required for such robots since no matter how extensive the training data used for batch learning, the robot might be faced with an unknown object when operating in everyday environments. In this work, we present OrthographicNet, a deep transfer learning based approach, for 3D object recognition in open-ended domains. In particular, OrthographicNet generates a rotation and scale invariant global feature for a given object, enabling to recognize the same or similar objects seen from different perspectives. Experimental results show that our approach yields significant improvements over the previous state-of-the-art approaches concerning scalability, memory usage, and object recognition performance. Regarding real-time performance, two real-world demonstrations validate the promising performance of the proposed architecture. Moreover, our approach demonstrates the capability of learning from very few training examples in a real-world setting.
