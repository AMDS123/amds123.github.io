##### Abstract
Several image pattern recognition tasks rely on superpixel generation as a fundamental step. Image analysis based on superpixels facilitates domain-specific applications, also speeding up the overall processing time of the task. Recent superpixel methods have been designed to fit boundary adherence, usually regulating the size and shape of each superpixel in order to mitigate the occurrence of undersegmentation failures. Superpixel regularity and compactness sometimes imposes an excessive number of segments in the image, which ultimately decreases the efficiency of the final segmentation, specially in video segmentation. We propose here a novel method to generate superpixels, called iterative over-segmentation via edge clustering (ISEC), which addresses the over-segmentation problem from a different perspective in contrast to recent state-of-the-art approaches. ISEC iteratively clusters edges extracted from the image objects, providing adaptive superpixels in size, shape and quantity, while preserving suitable adherence to the real object boundaries. All this is achieved at a very low computational cost. Experiments show that ISEC stands out from existing methods, meeting a favorable balance between segmentation stability and accurate representation of motion discontinuities, which are features specially suitable to video segmentation.

几个图像模式识别任务依赖超像素生成作为基本步骤。基于超像素的图像分析方便了特定于领域的应用程序，同时也加快了整个任务的处理时间。最近的超像素方法已被设计为适合边界粘附，通常调节每个超像素的尺寸和形状以减少欠成形失败的发生。超像素的规则性和紧凑性有时在图像中施加了过多的片段，这最终降低了最终分割的效率，特别是在视频分割中。我们在这里提出了一种新方法来生成超像素，称为迭代过度分割通过边缘聚类（ISEC），从不同的角度解决过度分割问题，而不是最近的最先进的方法。 ISEC迭代地对从图像对象中提取的边缘进行聚类，提供大小，形状和数量的自适应超像素，同时保持对真实物体边界的适当粘附。所有这些都以非常低的计算成本实现。实验表明，ISEC从现有方法中脱颖而出，在分割稳定性和精确表示运动不连续性之间取得良好的平衡，这是特别适合于视频分割的特征。
