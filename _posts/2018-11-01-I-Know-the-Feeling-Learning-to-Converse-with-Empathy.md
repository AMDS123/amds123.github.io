##### Abstract
Beyond understanding what is being discussed, human communication requires an awareness of what someone is feeling. One challenge for dialogue agents is being able to recognize feelings in the conversation partner and reply accordingly, a key communicative skill that is trivial for humans. Research in this area is made difficult by the paucity of large-scale publicly available datasets both for emotion and relevant dialogues. This work proposes a new task for empathetic dialogue generation and EmpatheticDialogues, a dataset of 25k conversations grounded in emotional contexts to facilitate training and evaluating dialogue systems. Our experiments indicate that models explicitly leveraging emotion predictions from previous utterances are perceived to be more empathetic by human evaluators, while improving on other metrics as well (e.g. perceived relevance of responses, BLEU scores).
