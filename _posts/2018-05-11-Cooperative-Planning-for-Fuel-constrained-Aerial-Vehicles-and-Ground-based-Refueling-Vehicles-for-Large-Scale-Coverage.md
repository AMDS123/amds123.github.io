##### Abstract
Low cost Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) need multiple refuels to accomplish large area coverage. The number of refueling stations and their placement plays a vital role in determining coverage efficiency. In this paper, we propose the use of a ground-based refueling vehicle (RV) to increase the operational range of a UAV in both spatial and temporal domains. Determining optimal routes for the UAV and RV, and selecting optimized locations for refueling to aid in minimizing coverage time is a challenging problem due to different vehicle speeds, coupling between refueling location placement, and the coverage area at each location. We develop a two-stage strategy for coupled route planning for UAV and RV to perform a coverage mission. The first stage computes a minimal set of refueling sites that permit a feasible UAV route. In the second stage, multiple Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP) formulations are developed to plan optimal routes for the UAV and the refueling vehicle taking into account the feasible set of refueling sites generated in stage one. The performance of different formulations is compared empirically. In addition, computationally efficient heuristics are developed to solve the routing problem. Extensive simulations are conducted to corroborate the effectiveness of proposed approaches.

低成本无人机（UAV）需要多种加油才能实现大面积覆盖。加油站的数量及其位置对确定覆盖效率起着至关重要的作用。在本文中，我们提出使用基于地面的加油车（RV）来增加无人机在空间和时间范围内的作战范围。确定无人机和房车的最佳路线，并选择加油的优化位置以帮助最大限度地缩短覆盖时间，这是一个具有挑战性的问题，因为不同的车辆速度，加油点位置和每个位置的覆盖区域之间的耦合。我们针对无人机和房车的联合航路规划制定了两阶段策略来执行覆盖任务。第一阶段计算允许可行的无人机路线的最小的一组加油站点。在第二阶段，开发了多个混合整数线性规划（MILP）配方，以计划无人机和加油车辆的最佳路线，并考虑到第一阶段产生的可行的加油场地。根据经验比较不同配方的性能。另外，开发计算有效的启发式算法来解决路由问题。进行大量的模拟来证实所提出的方法的有效性。
