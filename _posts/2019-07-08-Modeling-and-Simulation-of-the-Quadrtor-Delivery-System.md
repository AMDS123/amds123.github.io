##### Abstract
Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) quadrotor is a UAV with four rotors. The quadrotor control is a difficult task because the four-wheel system is inefficient. The purpose of this paper is to provide specifications and implement a separate quad system that integrates data from the camera and IMU (Inertial Measurement Unit) to allow high -resolution optical transmission. In this paper, a separate quad system was proposed. The system specification is specified. The system application introduced the SolidWorks design of the system, the mathematical modeling of the pickup and delivery (PDP) problem. The simulation results using MATLB for model implementation and the simultaneous localization and mapp ing (SLAM) were presented using the Extended Kalman (EKF-SLAM) filter algorithm used to make the system independent. Experimental results were introduced to use the candy edge detection algorithm.
