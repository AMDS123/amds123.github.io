##### Abstract
When searching for an object humans navigate through a scene using semantic information and spatial relationships. We look for an object using our knowledge of its attributes and relationships with other objects to infer the probable location. In this paper, we propose to tackle the visual navigation problem using rich semantic representations of the observed scene and object-oriented targets to train an agent. We show that both allows the agent to generalize to new targets and unseen scene in a short amount of training time.
