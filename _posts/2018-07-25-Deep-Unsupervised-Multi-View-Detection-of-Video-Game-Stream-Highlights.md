##### Abstract
We consider the problem of automatic highlight-detection in video game streams. Currently, the vast majority of highlight-detection systems for games are triggered by the occurrence of hard-coded game events (e.g., score change, end-game), while most advanced tools and techniques are based on detection of highlights via visual analysis of game footage. We argue that in the context of game streaming, events that may constitute highlights are not only dependent on game footage, but also on social signals that are conveyed by the streamer during the play session (e.g., when interacting with viewers, or when commenting and reacting to the game). In this light, we present a multi-view unsupervised deep learning methodology for novelty-based highlight detection. The method jointly analyses both game footage and social signals such as the players facial expressions and speech, and shows promising results for generating highlights on streams of popular games such as Player Unknown's Battlegrounds.

我们考虑视频游戏流中的自动高亮检测问题。目前，绝大多数用于游戏的高亮度检测系统是由硬编码游戏事件（例如，分数变化，最终游戏）的发生触发的，而大多数高级工具和技术是基于通过视觉分析来检测高光。游戏画面。我们认为，在游戏流的背景下，可能构成亮点的事件不仅取决于游戏镜头，还取决于在播放期间由流光传达的社交信号（例如，当与观众交互时，或者在评论时和对游戏做出反应）。有鉴于此，我们提出了一种基于新颖性高光检测的多视图无监督深度学习方法。该方法共同分析游戏镜头和社交信号，例如玩家的面部表情和语音，并且显示用于在诸如玩家未知的战场之类的流行游戏流上生成亮点的有希望的结果。
