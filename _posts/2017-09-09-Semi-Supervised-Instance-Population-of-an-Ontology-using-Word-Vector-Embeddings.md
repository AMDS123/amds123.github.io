##### Abstract
In many modern day systems such as information extraction and knowledge management agents, ontologies play a vital role in maintaining the concept hierarchies of the selected domain. However, ontology population has become a problematic process due to its nature of heavy coupling with manual human intervention. With the use of word embeddings in the field of natural language processing, it became a popular topic due to its ability to cope up with semantic sensitivity. Hence, in this study, we propose a novel way of semi-supervised ontology population through word embeddings as the basis. We built several models including traditional benchmark models and new types of models which are based on word embeddings. Finally, we ensemble them together to come up with a synergistic model with better accuracy. We demonstrate that our ensemble model can outperform the individual models.

在许多现代系统中，如信息抽取和知识管理代理，本体在维护所选领域的概念层次结构中发挥着至关重要的作用。然而，本体人口由于其与人工干预的紧密结合的性质而成为一个有问题的过程。随着在自然语言处理领域中使用单词嵌入，由于其能够应对语义敏感性，它成为了一个热门话题。因此，在本研究中，我们提出了一种半监督本体人口通过词嵌入作为基础的新方法。我们构建了包括传统基准模型和基于词嵌入的新型模型在内的多个模型。最后，我们把它们组合在一起，提出一个更好的协同模型。我们证明我们的集合模型可以超越个人模型。
