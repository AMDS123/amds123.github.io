##### Abstract
We study the emergence of communication in multiagent adversarial settings inspired by the classic Imitation game. A class of three player games is used to explore how agents based on sequence to sequence (Seq2Seq) models can learn to communicate information in adversarial settings. We propose a modeling approach, an initial set of experiments and use signaling theory to support our analysis. In addition, we describe how we operationalize the learning process of actor-critic Seq2Seq based agents in these communicational games.
