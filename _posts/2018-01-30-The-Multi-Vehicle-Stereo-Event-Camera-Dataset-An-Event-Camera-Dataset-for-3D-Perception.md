##### Abstract
Event based cameras are a new passive sensing modality with a number of benefits over traditional cameras, including extremely low latency, asynchronous data acquisition, high dynamic range and very low power consumption. There has been a lot of recent interest and development in applying algorithms to use the events to perform a variety of 3D perception tasks, such as feature tracking, visual odometry, and stereo depth estimation. However, there currently lacks the wealth of labeled data that exists for traditional cameras to be used for both testing and development. In this paper, we present a large dataset with a synchronized stereo pair event based camera system, carried on a handheld rig, flown by a hexacopter, driven on top of a car and mounted on a motorcycle, in a variety of different illumination levels and environments. From each camera, we provide the event stream, grayscale images and IMU readings. In addition, we utilize a combination of IMU, a rigidly mounted lidar system, indoor and outdoor motion capture and GPS to provide accurate pose and depth images for each camera at up to 100Hz. For comparison, we also provide synchronized grayscale images and IMU readings from a frame based stereo camera system.

基于事件的摄像机是一种新型的被动式传感方式，与传统摄像机相比具有许多优势，包括极低的延迟，异步数据采集，高动态范围和极低的功耗。在应用算法来使用事件来执行各种3D感知任务（诸如特征跟踪，视觉测距和立体声深度估计）方面近来已经有许多兴趣和发展。然而，目前缺乏传统相机用于测试和开发的大量标记数据。在本文中，我们提出了一个基于同步立体对事件的摄像系统的大型数据集，搭载手持式钻机，由六轴飞行器驱动，在汽车的顶部驾驶，并安装在摩托车上，在各种不同的照明级别环境。从每个摄像头，我们提供事件流，灰度图像和IMU读数。此外，我们利用IMU，刚性安装的激光雷达系统，室内和室外运动捕捉以及GPS的组合，为每台摄像机提供精确的姿势和深度图像，最高可达100Hz。为了进行比较，我们还提供了基于帧的立体相机系统的同步灰度图像和IMU读数。
