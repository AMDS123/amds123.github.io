##### Abstract
A mixed group of manned and unmanned aerial vehicles is considered as a distributed system. A lattice of tasks which may be fulfilled by the system matches to it. An external multiplication operation is defined at the lattice, which defines correspondingly linear logic operations. Linear implication and tensor product are used to choose a system reconfiguration variant, i.e., to determine a new task executor choice. The task lattice structure (i.e., the system purpose) and the operation definitions largely define the choice. Thus, the choice is mainly the system purpose consequence. Such a method of the behavior variant choice facilitates the decision making by the pilot controlling the group. The suggested approach is illustrated using an example of a mixed group control at forest fire compression.
