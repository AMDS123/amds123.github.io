##### Abstract
Over the years, hand gesture recognition has been mostly addressed considering hand trajectories in isolation. However, in most sign languages, hand gestures are defined on a particular context (body region). We propose a pipeline to perform sign language recognition which models hand movements in the context of other parts of the body captured in the 3D space using the MS Kinect sensor. In addition, we perform sign recognition based on the different hand postures that occur during a sign. Our experiments show that considering different body parts brings improved performance when compared to other methods which only consider global hand trajectories. Finally, we demonstrate that the combination of hand postures features with hand gestures features helps to improve the prediction of a given sign.

多年来，手势识别主要是考虑手部轨迹的孤立。但是，在大多数手语中，手势是在特定的上下文（身体区域）上定义的。我们建议使用MS Kinect传感器来执行手语识别的流水线，以手动方式在3D空间中捕获的身体的其他部位的上下文中进行建模。另外，我们根据标志中出现的不同手势进行标志识别。我们的实验表明，与仅考虑全局手部轨迹的其他方法相比，考虑不同的身体部位带来了改进的性能。最后，我们证明手势特征与手势特征的组合有助于改进给定符号的预测。
