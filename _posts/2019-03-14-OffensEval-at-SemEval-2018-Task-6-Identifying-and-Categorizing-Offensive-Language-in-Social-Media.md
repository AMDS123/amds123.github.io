##### Abstract
This document describes our approach to building an Offensive Language Classifier. More specifically, the coursework required us to build three classifiers with slightly different goals: 
 - Offensive language identification: would classify a tweet as offensive or not. 
 - Automatic categorization of offense types: would recognize if the target of the offense was an individual or not. 
 - Offense target identification: would identify the target of the offense between an individual, group or other. In this report, we will discuss the different architectures, algorithms and pre-processing strategies we tried, together with a detailed description of the designs of our final classifiers and the reasons we choose them over others.
