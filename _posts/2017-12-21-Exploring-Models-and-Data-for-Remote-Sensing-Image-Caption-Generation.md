##### Abstract
Inspired by recent development of artificial satellite, remote sensing images have attracted extensive attention. Recently, noticeable progress has been made in scene classification and target detection.However, it is still not clear how to describe the remote sensing image content with accurate and concise sentences. In this paper, we investigate to describe the remote sensing images with accurate and flexible sentences. First, some annotated instructions are presented to better describe the remote sensing images considering the special characteristics of remote sensing images. Second, in order to exhaustively exploit the contents of remote sensing images, a large-scale aerial image data set is constructed for remote sensing image caption. Finally, a comprehensive review is presented on the proposed data set to fully advance the task of remote sensing caption. Extensive experiments on the proposed data set demonstrate that the content of the remote sensing image can be completely described by generating language descriptions. The data set is available at this https URL

受近期人造卫星发展的启发，遥感图像引起了广泛关注。近年来，在场景分类和目标检测方面取得了明显进展。但是，如何用准确简洁的句子描述遥感图像内容尚不清楚。在本文中，我们研究用准确和灵活的句子描述遥感图像。首先，考虑到遥感图像的特殊特性，提出了一些注释指令以更好地描述遥感图像。其次，为了彻底利用遥感图像的内容，构建了用于遥感图像标题的大规模航空图像数据集。最后，对拟议的数据集进行了全面审查，以充分推进遥感字幕的任务。对所提出的数据集的广泛实验表明，可以通过生成语言描述来完整地描述遥感图像的内容。该https URL提供了该数据集
