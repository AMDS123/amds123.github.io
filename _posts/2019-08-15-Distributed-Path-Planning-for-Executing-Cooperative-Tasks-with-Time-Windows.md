##### Abstract
We investigate the distributed planning of robot trajectories for optimal execution of cooperative tasks with time windows. In this setting, each task has a value and is completed if sufficiently many robots are simultaneously present at the necessary location within the specified time window. Tasks keep arriving periodically over cycles. The task specifications (required number of robots, location, time window, and value) are unknown a priori and the robots try to maximize the value of completed tasks by planning their own trajectories for the upcoming cycle based on their past observations in a distributed manner. Considering the recharging and maintenance needs, robots are required to start and end each cycle at their assigned stations located in the environment. We map this problem to a game theoretic formulation and maximize the collective performance through distributed learning. Some simulation results are also provided to demonstrate the performance of the proposed approach.
