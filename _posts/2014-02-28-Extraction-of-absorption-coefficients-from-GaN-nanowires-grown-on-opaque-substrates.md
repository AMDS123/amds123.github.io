##### Abstract
We demonstrate a new method to measure absorption coefficients in any family of nanowires, provided they are grown on a substrate having considerable difference in permittivity with the nanowire-air matrix. In the case of high crystal quality, strain-free GaN nanowires, grown on Si (111) substrates with a density of ~1010 cm-2, the extracted absorption coefficients do not exhibit any enhancement compared to bulk GaN values, unlike relevant claims in the literature. This may be attributed to the relatively small diameters, short heights, and high densities of our nanowire arrays.
