##### Abstract
Real-world face detection and alignment demand an advanced discriminative model to address challenges by pose, lighting and expression. Illuminated by the deep learning algorithm, some convolutional neural networks based face detection and alignment methods have been proposed. Recent studies have utilized the relation between face detection and alignment to make models computationally efficiency, however they ignore the connection between each cascade CNNs. In this paper, we propose an structure to propose higher quality training data for End-to-End cascade network training, which give computers more space to automatic adjust weight parameter and accelerate convergence. Experiments demonstrate considerable improvement over existing detection and alignment models.

真实世界的人脸检测和对齐需要先进的区分模型来解决姿势，照明和表情的挑战。在深度学习算法的启发下，提出了一些基于卷积神经网络的人脸检测和对齐方法。最近的研究利用人脸检测和对准之间的关系，使模型的计算效率，但他们忽略了每个级联CNN之间的联系。在本文中，我们提出了一种结构来提出更高质量的端到端级联网络训练数据，给计算机更多的空间来自动调整权重参数，加速收敛。实验证明相对于现有的检测和对准模型有相当的改进。
