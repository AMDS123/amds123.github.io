##### Abstract
Highway deep neural network (HDNN) is a type of depth-gated feedforward neural network, which has shown to be easier to train with more hidden layers and also generalise better compared to conventional plain deep neural networks (DNNs). Previously, we investigated a structured HDNN architecture for speech recognition, in which the two gate functions were tied across all the hidden layers, and we were able to train a much smaller model without sacrificing the recognition accuracy. In this paper, we carry on the study of this architecture with sequence-discriminative training criterion and speaker adaptation techniques on the AMI meeting speech recognition corpus. We show that these two techniques improve speech recognition accuracy on top of the model trained with the cross entropy criterion. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the two gate functions that are tied across all the hidden layers are able to control the information flow over the whole network, and we can achieve considerable improvements by only updating these gate functions in both sequence training and adaptation experiments.

公路深度神经网络（HDNN）是一种深度门控前馈神经网络，与传统的平面深度神经网络（DNNs）相比，其表现出更容易训练隐含层数更多，泛化能力更强。在此之前，我们研究了一种用于语音识别的结构化HDNN体系结构，其中两个门功能与所有隐藏层相关联，并且我们能够在不牺牲识别准确性的情况下训练更小的模型。在本文中，我们在AMI会议语音识别语料库上进行了具有序列辨别训练准则和说话人自适应技术的该架构的研究。我们表明，这两种技术提高了交叉熵准则训练模型的顶部的语音识别的准确性。此外，我们证明了所有隐藏层上的两个门函数能够控制整个网络上的信息流，只有在序列训练和适应性实验中才更新这些门函数，我们可以获得相当大的改进。
