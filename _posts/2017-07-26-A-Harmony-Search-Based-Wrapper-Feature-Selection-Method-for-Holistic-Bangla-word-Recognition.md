##### Abstract
A lot of search approaches have been explored for the selection of features in pattern classification domain in order to discover significant subset of the features which produces better accuracy. In this paper, we introduced a Harmony Search (HS) algorithm based feature selection method for feature dimensionality reduction in handwritten Bangla word recognition problem. This algorithm has been implemented to reduce the feature dimensionality of a technique described in one of our previous papers by S. Bhowmik et al.[1]. In the said paper, a set of 65 elliptical features were computed for handwritten Bangla word recognition purpose and a recognition accuracy of 81.37% was achieved using Multi Layer Perceptron (MLP) classifier. In the present work, a subset containing 48 features (approximately 75% of said feature vector) has been selected by HS based wrapper feature selection method which produces an accuracy rate of 90.29%. Reasonable outcomes also validates that the introduced algorithm utilizes optimal number of features while showing higher classification accuracies when compared to two standard evolutionary algorithms like Genetic Algorithm (GA), Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) and statistical feature dimensionality reduction technique like Principal Component Analysis (PCA). This confirms the suitability of HS algorithm to the holistic handwritten word recognition problem.

已经探索了许多搜索方法来选择模式分类领域中的特征，以发现产生更好精度的重要子集。本文介绍了一种基于Harmony Search（HS）算法的手写体Bangla单词识别问题中的特征降维特征选择方法。这个算法已经被用来减少S.Bhowmik等人[1]在我们以前的论文中描述过的技术的特征维数。在该论文中，计算了一组65个椭圆形特征用于手写体Bangla单词识别的目的，使用多层感知器（MLP）分类器实现了81.37％的识别准确度。在目前的工作中，一个包含48个特征（大约75％的特征向量）的子集已经被基于HS的包装特征选择方法所选择，其产生90.29％的准确率。合理的结果也证实，与遗传算法（GA），粒子群优化（PSO）和主成分分析（PCA）等统计特征降维技术相比，引入的算法利用了最优特征数，同时显示出更高的分类准确率。 ）。这证实了HS算法对整体手写单词识别问题的适用性。
