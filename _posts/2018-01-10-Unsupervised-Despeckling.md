##### Abstract
Contrast and quality of ultrasound images are adversely affected by the excessive presence of speckle. However, being an inherent imaging property, speckle helps in tissue characterization and tracking. Thus, despeckling of the ultrasound images requires the reduction of speckle extent without any oversmoothing. In this letter, we aim to address the despeckling problem using an unsupervised deep adversarial approach. A despeckling residual neural network (DRNN) is trained with an adversarial loss imposed by a discriminator. The discriminator tries to differentiate between the despeckled images generated by the DRNN and the set of high-quality images. Further to prevent the developed DRNN from oversmoothing, a structural loss term is used along with the adversarial loss. Experimental evaluations show that the proposed DRNN is able to outperform the state-of-the-art despeckling approaches.

超声图像的对比度和质量受到散斑过度存在的不利影响。然而，作为固有的成像特性，斑点有助于组织表征和跟踪。因此，超声图像的去斑需要减少斑点范围而没有任何过度平滑。在这封信中，我们的目标是使用无监督的深度对抗方法来解决去斑问题。一个去斑残留神经网络（DRNN）受到鉴别器施加的对抗损失的训练。鉴别器试图区分由DRNN生成的去斑图像和一组高质量图像。进一步为了防止发展的DRNN过度平滑，结构损失术语与对抗损失一起使用。实验评估表明，提出的DRNN能够超越最先进的去斑方法。
