##### Abstract
Cephalometric tracing method is usually used in orthodontic diagnosis and treat-ment planning. In this paper, we propose a deep learning based framework to au-tomatically detect anatomical landmarks in cephalometric X-ray images. We train the deep encoder-decoder for landmark detection, and combine global landmark configuration with local high-resolution feature responses. The proposed frame-work is based on 2-stage u-net, regressing the multi-channel heatmaps for land-mark detection. In this framework, we embed attention mechanism with global stage heatmaps, guiding the local stage inferring, to regress the local heatmap patches in a high resolution. Besides, the Expansive Exploration strategy im-proves robustness while inferring, expanding the searching scope without in-creasing model complexity. We have evaluated our framework in the most wide-ly-used public dataset of landmark detection in cephalometric X-ray images. With less computation and manually tuning, our framework achieves state-of-the-art results.
