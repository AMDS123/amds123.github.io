##### Abstract
This paper presents a non-parametric approach for segmenting trees from airborne LiDAR data in deciduous forests. Based on the LiDAR point cloud, the approach collects crown information such as steepness and height on-the-fly to delineate crown boundaries, and most importantly, does not require a priori assumptions of crown shape and size. The approach segments trees iteratively starting from the tallest within a given area to the smallest until all trees have been segmented. To evaluate its performance, the approach was applied to the University of Kentucky Robinson Forest, a deciduous closed-canopy forest with complex terrain and vegetation conditions. The approach identified 94% of dominant and co-dominant trees with a false detection rate of 13%. About 62% of intermediate, overtopped, and dead trees were also detected with a false detection rate of 15%. The overall segmentation accuracy was 77%. Correlations of the segmentation scores of the proposed approach with local terrain and stand metrics was not significant, which is likely an indication of the robustness of the approach as results are not sensitive to the differences in terrain and stand structures.

本文提出了一种非参数化的方法来分割来自落叶林中的机载LiDAR数据的树。在LiDAR点云的基础上，该方法可以实时采集陡坡和高度等冠状信息来描绘冠层边界，最重要的是，不需要对冠形和大小的先验假设。该方法将树从给定区域内的最高处开始迭代地分割到最小，直到所有的树被分割为止。为了评估其性能，该方法被应用于肯塔基大学罗宾逊森林，这是一个落叶密闭的冠层森林，地形和植被条件复杂。该方法确定了94％的优势树和共优势树，错误检测率为13％。大约有62％的中度，过度和枯死的树木也被发现，错误检测率为15％。整体分割准确率为77％。所提出的方法的分割分数与局部地形和站立度量的相关性不显着，这可能表明该方法的鲁棒性，因为结果对地形和立场结构的差异不敏感。
