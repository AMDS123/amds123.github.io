##### Abstract
Code corpora, as observed in large software systems, are now known to be far more repetitive and predictable than natural language corpora. But why? Does the difference simply arise from the syntactic limitations of programming languages? Or does it arise from the differences in authoring decisions made by the writers of these natural and programming language texts? We conjecture that the differences are not entirely due to syntax, but also from the fact that reading and writing code is un-natural for humans, and requires substantial mental effort; so, people prefer to write code in ways that are familiar to both reader and writer. To support this argument, we present results from two sets of studies: 1) a first set aimed at attenuating the effects of syntax, and 2) a second, aimed at measuring repetitiveness of text written in other settings (e.g. second language, technical/specialized jargon), which are also effortful to write. We find find that this repetition in source code is not entirely the result of grammar constraints, and thus some repetition must result from human choice. While the evidence we find of similar repetitive behavior in technical and learner corpora does not conclusively show that such language is used by humans to mitigate difficulty, it is consistent with that theory.

正如在大型软件系统中所观察到的，代码语料库现在已知比自然语言语料库更加重复和可预测。但为什么？差异是否仅仅是由编程语言的语法限制引起的？或者它是否源于这些自然语言和编程语言文本的作者在创作决定方面的差异？我们猜想，这些差异并非完全归因于语法，而是因为阅读和编写代码对人类来说是不自然的，并且需要大量的精力;所以，人们更喜欢用读者和作者都熟悉的方式编写代码。为了支持这个论点，我们提出了两组研究的结果：1）旨在减弱语法效果的第一组; 2）旨在测量其他设置中所写文本的重复性（如第二语言，技术/专业术语），这也是努力写作。我们发现，源代码中的这种重复不完全是语法约束的结果，因此一些重复必须由人的选择产生。虽然我们在技术和学习者语料库中发现的类似重复行为的证据并不能确定地表明这种语言被人类用来缓解困难，但它与该理论是一致的。
