##### Abstract
Feature Selection Library (FSLib) is a widely applicable MATLAB library for Feature Selection (FS). FS is an essential component of machine learning and data mining which has been studied for many years under many different conditions and in diverse scenarios. These algorithms aim at ranking and selecting a subset of relevant features according to their degrees of relevance, preference, or importance as defined in a specific application. Because feature selection can reduce the amount of features used for training classification models, it alleviates the effect of the curse of dimensionality, speeds up the learning process, improves model's performance, and enhances data understanding. This short report provides an overview of the feature selection algorithms included in the FSLib MATLAB toolbox among filter, embedded, and wrappers methods.

特征选择库（FSLib）是一种广泛应用的特征选择（FS）MATLAB库。 FS是机器学习和数据挖掘的重要组成部分，已经在许多不同的条件和不同的情况下进行了多年的研究。这些算法旨在根据特定应用中定义的相关度，偏好或重要性对相关特征的子集进行排序和选择。因为特征选择可以减少用于训练分类模型的特征量，所以它减轻了维度诅咒的影响，加速了学习过程，提高了模型的性能，并增强了数据理解。这篇简短的报告概述了过滤器，嵌入式和包装器方法中FSLib MATLAB工具箱中包含的特征选择算法。
