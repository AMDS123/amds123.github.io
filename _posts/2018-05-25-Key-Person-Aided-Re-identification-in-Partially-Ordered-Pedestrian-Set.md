##### Abstract
Ideally person re-identification seeks for perfect feature representation and metric model that re-identify all various pedestrians well in non-overlapping views at different locations with different camera configurations, which is very challenging. However, in most pedestrian sets, there always are some outstanding persons who are relatively easy to re-identify. Inspired by the existence of such data division, we propose a novel key person aided person re-identification framework based on the re-defined partially ordered pedestrian sets. The outstanding persons, namely "key persons", are selected by the K-nearest neighbor based saliency measurement. The partial order defined by pedestrian entering time in surveillance associates the key persons with the query person temporally and helps to locate the possible candidates. Experiments conducted on two video datasets show that the proposed key person aided framework outperforms the state-of-the-art methods and improves the matching accuracy greatly at all ranks.

理想情况下，人员重新识别寻求完美的特征表示和度量模型，以不同的摄像机配置在不同位置以不重叠的视图重新识别所有各种行人，这非常具有挑战性。然而，在大多数行人套装中，总会有一些相对容易重新识别的杰出人物。受到这种数据分割的启发，我们提出了一种基于重新定义的部分有序行人集的新型关键人员辅助人员重新识别框架。杰出人物，即“关键人物”，是通过基于K近邻的显着度测量来选择的。行人在监控中进入时间所定义的偏序在时间上将关键人员与查询人联系起来，并有助于找到可能的候选人。对两个视频数据集进行的实验表明，所提出的关键人物辅助框架优于最先进的方法，并且在各个级别大大提高了匹配精度。
