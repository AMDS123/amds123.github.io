##### Abstract
This paper proposes an extension to the Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), namely as ARTGAN to synthetically generate more challenging and complex images such as artwork that have abstract characteristics. This is in contrast to most of the current solutions that focused on generating natural images such as room interiors, birds, flowers and faces. The key innovation of our work is to allow back-propagation of the loss function w.r.t. the labels (randomly assigned to each generated images) to the generator from the discriminator. With the feedback from the label information, the generator is able to learn faster and achieve better generated image quality. Empirically, we show that the proposed ARTGAN is capable to create realistic artwork, as well as generate compelling real world images that globally look natural with clear shape on CIFAR-10.

本文提出了对生成敌对网络（GAN）的扩展，即ARTGAN来综合生成更具挑战性和复杂性的图像，如具有抽象特征的图形。这与目前大多数解决方案形成对比，这些解决方案专注于生成室内，鸟，花和脸等自然图像。我们工作的关键创新是允许损失函数w.r.t的反向传播。标识符（随机分配给每个生成的图像）​​从鉴别器发送到生成器。借助标签信息的反馈，生成器能够更快学习，并获得更好的生成图像质量。实证上，我们表明，ARTGAN能够创造逼真的艺术作品，并且能够生成引人入胜的真实世界的图像，在CIFAR-10上呈现清晰的自然形状。
