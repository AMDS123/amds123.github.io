##### Abstract
Semiconductor heterostructures based on layered two-dimensional transition metal dichalcogenides (TMD) interfaced to gallium nitride (GaN) are excellent material systems to realize broadband light emitters and absorbers. The surface properties of the polar semiconductor, such as GaN are dominated by interface phonons, thus the optical properties of the vertical heterostructure depend strongly on the interface exciton-phonon coupling. The origin and activation of different Raman modes in the heterostructure due to coupling between interfacial phonons and optically generated carriers in a monolayer MoS2-GaN (0001) heterostructure was observed. This coupling strongly influences the non-equilibrium absorption properties of MoS2 and the emission properties of both semiconductors. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations were performed to study the band alignment of the interface, which revealed a type-I heterostructure. The optical excitation with interband transition in MoS2 at K-point strongly modulates the C excitonic band in MoS2. The overlap of absorption and emission bands of GaN with the absorption bands of MoS2 induces the energy and charge transfer across the interface with an optical excitation at {\Gamma}-point. A strong modulation of the excitonic absorption states is observed in MoS2 on GaN substrate with transient optical pump-probe spectroscopy. The interaction of carriers with phonons and defect states leads to the enhanced and blue shifted emission in MoS2 on GaN substrate. Our results demonstrate the relevance of interface coupling between phonons and carriers for the development of optical and electronic applications.
