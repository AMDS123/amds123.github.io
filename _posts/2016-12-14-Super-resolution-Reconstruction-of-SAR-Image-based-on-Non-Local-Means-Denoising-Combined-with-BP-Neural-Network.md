##### Abstract
In this article, we propose a super-resolution method to resolve the problem of image low spatial because of the limitation of imaging devices. We make use of the strong non-linearity mapped ability of the back-propagation neural networks(BPNN). Training sample images are got by undersampled method. The elements chose as the inputs of the BPNN are pixels referred to Non-local means(NL-Means). Making use of the self-similarity of the images, those inputs are the pixels which are pixels gained from modified NL-means which is specific for super-resolution. Besides, small change on core function of NL-means has been applied in the method we use in this article so that we can have a clearer edge in the shrunk image. Experimental results gained from the Peak Signal to Noise Ratio(PSNR) and the Equivalent Number of Look(ENL), indicate that adding the similar pixels as inputs will increase the results than not taking them into consideration.

在这篇文章中，我们提出了一个超分辨率的方法来解决由于成像设备的局限性造成图像空间低的问题。我们利用反向传播神经网络（BPNN）的强非线性映射能力。训练样本图像是通过欠采样方法得到的。选择作为BPNN的输入的元素是被称为非局部均值（NL-Means）的像素。利用图像的自相似性，这些输入是从超分辨率特有的修改的NL-手段获得的像素。此外，我们在本文中使用的方法已经应用了NL-means的核心功能的小改变，以便在缩小的图像中可以具有更清晰的边缘。从峰值信噪比（PSNR）和等效观测数（ENL）获得的实验结果表明，将相似像素添加为输入将增加结果，而不是将其考虑在内。
