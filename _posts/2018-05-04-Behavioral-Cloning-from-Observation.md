##### Abstract
Humans often learn how to perform tasks via imitation: they observe others perform a task, and then very quickly infer the appropriate actions to take based on their observations. While extending this paradigm to autonomous agents is a well-studied problem in general, there are two particular aspects that have largely been overlooked: (1) that the learning is done from observation only (i.e., without explicit action information), and (2) that the learning is typically done very quickly. In this work, we propose a two-phase, autonomous imitation learning technique called behavioral cloning from observation (BCO), that aims to provide improved performance with respect to both of these aspects. First, we allow the agent to acquire experience in a self-supervised fashion. This experience is used to develop a model which is then utilized to learn a particular task by observing an expert perform that task without the knowledge of the specific actions taken. We experimentally compare BCO to imitation learning methods, including the state-of-the-art, generative adversarial imitation learning (GAIL) technique, and we show comparable task performance in several different simulation domains while exhibiting increased learning speed after expert trajectories become available.

人类通常会学习如何通过模仿执行任务：他们观察其他人执行任务，然后根据他们的观察很快推断出适当的行动。虽然将这种范式扩展到自主智能体是一个广泛研究的问题，但有两个特定方面在很大程度上被忽略：（1）学习是仅从观察（即没有明确的行动信息）和（2 ）通常学习速度非常快。在这项工作中，我们提出了一种两阶段，自主模仿学习技术，称为从观察行为克隆（BCO），旨在提高这两方面的性能。首先，我们允许代理人以自我监督的方式获得经验。这种经验被用来开发一种模型，然后通过观察专家在不知道所采取的具体行动的情况下执行该任务来学习特定任务。我们将BCO与仿真学习方法进行了实验性比较，其中包括最先进的生成对抗仿制学习（GAIL）技术，并且我们在几个不同的仿真领域中展示了可比的任务性能，同时在专家轨迹可用后表现出提高的学习速度。
