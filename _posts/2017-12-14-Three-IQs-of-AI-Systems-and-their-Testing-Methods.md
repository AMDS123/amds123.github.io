##### Abstract
The rapid development of artificial intelligence has brought the artificial intelligence threat theory as well as the problem about how to evaluate the intelligence level of intelligent products. Both need to find a quantitative method to evaluate the intelligence level of intelligence systems, including human intelligence. Based on the standard intelligence system and the extended Von Neumann architecture, this paper proposes General IQ, Service IQ and Value IQ evaluation methods for intelligence systems, depending on different evaluation purposes. Among them, the General IQ of intelligence systems is to answer the question of whether the artificial intelligence can surpass the human intelligence, which is reflected in putting the intelligence systems on an equal status and conducting the unified evaluation. The Service IQ and Value IQ of intelligence systems are used to answer the question of how the intelligent products can better serve the human, reflecting the intelligence and required cost of each intelligence system as a product in the process of serving human.

人工智能的飞速发展带来了人工智能威胁理论以及如何评估智能产品智能化水平的问题。两者都需要找到定量的方法来评估智力系统的智力水平，包括人的智力水平。基于标准智能系统和扩展冯诺依曼架构，本文根据不同的评估目的，提出了智能系统的通用智商，服务智商和价值智商评估方法。其中，智能系统的总体智商就是要回答人工智能是否能超越人的智能，这体现在把智能系统置于平等地位，进行统一评估。智能系统的服务智商和价值智商被用来回答智能产品如何能够更好地服务于人的问题，反映出每个智能系统在为人服务的过程中作为产品的智慧和所需的成本。
