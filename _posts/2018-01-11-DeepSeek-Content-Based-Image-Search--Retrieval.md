##### Abstract
Most of the internet today is composed of digital media that includes videos and images. With pixels becoming the currency in which most transactions happen on the internet, it is becoming increasingly important to have a way of browsing through this ocean of information with relative ease. YouTube has 400 hours of video uploaded every minute and many million images are browsed on Instagram, Facebook, etc. Inspired by recent advances in the field of deep learning and success that it has gained on various problems like image captioning and, machine translation , word2vec , skip thoughts, etc, we present DeepSeek a natural language processing based deep learning model that allows users to enter a description of the kind of images that they want to search, and in response the system retrieves all the images that semantically and contextually relate to the query. Two approaches are described in the following sections.

今天的大部分互联网都是由包含视频和图像的数字媒体组成。随着像素成为大多数交易在互联网上发生的货币，拥有一种相对容易地浏览这些信息海洋的方式变得越来越重要。 YouTube每分钟上传400小时的视频，并在Instagram，Facebook等上浏览数百万张图片。受到深度学习和成功领域的最新进展的启发，它已经在图像字幕和机器翻译等各种问题上获得了成功，word2vec ，跳过思考等，我们向DeepSeek提供基于自然语言处理的深度学习模型，该模型允许用户输入他们想要搜索的图像类型的描述，并且作为响应，系统检索语义和上下文相关的所有图像。查询。以下各节介绍了两种方法。
