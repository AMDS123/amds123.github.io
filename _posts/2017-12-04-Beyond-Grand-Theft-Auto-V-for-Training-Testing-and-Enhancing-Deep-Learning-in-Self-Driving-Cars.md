##### Abstract
As an initial assessment, over 480,000 labeled virtual images of normal highway driving were readily generated in Grand Theft Auto V's virtual environment. Using these images, a CNN was trained to detect following distance to cars/objects ahead, lane markings, and driving angle (angular heading relative to lane centerline): all variables necessary for basic autonomous driving. Encouraging results were obtained when tested on over 50,000 labeled virtual images from substantially different GTA-V driving environments. This initial assessment begins to define both the range and scope of the labeled images needed for training as well as the range and scope of labeled images needed for testing the definition of boundaries and limitations of trained networks. It is the efficacy and flexibility of a "GTA-V"-like virtual environment that is expected to provide an efficient well-defined foundation for the training and testing of Convolutional Neural Networks for safe driving. Additionally, described is the Princeton Virtual Environment (PVE) for the training, testing and enhancement of safe driving AI, which is being developed using the video-game engine Unity. PVE is being developed to recreate rare but critical corner cases that can be used in re-training and enhancing machine learning models and understanding the limitations of current self driving models. The Florida Tesla crash is being used as an initial reference.

作为初步评估，在“侠盗猎车手5”的虚拟环境中，有超过48万个正常高速公路标记的虚拟图像很容易生成。使用这些图像，CNN被训练以检测与前方车辆/物体，车道标记和行驶角度（相对于车道中心线的角度方向）之间的距离：基本自主驾驶所需的所有变量。当对来自基本上不同的GTA-V驾驶环境的超过50,000个标记的虚拟图像进行测试时获得令人鼓舞的结果。初始评估开始定义训练所需标记图像的范围和范围，以及测试经过训练的网络的边界和局限性所需的标记图像的范围和范围。这是“GTA-V”型虚拟环境的功效和灵活性，预计将为安全驾驶的卷积神经网络的训练和测试提供有效的明确基础。此外，还介绍了使用视频游戏引擎Unity开发的安全驾驶AI的培训，测试和增强的普林斯顿虚拟环境（PVE）。 PVE正在被开发来重新创造罕见的但关键的角落案例，可用于重新培训和提高机器学习模型，并了解当前的自我驾驶模式的局限性。佛罗里达州特斯拉崩溃正被用作初始参考。
