##### Abstract
This paper presents a high-level conceptual framework to help orient the discussion and implementation of open-endedness in evolutionary systems. Drawing upon earlier work by Banzhaf et al., three different kinds of open-endedness are identified: exploratory, expansive, and transformational. These are characterised in terms of their relationship to the search space of phenotypic behaviours. A formalism is introduced to describe three key processes required for an evolutionary process: the generation of a phenotype from a genetic description, the evaluation of that phenotype, and the reproduction with variation of individuals according to their evaluation. The formalism makes explicit various influences in each of these processes that can easily be overlooked. The distinction is made between intrinsic and extrinsic implementations of these processes. A discussion then investigates how various interactions between these processes, and their modes of implementation, can lead to open-endedness. However, it is demonstrated that these considerations relate to exploratory open-endedness only. Conditions for the implementation of the more interesting kinds of open-endedness - expansive and transformational - are also discussed, emphasizing factors such as multiple domains of behaviour, transdomain bridges, and non-additive compositional systems. In contrast to a traditional "neo-Darwinian" analysis, these factors relate not to the generic evolutionary properties of individuals, but rather to the nature of the building blocks out of which individual organisms are constructed, and the laws and properties of the environment in which they exist. The paper ends with suggestions of how the framework can be used to categorise and compare the open-ended evolutionary potential of different systems, and how it might guide the design of systems with greater capacity for open-ended evolution.

本文提出了一个高级概念框架来帮助定位进化系统中开放性的讨论和实现。借鉴Banzhaf等人的早期工作，确定了三种不同的开放性：探索性，扩张性和转型性。这些特征表现为与表型行为的搜索空间的关系。引入形式主义来描述进化过程所需的三个关键过程：从遗传描述中产生表型，评估表型，以及根据个体评估对个体进行繁殖。形式主义在这些容易被忽视的过程中给出了明确的各种影响。区分这些过程的内在和外在实现。然后讨论调查这些过程之间的各种相互作用及其实施方式如何导致开放性。然而，证明这些考虑只涉及探索性的开放性。还讨论了实施更有趣的开放性条件 - 扩张性和转型性 - 也强调诸如多个行为域，跨域桥梁和非附加组成系统等因素。与传统的“新达尔文主义”分析相比，这些因素与个人的一般进化属性无关，而与个体生物构建的建筑物的性质以及环境的法律和性质有关它们存在。本文最后提出了如何使用框架对不同系统的开放式演化潜力进行分类和比较的建议，以及如何指导具有更大开放式演进能力的系统设计。
