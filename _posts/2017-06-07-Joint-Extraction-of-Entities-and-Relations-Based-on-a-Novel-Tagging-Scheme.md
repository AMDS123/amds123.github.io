##### Abstract
Joint extraction of entities and relations is an important task in information extraction. To tackle this problem, we firstly propose a novel tagging scheme that can convert the joint extraction task to a tagging problem. Then, based on our tagging scheme, we study different end-to-end models to extract entities and their relations directly, without identifying entities and relations separately. We conduct experiments on a public dataset produced by distant supervision method and the experimental results show that the tagging based methods are better than most of the existing pipelined and joint learning methods. What's more, the end-to-end model proposed in this paper, achieves the best results on the public dataset.

联合提取实体和关系是信息提取的重要任务。为了解决这个问题，我们首先提出了一种新的标签方案，可以将联合提取任务转换为标签问题。然后，基于我们的标签方案，我们研究不同的端到端模型，直接提取实体及其关系，而不分别识别实体和关系。对远程监控方法产生的公开数据集进行实验，实验结果表明基于标签的方法优于现有的多数流水线和联合学习方法。此外，本文提出的端到端模型在公开数据集上取得了最好的效果。
