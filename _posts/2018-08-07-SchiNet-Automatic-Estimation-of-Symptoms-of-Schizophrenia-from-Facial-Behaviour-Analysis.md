##### Abstract
Patients with schizophrenia often display impairments in the expression of emotion and speech and those are observed in their facial behaviour. Automatic analysis of patients' facial expressions that is aimed at estimating symptoms of schizophrenia has received attention recently. However, the datasets that are typically used for training and evaluating the developed methods, contain only a small number of patients (4-34) and are recorded while the subjects were performing controlled tasks such as listening to life vignettes, or answering emotional questions. In this paper, we use videos of professional-patient interviews, in which symptoms were assessed in a standardised way as they should/may be assessed in practice, and which were recorded in realistic conditions (i.e. varying illumination levels and camera viewpoints) at the patients' homes or at mental health services. We automatically analyse the facial behaviour of 91 out-patients - this is almost 3 times the number of patients in other studies - and propose SchiNet, a novel neural network architecture that estimates expression-related symptoms in two different assessment interviews. We evaluate the proposed SchiNet for patient-independent prediction of symptoms of schizophrenia. Experimental results show that some automatically detected facial expressions are significantly correlated to symptoms of schizophrenia, and that the proposed network for estimating symptom severity delivers promising results.

患有精神分裂症的患者经常在情绪和言语的表达中表现出损伤，并且在他们的面部行为中观察到这些。旨在估计精神分裂症症状的患者面部表情的自动分析最近受到关注。然而，通常用于训练和评估所开发方法的数据集仅包含少数患者（4-34）并且在受试者执行受控任务（例如聆听生活小插曲或回答情绪问题）时被记录。在本文中，我们使用专业 - 患者访谈的视频，其中症状以标准化的方式进行评估，因为它们应该/可能在实践中进行评估，并且在实际情况下（即不同的照明水平和摄像机视点）记录。患者的家或精神卫生服务。我们自动分析91名门诊患者的面部行为 - 这几乎是其他研究中患者数量的3倍 - 并提出了SchiNet，这是一种新型神经网络结构，可在两次不同的评估访谈中估计与表达相关的症状。我们评估拟议的SchiNet用于独立于患者的精神分裂症症状预测。实验结果表明，一些自动检测到的面部表情与精神分裂症的症状显着相关，并且所提出的用于评估症状严重性的网络提供了有希望的结果。
