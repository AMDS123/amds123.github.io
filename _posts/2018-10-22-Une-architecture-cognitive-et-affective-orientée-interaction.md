##### Abstract
In this paper, we present CAIO, a Cognitive and Affective Interaction-Oriented architecture for social human-robot interactions (HRI), allowing robots to reason on mental states (including emotions), and to act physically, emotionally and verbally. We also present a short scenario and implementation on a Nao robot.
