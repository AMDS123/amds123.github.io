##### Abstract
As research on hate speech becomes more and more relevant every day, most of it is still focused on hate speech detection. By attempting to replicate a hate speech detection experiment performed on an existing Twitter corpus annotated for hate speech, we highlight some issues that arise from doing research in the field of hate speech, which is essentially still in its infancy. We take a critical look at the training corpus in order to understand its biases, while also using it to venture beyond hate speech detection and investigate whether it can be used to shed light on other facets of research, such as popularity of hate tweets.

随着对仇恨言论的研究日益变得日益重要，其中大部分仍集中于仇恨言论检测。通过试图复制在现有的用于评论仇恨言论的Twitter语料库上进行的仇恨言语检测实验，我们强调了在进行仇恨言论领域的研究时出现的一些问题，这些问题基本上还处于初级阶段。为了理解它的偏见，我们对训练语料进行批判性的观察，同时也利用它来探索仇恨言语检测，并研究它是否可以用来揭示研究的其他方面，比如仇恨推文的普及。
