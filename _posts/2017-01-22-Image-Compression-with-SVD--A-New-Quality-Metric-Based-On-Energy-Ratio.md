##### Abstract
Digital image compression is a technique that allows to reduce the size of an image in order to increase the capacity storage devices and to optimize the use of network bandwidth. The quality of compressed images with the techniques based on the discrete cosine transform or the wavelet transform is generally measured with PSNR or SSIM. Theses metrics are not suitable to images compressed with the singular values decomposition. This paper presents a new metric based on the energy ratio to measure the quality of the images coded with the SVD. A series of tests on 512 * 512 pixels images show that, for a rank k = 40 corresponding to a SSIM = 0,94 or PSNR = 35 dB, 99,9% of the energy are restored. Three areas of image quality assessments were identified. This new metric is also very accurate and could overcome the weaknesses of PSNR and SSIM.

数字图像压缩技术允许减小图像的大小，以增加容量存储设备并优化网络带宽的使用。通常用PSNR或SSIM来测量基于离散余弦变换或小波变换技术的压缩图像的质量。这些度量不适合用奇异值分解压缩的图像。本文提出了一种基于能量比的新度量方法来度量SVD编码图像的质量。对512×512像素图像进行的一系列测试表明，对于对应于SSIM = 0.94或PSNR = 35dB的等级k = 40，99.9％的能量被恢复。确定了三个图像质量评估领域。这个新的指标也是非常准确的，可以克服PSNR和SSIM的弱点。
