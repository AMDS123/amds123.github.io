##### Abstract
In the recent year, the state-of-the-arts of facial micro-expression recognition task have been significantly advanced by the emergence of data-driven approaches based on deep learning. Due to the superb learning capacity of deep learning, it generates promising performance beyond the traditional handcrafted approaches. Recently, many researchers have focused on developing better networks by increasing its depth, as deep networks can effectively approximate certain function classes more efficiently than shallow ones. In this paper, we aim to design a shallow network to extract the high level features of the micro-expression details. Specifically, a two-layer neural network, namely Shallow Triple Stream Three-dimensional CNN (STSTNet) is proposed. The network is capable to learn the features from three optical flow features (i.e., optical strain, horizontal and vertical optical flow images) computed from the onset and apex frames from each video. Our experimental results demonstrate the viability of the proposed STSTNet, which exhibits the UAR recognition results of 76.05%, 70.13%, 86.86% and 68.10% in composite, SMIC, CASME II and SAMM databases, respectively.
