##### Abstract
Simulators are powerful tools for reasoning about a robot's interactions with its environment. However, when simulations diverge from reality, that reasoning becomes less useful. In this paper, we show how to close the loop between liquid simulation and real-time perception. We use observations of liquids to correct errors when tracking the liquid's state in a simulator. Our results show that closed-loop simulation is an effective way to prevent large divergence between the simulated and real liquid states. As a direct consequence of this, our method can enable reasoning about liquids that would otherwise be infeasible due to large divergences, such as reasoning about occluded liquid.

模拟器是推理机器人与环境交互的强大工具。然而，当模拟与现实不同时，这种推理变得不那么有用。在本文中，我们展示了如何关闭液体模拟和实时感知之间的循环。在模拟器中跟踪液体的状态时，我们使用液体观察来纠正错误。我们的研究结果表明，闭环模拟是防止模拟液体和真实液体状态之间发生较大偏差的有效方法。作为这个直接的结果，我们的方法可以推理液体，否则由于大的分歧而导致液体不可行，例如关于封闭液体的推理。
