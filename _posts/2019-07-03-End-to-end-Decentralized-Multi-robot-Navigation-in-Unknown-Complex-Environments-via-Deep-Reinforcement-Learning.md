##### Abstract
In this paper, a novel deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based method is proposed to navigate the robot team through unknown complex environments, where the geometric centroid of the robot team aims to reach the goal position while avoiding collisions and maintaining connectivity. Decentralized robot-level policies are derived using a mechanism of centralized learning and decentralized executing. The proposed method can derive end-to-end policies, which map raw lidar measurements into velocity control commands of robots without the necessity of constructing obstacle maps. Simulation and indoor real-world unmanned ground vehicles (UGVs) experimental results verify the effectiveness of the proposed method.
