##### Abstract
We present MILABOT: a deep reinforcement learning chatbot developed by the Montreal Institute for Learning Algorithms (MILA) for the Amazon Alexa Prize competition. MILABOT is capable of conversing with humans on popular small talk topics through both speech and text. The system consists of an ensemble of natural language generation and retrieval models, including template-based models, bag-of-words models, sequence-to-sequence neural network and latent variable neural network models. By applying reinforcement learning to crowdsourced data and real-world user interactions, the system has been trained to select an appropriate response from the models in its ensemble. The system has been evaluated through A/B testing with real-world users, where it performed significantly better than many competing systems. Due to its machine learning architecture, the system is likely to improve with additional data.

我们提供MILABOT：一个由加拿大蒙特利尔学院算法（MILA）开发的深度强化学习聊天机器人。 MILABOT能够通过言语和文本与人类谈话。该系统由自然语言生成和检索模型组成，包括基于模板的模型，词袋模型，序列 - 序列神经网络和潜变量神经网络模型。通过将强化学习应用于众包的数据和真实的用户交互，系统已经被训练从其模型中选择合适的响应。该系统已通过A / B测试与真实世界的用户进行评估，其性能明显优于许多竞争系统。由于其机器学习架构，该系统可能会通过额外的数据进行改进。
