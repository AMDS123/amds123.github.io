##### Abstract
Soft computing approaches are mainly designed to address the real world ill-defined, imprecisely formulated problems, combining different kind of novel models of computation, such as neural networks, genetic algorithms (GAs. Handwritten digit recognition is a typical example of one such problem. In the current work we have developed a two-pass approach where the first pass classifier performs a coarse classification, based on some global features of the input pattern by restricting the possibility of classification decisions within a group of classes, smaller than the number of classes considered initially. In the second pass, the group specific classifiers concentrate on the features extracted from the selected local regions, and refine the earlier decision by combining the local and the global features for selecting the true class of the input pattern from the group of candidate classes selected in the first pass. To optimize the selection of local regions a GA based approach has been developed here. The maximum recognition performance on Bangla digit samples as achieved on the test set, during the first pass of the two pass approach is 93.35%. After combining the results of the two stage classifiers, an overall success rate of 95.25% is achieved.

软计算方法主要是针对现实世界不明确的，不精确的问题，结合不同种类的计算新模型，如神经网络，遗传算法（GAs），手写数字识别就是这样一个问题的典型例子。在目前的工作中，我们已经开发了一种双通道方法，其中第一遍分类器基于输入模式的一些全局特征执行粗分类，通过限制在一组类中的分类决定的可能性，小于类的数量在第二遍中，组特定分类器集中于从所选局部区域提取的特征，并且通过结合局部特征和全局特征来优化早先的判定，以从候选组中选择输入模式的真实类别为了优化当地的选择，基于遗传算法的方法有蜜蜂在这里发展。 Bangla数字样本在测试集上获得的最大识别性能，在两遍处理的第一遍中为93.35％。综合两阶段分类器的结果，总体成功率达到了95.25％。
