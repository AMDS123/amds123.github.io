##### Abstract
The degenerate four-wave mixing spectroscopy of uniaxially strained GaN layers is demonstrated using colinearly polarized laser pulses. The nonlinear response of FWM signal on exciton oscillator strength enhances the sensitivity for polarized exciton, allowing for mapping out the in-plane anisotropy of the strain field. The observed high-contrast spectral polarization clearly shows fine structure splittings of excitons, which are also confirmed in the change of quantum beating periods of time.
