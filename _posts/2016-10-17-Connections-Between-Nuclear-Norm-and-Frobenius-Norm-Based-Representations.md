##### Abstract
A lot of works have shown that frobenius-norm based representation (FNR) is competitive to sparse representation and nuclear-norm based representation (NNR) in numerous tasks such as subspace clustering. Despite the success of FNR in experimental studies, less theoretical analysis is provided to understand its working mechanism. In this paper, we fill this gap by building the theoretical connections between FNR and NNR. More specially, we prove that: 1) when the dictionary can provide enough representative capacity, FNR is exactly NNR even though the data set contains the Gaussian noise, Laplacian noise, or sample-specified corruption, 2) otherwise, FNR and NNR are two solutions on the column space of the dictionary.

##### Abstract (translated by Google)
大量的研究表明基于frobenius范数的表示（FNR）在稀疏表示和基于核范数的表示（NNR）等子空间聚类等众多任务中具有竞争力。尽管FNR在实验研究中取得了成功，但理论分析还不足以了解其工作机制。在本文中，我们通过建立FNR和NNR之间的理论联系来填补这个空白。更具体地说，我们证明：1）当字典能够提供足够的代表性能力时，即使数据集包含高斯噪声，拉普拉斯噪声或样本指定腐败，FNR仍然是NNR。2）否则，FNR和NNR是两个解决方案在字典的列空间。
