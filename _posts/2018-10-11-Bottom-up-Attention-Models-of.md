##### Abstract
In this review, we examine the recent progress in saliency prediction and proposed several avenues for future research. In spite of tremendous efforts and huge progress, there is still room for improvement in terms finer-grained analysis of deep saliency models, evaluation measures, datasets, annotation methods, cognitive studies, and new applications. This chapter will appear in Encyclopedia of Computational Neuroscience.
