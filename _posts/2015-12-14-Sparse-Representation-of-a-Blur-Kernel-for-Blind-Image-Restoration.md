##### Abstract
Blind image restoration is a non-convex problem which involves restoration of images from an unknown blur kernel. The factors affecting the performance of this restoration are how much prior information about an image and a blur kernel are provided and what algorithm is used to perform the restoration task. Prior information on images is often employed to restore the sharpness of the edges of an image. By contrast, no consensus is still present regarding what prior information to use in restoring from a blur kernel due to complex image blurring processes. In this paper, we propose modelling of a blur kernel as a sparse linear combinations of basic 2-D patterns. Our approach has a competitive edge over the existing blur kernel modelling methods because our method has the flexibility to customize the dictionary design, which makes it well-adaptive to a variety of applications. As a demonstration, we construct a dictionary formed by basic patterns derived from the Kronecker product of Gaussian sequences. We also compare our results with those derived by other state-of-the-art methods, in terms of peak signal to noise ratio (PSNR).

盲目图像恢复是一个非凸问题，它涉及从未知的模糊核心恢复图像。影响该恢复性能的因素是提供了多少关于图像和模糊内核的先验信息，以及使用什么算法来执行恢复任务。通常采用先前的图像信息来恢复图像边缘的清晰度。相比之下，由于复杂的图像模糊过程，还没有关于从模糊核恢复使用什么先验信息的共识。在本文中，我们提出了一个模糊核的建模作为基本的二维模式的稀疏线性组合。我们的方法比现有的模糊内核建模方法具有竞争优势，因为我们的方法具有定制字典设计的灵活性，这使得它适用于各种应用程序。作为一个例子，我们构造了一个由高斯序列的Kronecker乘积导出的基本模式形成的字典。就峰值信噪比（PSNR）而言，我们还将我们的结果与其他最先进方法所得结果进行比较。
