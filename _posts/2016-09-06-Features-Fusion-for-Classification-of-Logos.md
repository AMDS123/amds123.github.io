##### Abstract
In this paper, a logo classification system based on the appearance of logo images is proposed. The proposed classification system makes use of global characteristics of logo images for classification. Color, texture, and shape of a logo wholly describe the global characteristics of logo images. The various combinations of these characteristics are used for classification. The combination contains only with single feature or with fusion of two features or fusion of all three features considered at a time respectively. Further, the system categorizes the logo image into: a logo image with fully text or with fully symbols or containing both symbols and texts.. The K-Nearest Neighbour (K-NN) classifier is used for classification. Due to the lack of color logo image dataset in the literature, the same is created consisting 5044 color logo images. Finally, the performance of the classification system is evaluated through accuracy, precision, recall and F-measure computed from the confusion matrix. The experimental results show that the most promising results are obtained for fusion of features.

本文提出了一种基于标志图像外观的标志分类系统。提出的分类系统利用标志图像的全局特征进行分类。标志的颜色，纹理和形状完全描述了标志图像的全球特征。这些特征的各种组合被用于分类。该组合仅包含单个特征或两个特征的融合或者一次考虑的所有三个特征的融合。此外，系统将标识图像分类为：具有完全文本或完全符号或包含符号和文本的标识图像.K-最近邻（K-NN）分类器用于分类。由于文献中缺乏彩色标志图像数据集，所以创建了5044个彩色标志图像。最后，通过从混淆矩阵中计算出的准确度，精度，召回率和F-measure来评估分类系统的性能。实验结果表明，最有希望的结果是获得的功能融合。
