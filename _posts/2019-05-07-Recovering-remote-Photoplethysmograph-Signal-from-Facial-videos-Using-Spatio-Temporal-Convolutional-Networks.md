##### Abstract
Recently average heart rate (HR) can be measured relatively accurately from human face videos based on non-contact remote photoplethysmography (rPPG). However in many healthcare applications, knowing only the average HR is not enough, and measured blood volume pulse signal and its heart rate variability (HRV) features are also important. We propose the first end-to-end rPPG signal recovering system (PhysNet) using deep spatio-temporal convolutional networks to measure both HR and HRV features. PhysNet extracts the spatial and temporal hidden features simultaneously from raw face sequences while outputs the corresponding rPPG signal directly. The temporal context information helps the network learn more robust features with less fluctuation. Our approach was tested on two datasets, and achieved superior performance of HR and HRV features comparing to the state-of-the-art methods.
