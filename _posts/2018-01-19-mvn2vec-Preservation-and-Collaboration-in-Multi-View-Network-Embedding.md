##### Abstract
Multi-view networks are ubiquitous in real-world applications. In order to extract knowledge or business value, it is of interest to transform such networks into representations that are easily machine-actionable. Meanwhile, network embedding has emerged as an effective approach to generate distributed network representations. Therefore, we are motivated to study the problem of multi-view network embedding, with a focus on the characteristics that are specific and important in embedding this type of networks. In our practice of embedding real-world multi-view networks, we identify two such characteristics, which we refer to as preservation and collaboration. We then explore the feasibility of achieving better embedding quality by simultaneously modeling preservation and collaboration, and propose the mvn2vec algorithms. With experiments on a series of synthetic datasets, an internal Snapchat dataset, and two public datasets, we further confirm the presence and importance of preservation and collaboration. These experiments also demonstrate that better embedding can be obtained by simultaneously modeling the two characteristics, while not over-complicating the model or requiring additional supervision.

多视点网络在真实世界的应用中无处不在。为了提取知识或业务价值，将这种网络转换成易于机器操作的表示是有意义的。同时，网络嵌入已经成为生成分布式网络表示的一种有效方法。因此，我们有必要研究多视图网络嵌入问题，着重介绍嵌入这种网络的特点和重要性。在我们嵌入实际的多视图网络的实践中，我们确定了两个这样的特征，我们称之为保存和协作。然后我们探讨通过同时建模保存和协作来实现更好的嵌入质量的可行性，并提出mvn2vec算法。通过对一系列合成数据集，内部Snapchat数据集和两个公共数据集的实验，我们进一步确认了保存和协作的存在和重要性。这些实验还表明，通过同时建模两个特性可以获得更好的嵌入，同时不会使模型过度复杂或需要额外的监督。
