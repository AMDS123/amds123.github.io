##### Abstract
Web-based technology has improved drastically in the past decade. As a result, security technology has become a major help to protect our daily life. In this paper, we propose a robust security based on face recognition system (SoF). In particular, we develop this system to giving access into a home for authenticated users. The classifier is trained by using a new adaptive learning method. The training data are initially collected from social networks. The accuracy of the classifier is incrementally improved as the user starts using the system. A novel method has been introduced to improve the classifier model by human interaction and social media. By using a deep learning framework - TensorFlow, it will be easy to reuse the framework to adopt with many devices and applications.
