##### Abstract
Image splicing detection is of fundamental importance in digital forensics and therefore has attracted increasing attention recently. In this paper, a color image splicing detection approach is proposed based on Markov transition probability of quaternion component separation in quaternion discrete cosine transform (QDCT) domain and quaternion wavelet transform (QWT) domain. Firstly, Markov features of the intra-block and inter-block between block QDCT coefficients are obtained from the real part and three imaginary parts of QDCT coefficients respectively. Then, additional Markov features are extracted from luminance (Y) channel in quaternion wavelet transform domain to characterize the dependency of position among quaternion wavelet subband coefficients. Finally, ensemble classifier (EC) is exploited to classify the spliced and authentic color images. The experiment results demonstrate that the proposed approach can outperforms some state-of-the-art methods.

##### Abstract (translated by Google)
图像拼接检测在数字取证中具有根本的重要性，近年来受到越来越多的关注。本文提出了一种基于四元数离散余弦变换（QDCT）域和四元数小波变换（QWT）域中四元数分离马尔可夫转移概率的彩色图像拼接检测方法。首先，分别从QDCT系数的实部和三个虚部中获得块QDCT系数之间的块内和块间马尔可夫特征。然后，从四元数小波变换域的亮度（Y）通道中提取附加马尔可夫特征，以表征四元数小波子带系数之间的位置依赖关系。最后，集合分类器（EC）被用来分类拼接和真实的彩色图像。实验结果表明，提出的方法可以胜过一些最先进的方法。
