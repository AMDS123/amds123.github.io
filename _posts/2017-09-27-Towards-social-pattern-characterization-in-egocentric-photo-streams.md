##### Abstract
Following the increasingly popular trend of social interaction analysis in egocentric vision, this manuscript proposes a new pipeline for automatic social pattern characterization of a wearable photo-camera user, relying on visual analysis of captured egocentric photos. The proposed framework consists of three major steps. The first step is dedicated to social interaction detection where the impact of several social signals is explored. Detected social events are inspected in the second step for categorization into different social meetings. These two steps act at event-level where each potential social event is modeled as a multi-dimensional time-series, whose dimensions correspond to a set of relevant features for each task, and LSTM is employed for time-series classification. The last step of the framework corresponds to the social pattern characterization of the user, where recurrences of the same person across the whole set of social events of the user are clustered to achieve a comprehensive understanding of the diversity and frequency of the social relations of the user. Experimental evaluation over a dataset acquired by a user wearing a photo-camera during a month demonstrates the relevance of the considered features for social interaction analysis, and show promising results on the task of social pattern characterization from egocentric photo-streams.

##### Abstract (translated by Google)
随着越来越流行的以自我为中心的社会交往分析趋势，这篇文章提出了一种新的可穿戴摄影机用户自动社交模式表征的流水线，依靠对拍摄的自我中心照片的视觉分析。拟议框架包括三个主要步骤。第一步是致力于探索社交信号的影响。检测到的社交活动在第二步被检查分类到不同的社交会议。这两个步骤在事件级别进行，其中每个潜在社交事件被建模为多维时间序列，其维度对应于每个任务的一组相关特征，并且LSTM被用于时间序列分类。框架的最后一步对应于用户的社交模式特征，其中用户的整个一组社交事件中同一个人的复发被聚类以实现对社交关系的多样性和频率的全面理解用户。在一个月内用户佩戴照相机获取的数据集的实验评估证明了所考虑的社交相互作用分析的特征的相关性，并且显示了从以自我中心照片流为特征的社交模式表征方面的有希望的结果。
