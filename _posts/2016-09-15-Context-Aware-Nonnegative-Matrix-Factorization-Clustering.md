##### Abstract
In this article we propose a method to refine the clustering results obtained with the nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) technique, imposing consistency constraints on the final labeling of the data. The research community focused its effort on the initialization and on the optimization part of this method, without paying attention to the final cluster assignments. We propose a game theoretic framework in which each object to be clustered is represented as a player, which has to choose its cluster membership. The information obtained with NMF is used to initialize the strategy space of the players and a weighted graph is used to model the interactions among the players. These interactions allow the players to choose a cluster which is coherent with the clusters chosen by similar players, a property which is not guaranteed by NMF, since it produces a soft clustering of the data. The results on common benchmarks show that our model is able to improve the performances of many NMF formulations.

在这篇文章中，我们提出了一种方法来优化非负矩阵分解（NMF）技术获得的聚类结果，强加数据的最终标签的一致性约束。研究团体将精力集中在初始化和该方法的优化部分上，而不关注最终的集群分配。我们提出了一个游戏理论框架，其中每个要聚类的对象被表示为一个玩家，它必须选择它的聚类成员。使用NMF获得的信息用于初始化玩家的策略空间，并且使用加权图来模拟玩家之间的交互。这些相互作用允许玩家选择与类似玩家选择的类群相一致的类群，这是NMF不能保证的属性，因为它产生了数据的软聚类。通用基准的结果表明，我们的模型能够改善许多NMF配方的性能。
