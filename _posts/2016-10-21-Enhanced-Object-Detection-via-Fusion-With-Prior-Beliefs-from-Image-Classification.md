##### Abstract
In this paper, we introduce a novel fusion method that can enhance object detection performance by fusing decisions from two different types of computer vision tasks: object detection and image classification. In the proposed work, the class label of an image obtained from image classification is viewed as prior knowledge about existence or non-existence of certain objects. The prior knowledge is then fused with the decisions of object detection to improve detection accuracy by mitigating false positives of an object detector that are strongly contradicted with the prior knowledge. A recently introduced novel fusion approach called dynamic belief fusion (DBF) is used to fuse the detector output with the classification prior. Experimental results show that the detection performance of all the detection algorithms used in the proposed work is improved on benchmark datasets via the proposed fusion framework.
