##### Abstract
Recent years have witnessed great success of convolutional neural network (CNN) for various problems both in low and high level visions. Especially noteworthy is the residual network which was originally proposed to handle high-level vision problems and enjoys several merits. This paper aims to extend the merits of residual network, such as skip connection induced fast training, for a typical low-level vision problem, i.e., single image super-resolution. In general, the two main challenges of existing deep CNN for supper-resolution lie in the gradient exploding/vanishing problem and large numbers of parameters or computational cost as CNN goes deeper. Correspondingly, the skip connections or identity mapping shortcuts are utilized to avoid gradient exploding/vanishing problem. In addition, the skip connections have naturally centered the activation which led to better performance. To tackle with the second problem, a lightweight CNN architecture which has carefully designed width, depth and skip connections was proposed. In particular, a strategy of gradually varying the shape of network has been proposed for residual network. Different residual architectures for image super-resolution have also been compared. Experimental results have demonstrated that the proposed CNN model can not only achieve state-of-the-art PSNR and SSIM results for single image super-resolution but also produce visually pleasant results. This paper has extended the mmm 2017 oral conference paper with a considerable new analyses and more experiments especially from the perspective of centering activations and ensemble behaviors of residual network.

##### Abstract (translated by Google)
近年来，卷积神经网络（CNN）在低层和高层的各种问题上都取得了巨大的成功。尤其值得一提的是最初提出的处理高层次视觉问题的残留网络，具有多项优点。针对典型的低层次视觉问题，即单幅图像超分辨率问题，本文旨在扩展残差网络的优点，如跳跃连接引起的快速训练。一般来说，现有的深度CNN超高分辨率的两个主要挑战在于梯度爆炸/消失问题和CNN深入的大量参数或计算成本。相应地，跳过连接或身份映射快捷键被用来避免梯度爆炸/消失问题。另外，跳过连接自然地集中了导致更好性能的激活。为解决第二个问题，提出了一种精心设计宽度，深度和跳跃连接的轻量级CNN架构。具体而言，针对残留网络提出了逐渐改变网络形状的策略。还对图像超分辨率的不同残余体系结构进行了比较。实验结果表明，所提出的CNN模型不仅可以获得单幅图像超分辨率的最新PSNR和SSIM结果，而且可以产生视觉上令人满意的结果。特别是从残差网络集中激活和集合行为的角度出发，本文延长了2017年度口头会议论文的研究范围。
