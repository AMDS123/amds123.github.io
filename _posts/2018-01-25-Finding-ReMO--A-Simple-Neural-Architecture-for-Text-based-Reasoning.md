##### Abstract
To solve the text-based question and answering task that requires relational reasoning, it is necessary to memorize a large amount of information and find out the question relevant information from the memory. Most approaches were based on external memory and four components proposed by Memory Network. The distinctive component among them was the way of finding the necessary information and it contributes to the performance. Recently, a simple but powerful neural network module for reasoning called Relation Network (RN) has been introduced. We analyzed RN from the view of Memory Network, and realized that its MLP component is able to reveal the complicate relation between question and object pair. Motivated from it, we introduce which uses MLP to find out relevant information on Memory Network architecture. It shows new state-of-the-art results in jointly trained bAbI-10k story-based question answering tasks and bAbI dialog-based question answering tasks.

为了解决需要关系推理的基于文本的问题和回答任务，需要记忆大量的信息，并从存储器中找出问题的相关信息。大多数方法都是基于外部存储器和由内存网络提出的四个组件。其中独特的组成部分是找到必要信息的方式，并有助于表现。最近，引入了一种简单但功能强大的称为关系网（RN）的推理神经网络模块。我们从记忆网络的角度分析了RN，并且认识到它的MLP组件能够揭示问题与对象之间的复杂关系。受其启发，我们介绍使用MLP来查找内存网络体系结构的相关信息。它展示了在联合训练的bAbI-10k基于故事的问题回答任务和基于bAbI对话框的问题回答任务中最新的最新成果。
