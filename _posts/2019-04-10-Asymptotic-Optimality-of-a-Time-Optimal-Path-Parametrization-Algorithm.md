##### Abstract
Time Optimal Path Parametrization is the problem of minimizing the time interval during which an actuation constrained agent can traverse a given path. Recently, an efficient linear-time algorithm for solving this problem was proposed. However, its optimality was proved for only a strict subclass of problems solved optimally by more computationally intensive approaches based on convex programming. In this paper, we prove that the same linear-time algorithm is asymptotically optimal for all problems solved optimally by convex optimization approaches. We also characterize the optimum of the Time Optimal Path Parametrization Problem, which may be of independent interest.
