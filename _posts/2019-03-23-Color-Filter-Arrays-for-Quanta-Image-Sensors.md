##### Abstract
Quanta image sensor (QIS) is to be the next generation image sensor after CCD and CMOS. To enable such technology, significant progress was made over the past five years to advance both the device and image reconstruction algorithms. In this paper, we discuss color imaging using QIS, in particular how to design color filter arrays. Designing color filter arrays for QIS is challenging because at the pixel pitch of 1.1$\mu$m, maximizing the light efficiency while suppressing aliasing and crosstalk are conflicting tasks. We present an optimization-based framework to design color filter arrays for very small pixels. The new framework unifies several mainstream color filter array design frameworks by offering generality and flexibility. Compared to the existing frameworks which can only handle one or two design criteria, the new framework can simultaneously handle luminance gain, chrominance gain, cross-talk, anti-aliasing, manufacturability and orthogonality. Extensive experimental comparisons demonstrate the effectiveness and generality of the framework.
