##### Abstract
Accurate demand forecasts can help on-line retail organizations better plan their supply-chain processes. The challenge, however, is the large number of associative factors that result in large, non-stationary shifts in demand, which traditional time series and regression approaches fail to model. In this paper, we propose a Neural Network architecture called AR-MDN, that simultaneously models associative factors, time-series trends and the variance in the demand. We first identify several causal features and use a combination of feature embeddings, MLP and LSTM to represent them. We then model the output density as a learned mixture of Gaussian distributions. The AR-MDN can be trained end-to-end without the need for additional supervision. We experiment on a dataset of an year's worth of data over tens-of-thousands of products from Flipkart. The proposed architecture yields a significant improvement in forecasting accuracy when compared with existing alternatives.

准确的需求预测可以帮助在线零售机构更好地规划他们的供应链流程。然而，挑战在于大量的关联因素导致需求出现大的非平稳变化，传统的时间序列和回归方法无法建模。在本文中，我们提出了称为AR-MDN的神经网络体系结构，它同时为关联因素，时间序列趋势和需求方差建模。我们首先确定几个因果特征，并结合使用特征嵌入MLP和LSTM来表示它们。然后，我们将输出密度建模为高斯分布的学习混合。 AR-MDN可以进行端对端培训，无需额外的监督。我们在Flipkart的数以万计的产品上测试一年数据的数据集。与现有替代方案相比，所提出的架构在预测准确性方面产生了重大改进。
