##### Abstract
To bridge the gap between Machine Reading Comprehension (MRC) models and human beings, which is mainly reflected in the hunger for data and the robustness to noise, in this paper, we explore how to integrate the neural networks of MRC models with the general knowledge of human beings. On the one hand, we propose a data enrichment method, which uses WordNet to extract inter-word semantic connections as general knowledge from each given passage-question pair. On the other hand, we propose a new MRC model named as Knowledge Aided Reader (KAR), which explicitly utilizes the above extracted general knowledge in its attention mechanisms. Based on the data enrichment method, KAR is comparable in performance with the state-of-the-art MRC models and significantly more robust to noise than them. Besides, when only a subset (20% - 80%) of the training examples are available, KAR outperforms the state-of-the-art MRC models by a large margin and is still fairly robust to noise.
