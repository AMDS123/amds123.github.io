##### Abstract
We introduce a novel method to obtain high-quality 3D reconstructions from consumer RGB-D sensors. Our core idea is to simultaneously optimize for geometry encoded in a signed distance field (SDF), textures from automatically-selected keyframes, and their camera poses along with material and scene lighting. To this end, we propose a joint surface reconstruction approach that is based on Shape-from-Shading (SfS) techniques and utilizes the estimation of spatially-varying spherical harmonics (SVSH) from subvolumes of the reconstructed scene. Through extensive examples and evaluations, we demonstrate that our method dramatically increases the level of detail in the reconstructed scene geometry and contributes highly to consistent surface texture recovery.

我们引入一种新的方法来从消费者RGB-D传感器获得高质量的3D重建。我们的核心思想是同时优化在带符号距离场（SDF）中编码的几何图形，自动选择的关键帧的纹理以及相机姿态以及材质和场景照明。为此，我们提出了一种基于Shape-from-Shading（SfS）技术的联合曲面重建方法，并利用重构场景的子体积中的空间变化球面谐波（SVSH）的估计。通过广泛的实例和评估，我们证明了我们的方法大大提高了重建场景几何中的细节水平，并且对一致的表面纹理恢复做出了极大的贡献。
