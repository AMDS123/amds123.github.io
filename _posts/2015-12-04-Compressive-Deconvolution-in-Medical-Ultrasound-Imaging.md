##### Abstract
The interest of compressive sampling in ultrasound imaging has been recently extensively evaluated by several research teams. Following the different application setups, it has been shown that the RF data may be reconstructed from a small number of measurements and/or using a reduced number of ultrasound pulse emissions. Nevertheless, RF image spatial resolution, contrast and signal to noise ratio are affected by the limited bandwidth of the imaging transducer and the physical phenomenon related to US wave propagation. To overcome these limitations, several deconvolution-based image processing techniques have been proposed to enhance the ultrasound images. In this paper, we propose a novel framework, named compressive deconvolution, that reconstructs enhanced RF images from compressed measurements. Exploiting an unified formulation of the direct acquisition model, combining random projections and 2D convolution with a spatially invariant point spread function, the benefit of our approach is the joint data volume reduction and image quality improvement. The proposed optimization method, based on the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers, is evaluated on both simulated and in vivo data.

超声成像中压缩采样的兴趣最近已被多个研究小组广泛评估。在不同的应用设置之后，已经示出可以从少量测量和/或使用减少数量的超声波脉冲发射来重建RF数据。然而，RF图像的空间分辨率，对比度和信噪比受成像换能器的有限带宽以及与US波传播相关的物理现象的影响。为了克服这些限制，已经提出了几种基于解卷积的图像处理技术来增强超声图像。在本文中，我们提出了一个新的框架，称为压缩反卷积，重建从压缩测量增强的射频图像。利用直接采集模型的统一公式，结合随机投影和二维卷积与空间不变点扩散函数，我们的方法的好处是联合数据量的减少和图像质量的提高。所提出的基于乘子交替方向法的优化方法在模拟和体内数据上都被评估。
