##### Abstract
In this work we propose a methodology for an automatic food classification system which recognizes the contents of the meal from the images of the food. We developed a multi-layered deep convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture that takes advantages of the features from other deep networks and improves the efficiency. Numerous classical handcrafted features and approaches are explored, among which CNNs are chosen as the best performing features. Networks are trained and fine-tuned using preprocessed images and the filter outputs are fused to achieve higher accuracy. Experimental results on the largest real-world food recognition database ETH Food-101 and newly contributed Indian food image database demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methodology as compared to many other benchmark deep learned CNN frameworks.

在这项工作中，我们提出了一种自动食品分类系统的方法，从食物图像中识别膳食的内容。我们开发了一种多层深度卷积神经网络（CNN）架构，利用其他深层网络的特点，提高效率。探索了许多经典的手工特征和方法，其中CNN被选为最佳表现特征。使用预处理的图像对网络进行训练和微调，滤波器输出被融合以实现更高的精度。最大的真实世界的食物识别数据库ETH Food-101和新近提供的印度食物图像数据库的实验结果表明，与许多其他基准深度学习的CNN框架相比，所提出方法的有效性。
