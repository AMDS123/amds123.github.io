##### Abstract
We present an adaptive imaging technique that optically computes a low-rank representation of a scene's hyperspectral image. The proposed imager, KRISM, provides optical implementation of two operators on the scene's hyperspectral image: a spectrally-coded spatial measurement and a spatially-coded spectral measurement. By iterating between the two operators, using the output of one as the input to the other, we show that the top singular vectors and singular values of a hyperspectral image can be computed in the optical domain with only a few measurements. We present an optical design that uses pupil plane coding for implementing the two operations and show several compelling results using a lab prototype to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed hyperspectral imager.
