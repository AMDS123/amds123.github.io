##### Abstract
FrameNet is a computational linguistics resource composed of semantic frames, high-level concepts that represent the meanings of words. In this paper, we present an approach to gather frame disambiguation annotations in sentences using a crowdsourcing approach with multiple workers per sentence to capture inter-annotator disagreement. We perform an experiment over a set of 433 sentences annotated with frames from the FrameNet corpus, and show that the aggregated crowd annotations achieve an F1 score greater than 0.67 as compared to expert linguists. We highlight cases where the crowd annotation was correct even though the expert is in disagreement, arguing for the need to have multiple annotators per sentence. Most importantly, we examine cases in which crowd workers could not agree, and demonstrate that these cases exhibit ambiguity, either in the sentence, frame, or the task itself, and argue that collapsing such cases to a single, discrete truth value (i.e. correct or incorrect) is inappropriate, creating arbitrary targets for machine learning.

FrameNet是一个计算语言学资源，由语义框架和代表单词含义的高级概念组成。在本文中，我们提出了一个方法来收集框架消歧注释句子使用众包方法与多个工人每句话捕获注释员之间的分歧。我们对一组433个句子进行了实验，这些句子用FrameNet语料库中的帧进行了注释，并显示与专家语言学家相比，聚合人群注释的F1得分大于0.67。我们强调即使专家意见不一致，人群注释是正确的，并争辩每个句子需要多个注释者。最重要的是，我们研究了群众工作人员不同意的案例，并且证明这些案例在句子，框架或任务本身中表现出模糊性，并且认为将这些案例分解为单一的离散真值（即正确或不正确的）是不恰当的，从而为机器学习创建任意目标。
