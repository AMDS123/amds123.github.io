##### Abstract
Deep learning models are now used in many different industries, while in certain domains safety is not a critical issue in the medical field it is a huge concern. Not only, we want the models to generalize well but we also want to know the models confidence respect to its decision and which features matter the most. Our team aims to develop a full pipeline in which not only displays the uncertainty of the models decision but also, the saliency map to show which sets of pixels of the input image contribute most to the predictions.
