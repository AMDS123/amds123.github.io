##### Abstract
Neural Machine Translation (NMT) has become the new state-of-the-art in several language pairs. However, it remains a challenging problem how to integrate NMT with a bilingual dictionary which mainly contains words rarely or never seen in the bilingual training data. In this paper, we propose two methods to bridge NMT and the bilingual dictionaries. The core idea behind is to design novel models that transform the bilingual dictionaries into adequate sentence pairs, so that NMT can distil latent bilingual mappings from the ample and repetitive phenomena. One method leverages a mixed word/character model and the other attempts at synthesizing parallel sentences guaranteeing massive occurrence of the translation lexicon. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed methods can remarkably improve the translation quality, and most of the rare words in the test sentences can obtain correct translations if they are covered by the dictionary.

神经机器翻译（NMT）已经成为几种语言对中的新型先进技术。然而，如何将NMT与主要包含双语训练数据中很少或从未见过的单词的双语词典进行整合仍然是一个具有挑战性的问题。在本文中，我们提出两种方法来衔接NMT和双语词典。其核心思想是设计将双语词典转化为适当的句对的新模式，使NMT能够从潜在的双重映射中挖掘出潜在的双重映射。一种方法利用混合词/字符模型，另一种方法是合成平行句子，保证翻译词典的大量出现。大量的实验表明，所提出的方法可以显着提高翻译质量，如果被测试语句覆盖，测试语句中的大部分稀有词汇都可以得到正确的翻译结果。
