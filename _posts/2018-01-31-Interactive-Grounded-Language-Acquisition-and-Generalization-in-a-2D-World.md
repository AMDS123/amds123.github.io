##### Abstract
We build a virtual agent for learning language in a 2D maze-like world. The agent sees images of the surrounding environment, listens to a virtual teacher, and takes actions to receive rewards. It interactively learns the teacher's language from scratch based on two language use cases: sentence-directed navigation and question answering. It learns simultaneously the visual representations of the world, the language, and the action control. By disentangling language grounding from other computational routines and sharing a concept detection function between language grounding and prediction, the agent reliably interpolates and extrapolates to interpret sentences that contain new word combinations or new words missing from training sentences. The new words are transferred from the answers of language prediction. Such a language ability is trained and evaluated on a population of over 1.6 million distinct sentences consisting of 119 object words, 8 color words, 9 spatial-relation words, and 50 grammatical words. The proposed model significantly outperforms five comparison methods for interpreting zero-shot sentences. In addition, we demonstrate human-interpretable intermediate outputs of the model in the appendix.

##### Abstract (translated by Google)
我们在2D迷宫般的世界里建立一个虚拟代理来学习语言。代理人看到周围环境的图像，听虚拟教师，并采取行动来获得奖励。它基于两种语言使用案例：句子导航和问题回答，从头开始交互式地学习教师的语言。它同时学习世界的视觉表征，语言和行动控制。通过从其他计算例程中解开语言基础，共享语言基础和预测之间的概念检测功能，代理可靠地内插和外推以解释包含新词组合或者训练语句中缺失的新词语的句子。新的单词是从语言预测的答案转移而来的。这种语言能力是由超过160万个由119个对象词，8个颜色词，9个空间关系词和50个语法词构成的不同句子的人群进行训练和评估的。所提出的模型明显优于五种解释零点句子的比较方法。另外，我们在附录中演示模型的人类可解释的中间输出。
