##### Abstract
Gesture recognition is a very essential technology for many wearable devices. While previous algorithms are mostly based on statistical methods including the hidden Markov model, we develop two dynamic hand gesture recognition techniques using low complexity recurrent neural network (RNN) algorithms. One is based on video signal and employs a combined structure of a convolutional neural network (CNN) and an RNN. The other uses accelerometer data and only requires an RNN. Fixed-point optimization that quantizes most of the weights into two bits is conducted to optimize the amount of memory size for weight storage and reduce the power consumption in hardware and software based implementations.

手势识别对于许多可穿戴设备来说是非常重要的技术。虽然以前的算法主要基于包括隐马尔可夫模型在内的统计方法，但是我们使用低复杂度递归神经网络（RNN）算法开发了两种动态手势识别技术。一种是基于视频信号并采用卷积神经网络（CNN）和RNN的组合结构。另一个使用加速计数据，只需要一个RNN。将大部分权重量化为两位的定点优化是为了优化重量存储的内存大小，并降低基于硬件和软件的实现中的功耗。
