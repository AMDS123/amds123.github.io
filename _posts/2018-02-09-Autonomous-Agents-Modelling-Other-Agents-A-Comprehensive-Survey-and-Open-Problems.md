##### Abstract
Much research in artificial intelligence is concerned with the development of autonomous agents that can interact effectively with other agents. An important aspect of such agents is the ability to reason about the behaviours of other agents, by constructing models which make predictions about various properties of interest (such as actions, goals, beliefs) of the modelled agents. A variety of modelling approaches now exist which vary widely in their methodology and underlying assumptions, catering to the needs of the different sub-communities within which they were developed and reflecting the different practical uses for which they are intended. The purpose of the present article is to provide a comprehensive survey of the salient modelling methods which can be found in the literature. The article concludes with a discussion of open problems which may form the basis for fruitful future research.

##### Abstract (translated by Google)
对人工智能的大量研究涉及与其他智能体进行有效交互的自治智能体的开发。这样的代理人的一个重要方面是通过构建模型来推理其他代理人的行为的能力，这些模型对所建模代理人的各种兴趣属性（如行为，目标，信念）进行预测。现在存在着各种各样的建模方法，其方法和基本假设有很大差异，迎合了它们开发的不同次级社区的需求，并反映了它们所针对的不同的实际用途。本文的目的是对文献中可以找到的主要建模方法进行全面的调查。文章最后讨论了可能构成未来有成果研究基础的未决问题。
