##### Abstract
Supervised machine learning based state-of-the-art computer vision techniques are in general data hungry and pose the challenges of not having adequate computing resources and of high costs involved in human labeling efforts. Training data subset selection and active learning techniques have been proposed as possible solutions to these challenges respectively. A special class of subset selection functions naturally model notions of diversity, coverage and representation and they can be used to eliminate redundancy and thus lend themselves well for training data subset selection. They can also help improve the efficiency of active learning in further reducing human labeling efforts by selecting a subset of the examples obtained using the conventional uncertainty sampling based techniques. In this work we empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of two diversity models, namely the Facility-Location and Disparity-Min models for training-data subset selection and reducing labeling effort. We do this for a variety of computer vision tasks including Gender Recognition, Scene Recognition and Object Recognition. Our results show that subset selection done in the right way can add 2-3% in accuracy on existing baselines, particularly in the case of less training data. This allows the training of complex machine learning models (like Convolutional Neural Networks) with much less training data while incurring minimal performance loss.

基于最先进的计算机视觉技术的受监督的机器学习通常是数据饥饿的，并且带来了没有足够的计算资源以及涉及人类标签工作的高成本的挑战。已经提出了训练数据子集选择和主动学习技术作为分别针对这些挑战的可能解决方案。一类特殊的子集选择函数自然地模拟了多样性，覆盖和表示的概念，它们可以用来消除冗余，因此适合训练数据子集的选择。他们还可以帮助提高主动学习的效率，从而通过选择使用基于常规不确定性采样技术获得的示例的子集来进一步减少人类标注工作。在这项工作中，我们凭经验论证了两种多样性模型的有效性，即Facility-Location和Disparity-Min模型用于训练数据子集选择和减少标记工作。我们为各种计算机视觉任务执行此操作，包括性别识别，场景识别和对象识别。我们的研究结果表明，以正确方式完成的子集选择可以在现有基线上增加2-3％的准确度，特别是在培训数据较少的情况下。这允许训练复杂的机器学习模型（如卷积神经网络），训练数据少得多，而性能损失最小。
