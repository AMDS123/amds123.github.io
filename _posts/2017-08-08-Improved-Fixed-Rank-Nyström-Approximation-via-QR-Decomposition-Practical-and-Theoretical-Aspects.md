##### Abstract
The Nystr\"om method is a popular technique for computing fixed-rank approximations of large kernel matrices using a small number of landmark points. In practice, to ensure high quality approximations, the number of landmark points is chosen to be greater than the target rank. However, the standard Nystr\"om method uses a sub-optimal procedure for rank reduction mainly due to its simplicity. In this paper, we highlight the drawbacks of standard Nystr\"om in terms of poor performance and lack of theoretical guarantees. To address these issues, we present an efficient method for generating improved fixed-rank Nystr\"om approximations. Theoretical analysis and numerical experiments are provided to demonstrate the advantages of the modified method over the standard Nystr\"om method. Overall, the aim of this paper is to convince researchers to use the modified method, as it has nearly identical computational complexity, is easy to code, and has greatly improved accuracy in many cases.

Nystrom方法是一种常用的计算大型核矩阵的固定秩近似的方法，实际上为了保证高质量的近似，选择的界标点的数量大于目标但是，标准的Nystrom方法主要由于其简单性而使用次优的程序来降低等级。为了解决这些问题，我们提出了一种生成改进的固定秩Nystr'近似的有效方法。理论分析和数值实验证明了改进方法优于标准Nystrom方法的优点。总的来说，本文的目的是说服研究人员使用改进的方法，因为它具有几乎相同的计算复杂度，易于编码，并且在许多情况下已经大大提高了准确度。
