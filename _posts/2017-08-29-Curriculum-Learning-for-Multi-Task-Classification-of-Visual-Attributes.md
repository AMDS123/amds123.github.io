##### Abstract
Visual attributes, from simple objects (e.g., backpacks, hats) to soft-biometrics (e.g., gender, height, clothing) have proven to be a powerful representational approach for many applications such as image description and human identification. In this paper, we introduce a novel method to combine the advantages of both multi-task and curriculum learning in a visual attribute classification framework. Individual tasks are grouped based on their correlation so that two groups of strongly and weakly correlated tasks are formed. The two groups of tasks are learned in a curriculum learning setup by transferring the acquired knowledge from the strongly to the weakly correlated. The learning process within each group though, is performed in a multi-task classification setup. The proposed method learns better and converges faster than learning all the tasks in a typical multi-task learning paradigm. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on the publicly available, SoBiR, VIPeR and PETA datasets and report state-of-the-art results across the board.

从简单的物体（例如背包，帽子）到软生物特征（例如性别，身高，衣服）的视觉属性已被证明是许多应用（例如图像描述和人类识别）的强有力的代表性方法。在本文中，我们引入了一种将多任务和课程学习的优点结合在一个视觉属性分类框架中的新方法。个别任务根据其相关性分组，从而形成两组强弱相关的任务。这两组任务是在课程学习设置中学习，将获得的知识从强有力转移到弱相关。但是，每个组内的学习过程都是在多任务分类设置中执行的。所提出的方法比学习典型的多任务学习范例中的所有任务更好地学习和收敛得更快。我们展示了我们的方法在公开可用的SoBiR，VIPeR和PETA数据集上的有效性，并报告了全面的最新结果。
