##### Abstract
Artificial intelligence recently had a great advancements caused by the emergence of new processing power and machine learning methods. Having said that, the learning capability of artificial intelligence is still at its infancy comparing to the learning capability of human and many animals. Many of the current artificial intelligence applications can only operate in a very orchestrated, specific environments with an extensive training set that exactly describes the conditions that will occur during execution time. Having that in mind, and considering the several existing machine learning methods this question rises that 'What are some of the best ways for a machine to learn?' Regarding the learning methods of human, Confucius' point of view is that they are by experience, imitation and reflection. This paper tries to explore and discuss regarding these three ways of learning and their implementations in machines by having a look at how they happen in minds.

最近人工智能因新的处理能力和机器学习方法的出现而取得了很大的进步。话虽如此，与人类和许多动物的学习能力相比，人工智能的学习能力仍处于起步阶段。许多当前的人工智能应用程序只能在非常精心策划的特定环境中运行，并且具有完整描述执行期间将发生的条件的广泛训练集。考虑到这一点，并考虑到现有的几种机器学习方法，这个问题就出现了“机器学习的最佳方法是什么？”关于人的学习方法，孔子的观点是他们是经验，模仿和反思。本文试图通过研究它们在脑海中的发生方式，探讨和讨论这三种学习方式及其在机器中的实现。
