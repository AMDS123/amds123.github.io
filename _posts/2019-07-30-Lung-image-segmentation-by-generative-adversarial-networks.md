##### Abstract
Lung image segmentation plays an important role in computer-aid pulmonary diseases diagnosis and treatment. This paper proposed a lung image segmentation method by generative adversarial networks. We employed a variety of generative adversarial networks and use its capability of image translation to perform image segmentation. The generative adversarial networks was employed to translate the original lung image to the segmented image. The generative adversarial networks based segmentation method was test on real lung image data set. Experimental results shows that the proposed method is effective and outperform state-of-the art method.
