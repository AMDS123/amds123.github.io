##### Abstract
We demonstrate an InAlN/GaN-on-Si HEMT based UV detector with photo to dark current ratio > 107. Ti/Al/Ni/Au metal stack was evaporated and rapid thermal annealed for Ohmic contacts to the 2D electron gas (2DEG) at the InAlN/GaN interface while the channel + barrier was recess etched to a depth of 20 nm to pinch-off the 2DEG between Source-Drain pads. Spectral responsivity (SR) of 34 A/W at 367 nm was measured at 5 V in conjunction with very high photo to dark current ratio of > 10^7. The photo to dark current ratio at a fixed bias was found to be decreasing with increase in recess length of the PD. The fabricated devices were found to exhibit a UV-to-visible rejection ratio of >103 with a low dark current < 32 pA at 5 V. Transient measurements showed rise and fall times in the range of 3-4 ms. The gain mechanism was investigated and carrier lifetimes were estimated which matched well with those reported elsewhere.

我们展示了一个基于InAlN / GaN-on-Si HEMT的紫外探测器，其光电比为> 107。Ti / Al / Ni / Au金属叠层被蒸发并快速热退火以便与欧姆接触的二维电子气（2DEG） InAlN / GaN界面，而沟道+势垒被凹蚀至20nm的深度以夹断源极 - 漏极衬垫之间的2DEG。光谱响应度（SR）34 A / W在367纳米测量在5 V与非常高的光暗电流比率> 10 ^ 7。发现在一个固定的偏差下，照片与暗电流的比率随PD的凹陷长度的增加而减小。发现所制造的器件在5V下具有> 103的UV-可见光抑制比和低暗电流<32pA。瞬态测量显示在3-4ms范围内的上升和下降时间。对增益机制进行了调查，并估算了与其他地方报道的载流子寿命相匹配的载流子寿命。
