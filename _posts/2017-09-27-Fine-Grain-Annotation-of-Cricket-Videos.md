##### Abstract
The recognition of human activities is one of the key problems in video understanding. Action recognition is challenging even for specific categories of videos, such as sports, that contain only a small set of actions. Interestingly, sports videos are accompanied by detailed commentaries available online, which could be used to perform action annotation in a weakly-supervised setting. For the specific case of Cricket videos, we address the challenge of temporal segmentation and annotation of ctions with semantic descriptions. Our solution consists of two stages. In the first stage, the video is segmented into "scenes", by utilizing the scene category information extracted from text-commentary. The second stage consists of classifying video-shots as well as the phrases in the textual description into various categories. The relevant phrases are then suitably mapped to the video-shots. The novel aspect of this work is the fine temporal scale at which semantic information is assigned to the video. As a result of our approach, we enable retrieval of specific actions that last only a few seconds, from several hours of video. This solution yields a large number of labeled exemplars, with no manual effort, that could be used by machine learning algorithms to learn complex actions.

对人类活动的认识是视频理解中的关键问题之一。即使对于只包含一小部分操作的特定类别的视频（例如运动），动作识别也是具有挑战性的。有趣的是，体育视频伴随着详细的在线评论，可用于在弱监督的环境下进行行动注释。对于Cricket视频的具体情况，我们用语义描述来解决时态分割和注释的挑战。我们的解决方案包含两个阶段。在第一阶段，通过利用从文本解说中提取的场景类别信息将视频分割成“场景”。第二阶段包括将视频镜头以及文本描述中的短语分类为各种类别。然后将相关短语适当地映射到视频镜头。这项工作的新颖方面是语义信息被分配给视频的精细的时间尺度。通过我们的方法，我们可以从几个小时的视频中检索只持续几秒钟的特定操作。这种解决方案产生了大量标签化的示例，无需人工操作，机器学习算法可以用来学习复杂的动作。
