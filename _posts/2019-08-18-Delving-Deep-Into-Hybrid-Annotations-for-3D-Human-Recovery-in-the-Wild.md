##### Abstract
Though much progress has been achieved in single-image 3D human recovery, estimating 3D model for in-the-wild images remains a formidable challenge. The reason lies in the fact that obtaining high-quality 3D annotations for in-the-wild images is an extremely hard task that consumes enormous amount of resources and manpower. To tackle this problem, previous methods adopt a hybrid training strategy that exploits multiple heterogeneous types of annotations including 3D and 2D while leaving the efficacy of each annotation not thoroughly investigated. In this work, we aim to perform a comprehensive study on cost and effectiveness trade-off between different annotations. Specifically, we focus on the challenging task of in-the-wild 3D human recovery from single images when paired 3D annotations are not fully available. Through extensive experiments, we obtain several observations: 1) 3D annotations are efficient, whereas traditional 2D annotations such as 2D keypoints and body part segmentation are less competent in guiding 3D human recovery. 2) Dense Correspondence such as DensePose is effective. When there are no paired in-the-wild 3D annotations available, the model exploiting dense correspondence can achieve 92% of the performance compared to a model trained with paired 3D data. We show that incorporating dense correspondence into in-the-wild 3D human recovery is promising and competitive due to its high efficiency and relatively low annotating cost. Our model trained with dense correspondence can serve as a strong reference for future research.
