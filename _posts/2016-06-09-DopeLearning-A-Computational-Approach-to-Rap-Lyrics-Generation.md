##### Abstract
Writing rap lyrics requires both creativity to construct a meaningful, interesting story and lyrical skills to produce complex rhyme patterns, which form the cornerstone of good flow. We present a rap lyrics generation method that captures both of these aspects. First, we develop a prediction model to identify the next line of existing lyrics from a set of candidate next lines. This model is based on two machine-learning techniques: the RankSVM algorithm and a deep neural network model with a novel structure. Results show that the prediction model can identify the true next line among 299 randomly selected lines with an accuracy of 17%, i.e., over 50 times more likely than by random. Second, we employ the prediction model to combine lines from existing songs, producing lyrics with rhyme and a meaning. An evaluation of the produced lyrics shows that in terms of quantitative rhyme density, the method outperforms the best human rappers by 21%. The rap lyrics generator has been deployed as an online tool called DeepBeat, and the performance of the tool has been assessed by analyzing its usage logs. This analysis shows that machine-learned rankings correlate with user preferences.

写作说唱歌词既需要创造力，构建一个有意义的，有趣的故事和抒情的技能，以产生复杂的韵律模式，这是良好的流动的基石。我们提出一个说唱歌词生成方法，捕捉这两个方面。首先，我们制定一个预测模型，从一组候选下一行中找出现有歌词的下一行。该模型基于两种机器学习技术：RankSVM算法和具有新颖结构的深度神经网络模型。结果显示，预测模型能够在随机选择的299条线中确定真正的下一条线，其准确度为17％，即比随机的可能性高50倍以上。其次，我们使用预测模型来结合现有歌曲的线条，生成带有韵律和意义的歌词。对所产生的歌词的评价表明，就定量韵密度而言，该方法胜过最佳人类说唱歌手21％。说唱歌词生成器已被部署为一个名为DeepBeat的在线工具，并通过分析其使用日志来评估该工具的性能。这一分析表明，机器学习排名与用户偏好相关。
