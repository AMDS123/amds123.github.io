##### Abstract
The paper proposes a novel Kernelized image segmentation scheme for noisy images that utilizes the concept of Smallest Univalue Segment Assimilating Nucleus (SUSAN) and incorporates spatial constraints by computing circular colour map induced weights. Fuzzy damping coefficients are obtained for each nucleus or center pixel on the basis of the corresponding weighted SUSAN area values, the weights being equal to the inverse of the number of horizontal and vertical moves required to reach a neighborhood pixel from the center pixel. These weights are used to vary the contributions of the different nuclei in the Kernel based framework. The paper also presents an edge quality metric obtained by fuzzy decision based edge candidate selection and final computation of the blurriness of the edges after their selection. The inability of existing algorithms to preserve edge information and structural details in their segmented maps necessitates the computation of the edge quality factor (EQF) for all the competing algorithms. Qualitative and quantitative analysis have been rendered with respect to state-of-the-art algorithms and for images ridden with varying types of noises. Speckle noise ridden SAR images and Rician noise ridden Magnetic Resonance Images have also been considered for evaluating the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm in extracting important segmentation information.

本文提出了一种新颖的核图像分割方案，利用最小单视图同化核（SUSAN）的概念，并通过计算圆形彩色地图诱导权重合并空间约束。根据相应的加权SUSAN面积值，为每个原子核或中心像素获得模糊阻尼系数，该权重等于从中心像素到达邻近像素所需的水平和垂直移动次数的倒数。这些权重用于改变基于核的框架中不同核的贡献。提出了基于模糊决策的边缘候选选择方法得到的边缘质量度量，以及边缘选择后边缘模糊度的最终计算。现有算法无法保存其分段映射中的边缘信息和结构细节，因此需要计算所有竞争算法的边缘品质因子（EQF）。定性和定量分析是针对最先进的算法和用不同类型的噪音进行的图像进行的。散斑噪声SAR图像和Rician杂波噪声磁共振图像也被用来评估所提出的算法在提取重要分割信息中的有效性。
