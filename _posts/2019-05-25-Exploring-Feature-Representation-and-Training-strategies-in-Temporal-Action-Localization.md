##### Abstract
Temporal action localization has recently attracted significant interest in the Computer Vision community. However, despite the great progress, it is hard to identify which aspects of the proposed methods contribute most to the increase in localization performance. To address this issue, we conduct ablative experiments on feature extraction methods, fixed-size feature representation methods and training strategies, and report how each influences the overall performance. Based on our findings, we propose a two-stage detector that outperforms the state of the art in THUMOS14, achieving a mAP@tIoU=0.5 equal to 44.2%.
