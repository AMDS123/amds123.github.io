##### Abstract
It is increasingly common in many types of natural and physical systems (especially biological systems) to have different types of measurements performed on the same underlying system. In such settings, it is important to align the manifolds arising from each measurement in order to integrate such data and gain an improved picture of the system. We tackle this problem using generative adversarial networks (GANs). Recently, GANs have been utilized to try to find correspondences between sets of samples. However, these GANs are not explicitly designed for proper alignment of manifolds. We present a new GAN called the Manifold-Aligning GAN (MAGAN) that aligns two manifolds such that related points in each measurement space are aligned together. We demonstrate applications of MAGAN in single-cell biology in integrating two different measurement types together. In our demonstrated examples, cells from the same tissue are measured with both genomic (single-cell RNA-sequencing) and proteomic (mass cytometry) technologies. We show that the MAGAN successfully aligns them such that known correlations between measured markers are improved compared to other recently proposed models.

在许多类型的自然和物理系统（特别是生物系统）中，在相同的基础系统上执行不同类型的测量的情况越来越普遍。在这种情况下，重要的是对齐每个测量产生的流形，以便整合这些数据并获得系统的改进图像。我们使用生成对抗网络（GAN）来解决这个问题。最近，GAN被用来试图找出样本集之间的对应关系。但是，这些GAN并没有明确设计用于正确对齐流形。我们提出了一种新的GAN，称为流形对齐GAN（MAGAN），它将两个流形对齐，从而将每个测量空间中的相关点对齐在一起。我们演示MAGAN在单细胞生物学中将两种不同测量类型整合在一起的应用。在我们展示的例子中，来自同一组织的细胞用基因组（单细胞RNA测序）和蛋白质组学（大规模细胞术）技术进行测量。我们证明，MAGAN成功地将它们对齐，使得与其他最近提出的模型相比，测量标记之间的已知相关性得到改善。
