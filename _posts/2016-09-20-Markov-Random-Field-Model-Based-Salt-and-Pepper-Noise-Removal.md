##### Abstract
Problem of impulse noise reduction is a very well studied problem in image processing community and many different approaches have been proposed to tackle this problem. In the current work, the problem of fixed value impulse noise (salt and pepper) removal from images is investigated by use of a Markov Random Field (MRF) models with smoothness priors. After the formulation of the problem as an inpainting problem, graph cuts with $\alpha$-expansion moves are considered for minimization of the energy functional. As for comparisons, several other minimization techniques that are widely used for MRF models' optimization are considered and the results are compared using Peak-Signal-to-Noise-Ratio (PSNR) and Structural Similarity Index (SSIM) as metrics. The investigations show the superiority of graph cuts with $\alpha$-expansion moves over the other techniques both in terms of PSNR and also computational times.

脉冲噪声降低问题在图像处理领域是一个非常好的研究问题，为解决这个问题提出了许多不同的方法。在目前的工作中，从图像中去除定值脉冲噪声（盐和胡椒）的问题是通过使用具有平滑度先验的马尔可夫随机场（MRF）模型来研究的。在将问题描述为一个修补问题之后，考虑使用$ \ alpha $膨胀移动的图形切割来最小化能量泛函。至于比较，还考虑了广泛用于MRF模型优化的其他几种最小化技术，并且使用峰值信噪比（PSNR）和结构相似性指数（SSIM）作为度量来比较结果。调查显示，在PSNR和计算时间方面，具有$ \ alpha $扩展的图形切割优于其他技术。
