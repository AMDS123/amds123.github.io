##### Abstract
In this paper, we introduce a new modeling approach of texts for handwriting recognition based on syllables. We propose a supervised syllabification approach for the French and English languages for building a vocabulary of syllables. Statistical n-gram language models of syllables are trained on French and English Wikipedia corpora. The handwriting recognition system, based on optical HMM context independent character models, performs a two pass decoding, integrating the proposed syllabic models. Evaluation is carried out on the French RIMES dataset and English IAM dataset by analyzing the performance for various coverage of the syllable models. We also compare the syllable models with lexicon and character n-gram models. The proposed approach reaches interesting performances thanks to its capacity to cover a large amount of out of vocabulary words working with a limited amount of syllables combined with statistical n-gram of reasonable order.

在本文中，我们介绍了一种基于音节的手写识别文本的新建模方法。我们为法语和英语语言提出了一种有监督的音节教学方法，用于构建音节词汇。在法语和英语维基百科语料库上训练音节的统计n-gram语言模型。基于光学HMM上下文独立字符模型的手写识别系统执行两遍解码，集成所提出的音节模型。通过分析音节模型的各种覆盖的性能，对法国RIMES数据集和英语IAM数据集进行评估。我们还将音节模型与词典和字符n-gram模型进行比较。所提出的方法达到了有趣的性能，因为它能够覆盖大量的词汇单词，使用有限的音节和合理顺序的统计n-gram。
