##### Abstract
We propose a method, called Label Embedding Network, which can learn label representation (label embedding) during the training process of deep networks. With the proposed method, the label embedding is adaptively and automatically learned through back propagation. The original one-hot represented loss function is converted into a new loss function with soft distributions, such that the originally unrelated labels have continuous interactions with each other during the training process. As a result, the trained model can achieve substantially higher accuracy and with faster convergence speed. Experimental results based on competitive tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, and the learned label embedding is reasonable and interpretable. The proposed method achieves comparable or even better results than the state-of-the-art systems. The source code is available at \url{this https URL}.

##### Abstract (translated by Google)
我们提出一种称为标签嵌入网络的方法，可以在深度网络训练过程中学习标签表示（标签嵌入）。利用所提出的方法，通过反向传播自适应地自动学习标签嵌入。将原来的一个单独表示的损失函数转化为一个新的具有软分布的损失函数，使得原来不相关的标签在训练过程中具有连续的相互作用。因此，训练后的模型可以实现更高的精度和更快的收敛速度。基于竞争任务的实验结果证明了该方法的有效性，并且学习到的标签嵌入是合理可解释的。所提出的方法实现了与现有技术系统相比甚至更好的结果。源代码位于\ url {this https URL}。
