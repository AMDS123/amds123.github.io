##### Abstract
The Aduio-visual Speech Recognition (AVSR) which employs both the video and audio information to do Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) is one of the application of multimodal leaning making ASR system more robust and accuracy. The traditional models usually treated AVSR as inference or projection but strict prior limits its ability. As the revival of deep learning, Deep Neural Networks (DNN) becomes an important toolkit in many traditional classification tasks including ASR, image classification, natural language processing. Some DNN models were used in AVSR like Multimodal Deep Autoencoders (MDAEs), Multimodal Deep Belief Network (MDBN) and Multimodal Deep Boltzmann Machine (MDBM) that actually work better than traditional methods. However, such DNN models have several shortcomings: (1) They don't balance the modal fusion and temporal fusion, or even haven't temporal fusion; (2)The architecture of these models isn't end-to-end, the training and testing getting cumbersome. We propose a DNN model, Auxiliary Multimodal LSTM (am-LSTM), to overcome such weakness. The am-LSTM could be trained and tested once, moreover easy to train and preventing overfitting automatically. The extensibility and flexibility are also take into consideration. The experiments show that am-LSTM is much better than traditional methods and other DNN models in three datasets.

使用视频和音频信息进行自动语音识别（ASR）的Aduio-visual语音识别（AVSR）是多模式学习的一个应用，使ASR系统更加健壮和准确。传统的模型通常把AVSR当作推理或投影，但严格的事先限制了它的能力。随着深度学习的不断深入，深度神经网络（DNN）成为许多传统分类任务（包括ASR，图像分类，自然语言处理等）的重要工具。一些DNN模型在AVSR中使用，如多模式深度自动编码器（MDAEs），多模态深信网（MDBN）和多模深玻尔兹曼机（MDBM），其实际上比传统方法工作得更好。但是这种DNN模型存在一些缺点：（1）不能平衡模态融合和时间融合，甚至不能进行时间​​融合; （2）这些模型的架构不是端到端，训练和测试变得繁琐。我们提出DNN模型，辅助多模式LSTM（am-LSTM）来克服这种弱点。 am-LSTM可以进行一次训练和测试，而且易于训练和自动防止过拟合。可扩展性和灵活性也被考虑在内。实验表明，在三个数据集中，am-LSTM比传统方法和其他DNN模型好得多。
