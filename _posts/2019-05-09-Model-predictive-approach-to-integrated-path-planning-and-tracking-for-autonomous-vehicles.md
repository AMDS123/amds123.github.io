##### Abstract
In the path planning problem of autonomous application, the existing studies separately consider the path planning and trajectory tracking control of the autonomous vehicle and few of them have integrated the trajectory planning and trajectory control together. To fill in this research gap, this study proposes an integrated trajectory planning and trajectory control method. This paper also studies the collision avoidance problem of autonomous by considering static and dynamic obstacles. Simulation results have been presented to show the effectiveness of the proposed control method.
