##### Abstract
Because combat environments change over time and technology upgrades are widespread for ground vehicles, a large number of vehicles and equipment become quickly obsolete. A possible solution for the U.S. Army is to develop fleets of modular military vehicles, which are built by interchangeable substantial components also known as modules. One of the typical characteristics of module is their ease of assembly and disassembly through simple means such as plug-in/pull-out actions, which allows for real-time fleet reconfiguration to meet dynamic demands. Moreover, military demands are time-varying and highly stochastic because commanders keep reacting to enemy's actions. To capture these characteristics, we formulated an intelligent agent-based model to imitate decision making process during fleet operation, which combines real-time optimization with artificial intelligence. The agents are capable of inferring enemy's future move based on historical data and optimize dispatch/operation decisions accordingly. We implement our model to simulate an attacker-defender game between two adversarial and intelligent players, representing the commanders from modularized fleet and conventional fleet respectively. Given the same level of combat resources and intelligence, we highlight the tactical advantages of fleet modularity in terms of win rate, unpredictability and suffered damage.
