##### Abstract
In this paper, we propose a new systematic approach based on nonquadratic Lyapunov function and technique of introducing slack matrices, for a class of affine nonlinear systems with disturbance. To achieve the goal, first, the affine nonlinear system is represented via Takagi-Sugeno (T-S) fuzzy bilinear model. Subsequently, the robust H_inf controller is designed based on parallel distributed compensation (PDC) scheme. Then, the stability conditions are derived in terms of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs) by utilizing Lyapunov function. Moreover, some slack matrices are proposed to reduce the conservativeness of the LMI stability conditions. Finally, for illustrating the merits and verifying the effectiveness of the proposed approach, the application of an isothermal continuous stirred tank reactor (CSTR) for Van de Vusse reactor is discussed in details.
