##### Abstract
Networks are ubiquitous structure that describes complex relationships between different entities in the real world. As a critical component of prediction task over nodes in networks, learning the feature representation of nodes has become one of the most active areas recently. Network Embedding, aiming to learn non-linear and low-dimensional feature representation based on network topology, has been proved to be helpful on tasks of network analysis, especially node classification. For many real-world systems, multiple types of relations are naturally represented by multiple networks. However, existing network embedding methods mainly focus on single network embedding and neglect the information shared among different networks. In this paper, we propose a novel multiple network embedding method based on semisupervised autoencoder, named DeepMNE, which captures complex topological structures of multi-networks and takes the correlation among multi-networks into account. We evaluate DeepMNE on the task of node classification with two real-world datasets. The experimental results demonstrate the superior performance of our method over four state-of-the-art algorithms.

网络是无处不在的结构，描述了现实世界中不同实体之间的复杂关系。作为网络中节点预测任务的关键组成部分，学习节点的特征表示已成为最近最活跃的领域之一。网络嵌入，旨在学习基于网络拓扑的非线性和低维特征表示，已被证明有助于网络分析，特别是节点分类的任务。对于许多现实世界的系统，多种类型的关系自然地由多个网络表示。然而，现有的网络嵌入方法主要集中在单网络嵌入上，忽略了不同网络之间共享的信息。在本文中，我们提出了一种基于半监测自动编码器的新型多网络嵌入方法，名为DeepMNE，它捕获多网络的复杂拓扑结构，并考虑多网络之间的相关性。我们使用两个真实数据集评估DeepMNE的节点分类任务。实验结果证明了我们的方法优于四种最先进的算法。
