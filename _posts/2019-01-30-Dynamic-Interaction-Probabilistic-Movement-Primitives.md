##### Abstract
Human-robot collaboration is on the rise. Robots need to increasingly improve the efficiency and smoothness with which they assist humans by properly anticipating a human's intention. To do so, prediction models need to increase their accuracy and responsiveness. This work builds on top of Interaction Movement Primitives with phase estimation and re-formulates the framework to use dynamic human-motion observations which constantly update anticipatory motions. The original framework only considers a single fixed-duration static human observation which is used to perform only one anticipatory motion. Dynamic observations, with built-in phase estimation, yield a series of updated robot motion distributions. Co-activation is performed between the existing and newest most probably robot motion distribution. This results in smooth anticipatory robot motions that are highly accurate and with enhanced responsiveness.
