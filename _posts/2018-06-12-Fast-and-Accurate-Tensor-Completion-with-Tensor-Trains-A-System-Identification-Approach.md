##### Abstract
This paper proposes a new tensor completion method based on tensor trains and system identification. The to be completed tensor is modeled as a low-rank tensor train system and the coordinates and corresponding tensor entries are interpreted as system inputs and outputs, respectively. A novel tensor train initialization procedure is proposed specifically for image and video completion, which ensures faster convergence of the completion algorithm. The tensor train framework is also shown to easily accommodate Total Variation and Tikhonov regularization due to their low-rank tensor train representations. Image and video inpainting experiments verify the superiority of the proposed scheme in terms of both speed, accuracy, and scalability, where a speedup of up to 60X is observed compared to state-of-the-art tensor completion methods at a similar accuracy.

本文提出了一种基于张量序列和系统辨识的张量完备方法。待完成的张量被建模为低秩张量系统，坐标和相应的张量条目分别被解释为系统输入和输出。提出了一种新的张量训练初始化程序，专门用于图像和视频的完成，保证了完成算法的收敛速度更快。由于它们的低秩张量训练表示，张量训练框架也显示出容易适应总变分和Tikhonov正则化。图像和视频修补实验验证了所提出的方案在速度，准确性和可扩展性方面的优越性，其中以相似的准确度与最先进的张量完成方法相比，观察到高达60X的加速。
