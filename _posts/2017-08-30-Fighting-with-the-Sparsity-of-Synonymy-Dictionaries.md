##### Abstract
Graph-based synset induction methods, such as MaxMax and Watset, induce synsets by performing a global clustering of a synonymy graph. However, such methods are sensitive to the structure of the input synonymy graph: sparseness of the input dictionary can substantially reduce the quality of the extracted synsets. In this paper, we propose two different approaches designed to alleviate the incompleteness of the input dictionaries. The first one performs a pre-processing of the graph by adding missing edges, while the second one performs a post-processing by merging similar synset clusters. We evaluate these approaches on two datasets for the Russian language and discuss their impact on the performance of synset induction methods. Finally, we perform an extensive error analysis of each approach and discuss prominent alternative methods for coping with the problem of the sparsity of the synonymy dictionaries.

##### Abstract (translated by Google)
基于图形的synset感应方法（如MaxMax和Watset）通过对同义词图进行全局聚类来诱发同义词集。然而，这种方法对输入同义词图的结构很敏感：输入字典的稀疏性可能会大大降低提取的同义词的质量。在本文中，我们提出了两种不同的方法来缓解输入字典的不完整性。第一个通过添加缺失的边来执行图的预处理，而第二个通过合并类似的同义集来执行后处理。我们在俄罗斯语言的两个数据集上评估这些方法，并讨论它们对synset感应方法性能的影响。最后，我们对每种方法进行了大量的错误分析，并讨论了应对同义词词典稀疏性问题的突出的替代方法。
