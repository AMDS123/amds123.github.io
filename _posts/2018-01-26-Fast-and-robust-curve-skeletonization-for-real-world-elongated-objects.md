##### Abstract
We consider the problem of extracting curve skeletons of three-dimensional, elongated objects given a noisy surface, which has applications in agricultural contexts such as extracting the branching structure of plants. We describe an efficient and robust method based on breadth-first search that can determine curve skeletons in these contexts. Our approach is capable of automatically detecting junction points as well as spurious segments and loops. All of that is accomplished with only one user-adjustable parameter. The run time of our method ranges from hundreds of milliseconds to less than four seconds on large, challenging datasets, which makes it appropriate for situations where real-time decision making is needed. Experiments on synthetic models as well as on data from real world objects, some of which were collected in challenging field conditions, show that our approach compares favorably to classical thinning algorithms as well as to recent contributions to the field.

##### Abstract (translated by Google)
我们考虑提取具有噪声表面的三维细长物体曲线骨架的问题，在农业环境中提取植物的分支结构等方面有其应用。我们描述了一种基于广度优先搜索的高效稳健的方法，可以确定这些上下文中的曲线骨架。我们的方法能够自动检测交点以及伪分段和循环。所有这一切只用一个用户可调参数来完成。我们的方法的运行时间范围从几百毫秒到不到四秒，这对于需要实时决策的情况非常适合。在合成模型上进行的实验以及来自真实世界对象的数据，其中一些在具有挑战性的现场条件下收集，显示我们的方法与经典细化算法以及最近对该领域的贡献相比有利。
