##### Abstract
In the following paper we will discuss data structures suited for distance threshold queries keeping in mind real life application such as collision detection on robotic bees. We will focus on spatial hashes designed to store 3D points and capable of fastly determining which of them surpass a specific threshold from any other. In this paper we will discuss related literature, explain in depth the data structure chosen with its design criteria, operations and speed and memory efficiency analysis.
