##### Abstract
PRAM puts agent-based models on a sound probabilistic footing as a basis for integrating agent-based and probabilistic models. It extends the themes of probabilistic relational models and lifted inference to incorporate dynamical models and simulation. It can also be much more efficient than agent-based simulation.
