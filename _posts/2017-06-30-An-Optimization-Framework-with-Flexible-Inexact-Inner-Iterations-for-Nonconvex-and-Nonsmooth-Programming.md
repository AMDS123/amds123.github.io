##### Abstract
In recent years, numerous vision and learning tasks have been (re)formulated as nonconvex and nonsmooth programmings(NNPs). Although some algorithms have been proposed for particular problems, designing fast and flexible optimization schemes with theoretical guarantee is a challenging task for general NNPs. It has been investigated that performing inexact inner iterations often benefit to special applications case by case, but their convergence behaviors are still unclear. Motivated by these practical experiences, this paper designs a novel algorithmic framework, named inexact proximal alternating direction method (IPAD) for solving general NNPs. We demonstrate that any numerical algorithms can be incorporated into IPAD for solving subproblems and the convergence of the resulting hybrid schemes can be consistently guaranteed by a series of simple error conditions. Beyond the guarantee in theory, numerical experiments on both synthesized and real-world data further demonstrate the superiority and flexibility of our IPAD framework for practical use.

近年来，许多视觉和学习任务已经（重新）制定为非凸和非平滑编程（NNP）。虽然针对特定问题提出了一些算法，但是设计具有理论保证的快速灵活的优化方案对于一般的NNP来说是一个具有挑战性的任务已经进行了调查，执行不精确的内部迭代通常受益于特殊的应用情况，但它们的收敛行为仍然不清楚。受这些实践经验的启发，本文设计了一种新的算法框架，称为不确定近交替方向法（IPAD），用于求解一般的NNP。我们证明，任何数值算法都可以并入到IPAD中来解决子问题，并且由此产生的混合方案的收敛可以通过一系列简单的错误条件得到一致的保证。除理论保证外，综合和实际数据的数值实验进一步证明了我们的IPAD框架在实际应用中的优越性和灵活性。
