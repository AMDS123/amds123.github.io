##### Abstract
Distributed Acoustic Sensing (DAS) using fiber optic cables is a promising new technology for pipeline monitoring and protection. In this work, we applied and compared two approaches for event detection using DAS: Classic machine learning approach and the approach based on image processing and deep learning. Although with both approaches acceptable performance can be achieved, the preliminary results show that image based deep learning is more promising approach, offering six times lower event detection delay and twelve times lower execution time.
