##### Abstract
A problem is addressed of minimization of the number of measurements needed for digital image acquisition and reconstruction with a given accuracy. A sampling theory based method of image sampling and reconstruction is suggested that allows to draw near the minimal rate of image sampling defined by the sampling theory. Presented and discussed are also results of experimental verification of the method and its possible applicability extensions.

##### Abstract (translated by Google)
以给定的精度解决了数字图像采集和重建所需的测量次数最小化的问题。提出了一种基于采样理论的图像采样和重构方法，可以在采样理论所定义的最小图像采样率附近进行绘制。提出并讨论的也是该方法的实验验证结果及其可能的适用性扩展。
