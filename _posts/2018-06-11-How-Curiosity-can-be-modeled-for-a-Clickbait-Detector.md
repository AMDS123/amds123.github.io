##### Abstract
The impact of continually evolving digital technologies and the proliferation of communications and content has now been widely acknowledged to be central to understanding our world. What is less acknowledged is that this is based on the successful arousing of curiosity both at the collective and individual levels. Advertisers, communication professionals and news editors are in constant competition to capture attention of the digital population perennially shifty and distracted. This paper, tries to understand how curiosity works in the digital world by attempting the first ever work done on quantifying human curiosity, basing itself on various theories drawn from humanities and social sciences. Curious communication pushes people to spot, read and click the message from their social feed or any other form of online presentation. Our approach focuses on measuring the strength of the stimulus to generate reader curiosity by using unsupervised and supervised machine learning algorithms, but is also informed by philosophical, psychological, neural and cognitive studies on this topic. Manually annotated news headlines - clickbaits - have been selected for the study, which are known to have drawn huge reader response. A binary classifier was developed based on human curiosity (unlike the work done so far using words and other linguistic features). Our classifier shows an accuracy of 97% . This work is part of the research in computational humanities on digital politics quantifying the emotions of curiosity and outrage on digital media.

不断发展的数字技术的影响以及通信和内容的扩散现在被广泛认为是理解我们的世界的核心。更不要说的是，这是基于在集体和个人层面上成功唤起好奇心。广告商，传播专业人士和新闻编辑一直在不断争夺数字人口的注意力，这些数字人口常常变得生疏和分心。本文试图通过尝试第一次量化人类好奇心的工作，并以人文和社会科学的各种理论为基础，来理解好奇心在数字世界中的作用。好奇的沟通促使人们发现，阅读并点击来自他们的社交Feed或任何其他形式的在线演示文稿的消息。我们的方法侧重于通过使用无监督和监督机器学习算法来测量刺激的强度以产生读者好奇心，但也通过关于该主题的哲学，心理学，神经和认知研究得到通知。已经为研究选择了手动注释的新闻标题 -  clickbaits  - 已经引起了巨大的读者反应。二元分类器是基于人类的好奇心而开发的（与迄今为止使用单词和其他语言特征完成的工作不同）。我们的分类器显示了97％的准确性。这项工作是数字媒体计算人文学研究的一部分，它对数字媒体的好奇心和愤怒情绪进行量化。
