##### Abstract
In this study, we have proposed a new type of tactile sensor that is capable of detecting the stiffness of soft objects. The sensor consists of a brass cylinder with an axial bore. An iron core can easily move inside the bore. Three peripheral bobbins were machined in the cylinder around which three coils have been wound. One of the coils was excited with an alternating current which caused a voltage to be induced in two other coils. A return spring was used to return the core to its initial position after it has been moved. The sensor was pressed against the surface of the object whose stiffness was going to be measured. The position of the core in this state was depended on the stiffness of the given object and the spring constant and was measured by measuring the change in the induced voltage in secondary coils. The proposed sensor was capable of measuring two contact parameters namely the applied force and the stiffness of the object. Using the data of this sensor, three different objects, made of polyurethane, silicon rubber and paraffin gel were discriminated. Thus, this sensor could be used in robot hands and minimally invasive surgery tools to improve their operation.

在这项研究中，我们提出了一种新型的触觉传感器，能够检测软物体的刚度。传感器由带有轴向孔的黄铜圆柱体组成。铁芯可以很容易地在孔内移动。在圆筒中加工三个外围线轴，围绕该圆筒缠绕三个线圈。其中一个线圈被交流电激励，这导致在另外两个线圈中感应出电压。在移动后，使用复位弹簧将芯子返回到其初始位置。将传感器压在物体表面上，该物体的刚度将被测量。在这种状态下，芯的位置取决于给定物体的刚度和弹簧常数，并通过测量次级线圈中感应电压的变化来测量。所提出的传感器能​​够测量两个接触参数，即施加的力和物体的刚度。使用该传感器的数据，区分了由聚氨酯，硅橡胶和石蜡凝胶制成的三种不同物体。因此，该传感器可用于机器人手和微创手术工具以改善其操作。
