##### Abstract
This paper presents an initial work on assessment of gait normality in which the human body motion is represented by a sequence of enhanced depth maps. The input data is provided by a system consisting of a Time-of-Flight (ToF) depth camera and two mirrors. This approach proposes two feature types to describe characteristics of localized points of interest and the level of posture symmetry. These two features are processed on a sequence of enhanced depth maps with the support of a sliding window to provide two corresponding scores. The gait assessment is finally performed based on a weighted combination of these two scores. The evaluation is performed by experimenting on 6 simulated abnormal gaits.
