##### Abstract
Gravitational mass flows, such as avalanches, debris flows and rockfalls are common events in alpine regions with high impact on transport routes. Within the last few decades, hazard zone maps have been developed to systematically approach this threat. These maps mark vulnerable zones in habitable areas to allow effective planning of hazard mitigation measures and development of settlements. Hazard zone maps have shown to be an effective tool to reduce fatalities during extreme events. They are created in a complex process, based on experience, empirical models, physical simulations and historical data. The generation of such maps is therefore expensive and limited to crucially important regions, e.g. permanently inhabited areas. 
 In this work we interpret the task of hazard zone mapping as a classification problem. Every point in a specific area has to be classified according to its vulnerability. On a regional scale this leads to a segmentation problem, where the total area has to be divided in the respective hazard zones. The recent developments in artificial intelligence, namely convolutional neuronal networks, have led to major improvement in a very similar task, image classification and semantic segmentation, i.e. computer vision. We use a convolutional neuronal network to identify terrain formations with the potential for catastrophic snow avalanches and label points in their reach as vulnerable. Repeating this procedure for all points allows us to generate an artificial hazard zone map. We demonstrate that the approach is feasible and promising based on the hazard zone map of the Tirolean Oberland. However, more training data and further improvement of the method is required before such techniques can be applied reliably.

引力质量流量，如雪崩，泥石流和落石是高山地区的常见事件，对运输路线影响很大。在过去的几十年中，已经开发出危险地带图来系统地处理这种威胁。这些地图标示可居住区域的脆弱地带，以便有效规划减灾措施和开发定居点。已经证明危险区域地图是减少极端事件期间死亡人数的有效工具。它们是根据经验，经验模型，物理模拟和历史数据在复杂的过程中创建的。因此这种地图的生成是昂贵的并且仅限于重要的重要区域，例如，永久居住的地区。
 在这项工作中，我们将危险区域映射的任务解释为分类问题。特定区域中的每个点都必须根据其脆弱性进行分类。在区域范围内，这导致了分割问题，其中总面积必须划分在相应的危险区域中。最近人工智能的发展，即卷积神经元网络，导致了非常相似的任务，图像分类和语义分割，即计算机视觉方面的重大改进。我们使用卷积神经元网络来识别地形地层，并有可能发生灾难性的雪崩和标签点的脆弱。对所有点重复此过程可以生成人造危险区域图。我们证明该方法是可行的并且基于Tirolean Oberland危险区域地图。然而，在可以可靠地应用这些技术之前，需要更多的训练数据和方法的进一步改进。
