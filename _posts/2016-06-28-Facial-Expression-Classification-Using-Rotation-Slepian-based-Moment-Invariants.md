##### Abstract
Rotation moment invariants have been of great interest in image processing and pattern recognition. This paper presents a novel kind of rotation moment invariants based on the Slepian functions, which were originally introduced in the method of separation of variables for Helmholtz equations. They were first proposed for time series by Slepian and his coworkers in the 1960s. Recent studies have shown that these functions have an good performance in local approximation compared to other approximation basis. Motivated by the good approximation performance, we construct the Slepian-based moments and derive the rotation invariant. We not only theoretically prove the invariance, but also discuss the experiments on real data. The proposed rotation invariants are robust to noise and yield decent performance in facial expression classification.

旋转不变矩对图像处理和模式识别具有重要意义。本文提出了一种基于Slepian函数的新型旋转不变矩，它最初是在亥姆霍兹方程的变量分离方法中引入的。他们最初是在1960年代由Slepian和他的同事提出的时间序列。最近的研究表明，与其他近似的基础相比，这些函数在局部逼近方面具有良好的性能。在良好的逼近性能的驱动下，我们构造了基于Slepian矩的导数并导出了旋转不变量。我们不仅在理论上证明了不变性，而且还讨论了实际数据的实验。所提出的旋转不变量对噪声是鲁棒的并且在面部表情分类中产生良好的性能。
