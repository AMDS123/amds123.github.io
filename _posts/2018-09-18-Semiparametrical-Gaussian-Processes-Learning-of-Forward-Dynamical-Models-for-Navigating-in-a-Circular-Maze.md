##### Abstract
This paper presents a problem of model learning for the purpose of learning how to navigate a ball to a goal state in a circular maze environment with two degrees of freedom. The motion of the ball in the maze environment is influenced by several non-linear effects such as dry friction and contacts, which are difficult to model physically. We propose a semiparametric model to estimate the motion dynamics of the ball based on Gaussian Process Regression equipped with basis functions obtained from physics first principles. The accuracy of this semiparametric model is shown not only in estimation but also in prediction at n-steps ahead and its compared with standard algorithms for model learning. The learned model is then used in a trajectory optimization algorithm to compute ball trajectories. We propose the system presented in the paper as a benchmark problem for reinforcement and robot learning, for its interesting and challenging dynamics and its relative ease of reproducibility.

本文提出了一个模型学习的问题，目的是学习如何在具有两个自由度的圆形迷宫环境中将球导航到目标状态。球在迷宫环境中的运动受到若干非线性效应的影响，例如干摩擦和接触，这些非线性效应难以物理模拟。我们提出了一种半参数模型来估计基于高斯过程回归的球的运动动力学，该高斯过程回归配备了从物理第一原理获得的基函数。该半参数模型的准确性不仅表现在估计上，而且表现在前面n步的预测中，并与模型学习的标准算法进行比较。然后将学习的模型用于轨迹优化算法中以计算球轨迹。我们提出本文提出的系统作为强化和机器人学习的基准问题，因为它有趣且具有挑战性的动力学及其相对容易的再现性。
