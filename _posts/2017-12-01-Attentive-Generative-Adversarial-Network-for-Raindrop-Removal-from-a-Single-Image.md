##### Abstract
Raindrops adhered to a glass window or camera lens can severely hamper the visibility of a background scene, and degrade an image considerably. In this paper, we address the problem by visually removing raindrops, and thus transforming a raindrop degraded image into a clean image. The problem is intractable, since first which regions are occluded by raindrops are not given. Second, the information about the background scene of the occluded regions for most part is completely lost. To resolve the problem, we apply an attentive generative network using the idea of adversarial training. Our main idea is to inject visual attention into both the generative and discriminative networks. In the training stage, our visual attention is guided by the locations of raindrop regions. Hence, by injecting this, the generative network will pay more attention to the raindrop regions and their surroundings which are the regions we want to modify; and, the discriminative network will be able to assess the local consistency of the restored regions. To our knowledge, this injection of visual attention to both generative and discriminative networks is novel. Our experiments show the effectiveness of our approach, which outperforms the state of the art methods quantitatively and qualitatively.

附着在玻璃窗或相机镜头上的雨滴会严重妨碍背景场景的可见性，并大大降低图像质量。在本文中，我们通过视觉上去除雨滴来解决这个问题，从而将雨滴降级的图像转化为干净的图像。这个问题是难以解决的，因为首先哪个区域被雨滴遮挡了。其次，大部分遮挡区域的背景信息完全丢失。为了解决这个问题，我们使用对抗训练的思想来应用一个周密的生成网络。我们的主要想法是将视觉注意力注入生成网络和判别网络。在训练阶段，我们的视觉注意力是由雨滴地区的位置指导。因此，通过注入这个网络，生成网络将更加关注我们想要修改的雨滴区域和周围环境;区分网络将能够评估恢复区域的局部一致性。据我们所知，这种对生成型和辨别型网络的视觉注意力是新颖的。我们的实验显示了我们的方法的有效性，它在数量上和质量上优于现有技术的方法。
