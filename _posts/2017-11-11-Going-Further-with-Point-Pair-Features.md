##### Abstract
Point Pair Features is a widely used method to detect 3D objects in point clouds, however they are prone to fail in presence of sensor noise and background clutter. We introduce novel sampling and voting schemes that significantly reduces the influence of clutter and sensor noise. Our experiments show that with our improvements, PPFs become competitive against state-of-the-art methods as it outperforms them on several objects from challenging benchmarks, at a low computational cost.

点对特征是检测点云中的三维物体的一种广泛使用的方法，但是在存在传感器噪声和背景混乱的情况下它们很容易失败。我们引入了新颖的采样和投票方案，大大减少了杂波和传感器噪声的影响。我们的实验表明，随着我们的改进，PPF变得与最先进的方法相比具有竞争力，因为它以低计算成本从具有挑战性的基准测试中胜出。
