##### Abstract
Matching corresponding features between two images is a fundamental task to computer vision with numerous applications in object recognition, robotics, and 3D reconstruction. Current state of the art in image feature matching has focused on establishing a single consistency in static scenes; by contrast, finding multiple consistencies in dynamic scenes has been under-researched. In this paper, we present an end-to-end optimization framework named "iterative clustering with Game-Theoretic Matching" (ic-GTM) for robust multi-consistency correspondence. The key idea is to formulate multi-consistency matching as a generalized clustering problem for an image pair. In our formulation, several local matching games are simultaneously carried out in different corresponding block pairs under the guidance of a novel payoff function consisting of both geometric and descriptive compatibility; the global matching results are further iteratively refined by clustering and thresholding with respect to a payoff matrix. We also propose three new metrics for evaluating the performance of multi-consistency image feature matching. Extensive experimental results have shown that the proposed framework significantly outperforms previous state-of-the-art approaches on both singleconsistency and multi-consistency datasets.
