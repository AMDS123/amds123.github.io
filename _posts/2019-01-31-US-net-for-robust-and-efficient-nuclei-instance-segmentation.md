##### Abstract
We present a novel neural network architecture, US-Net, for robust nuclei instance segmentation in histopathology images. The proposed framework integrates the nuclei detection and segmentation networks by sharing their outputs through the same foundation network, and thus enhancing the performance of both. The detection network takes into account the high-level semantic cues with contextual information, while the segmentation network focuses more on the low-level details like the edges. Extensive experiments reveal that our proposed framework can strengthen the performance of both branch networks in an integrated architecture and outperforms most of the state-of-the-art nuclei detection and segmentation networks.
