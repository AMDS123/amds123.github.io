##### Abstract
We present OpenSeq2Seq - a TensorFlow-based toolkit for training sequence-to-sequence models that features distributed and mixed-precision training. Benchmarks on machine translation and speech recognition tasks show that models built using OpenSeq2Seq give state-of-the-art performance at 1.5-3x less training time. OpenSeq2Seq currently provides building blocks for models that solve a wide range of tasks including neural machine translation, automatic speech recognition, and speech synthesis.
