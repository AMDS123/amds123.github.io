##### Abstract
For more than two decades, research has been performed on content-based image retrieval (CBIR). By combining Radon projections and the support vector machines (SVM), a content-based medical image retrieval method is presented in this work. The proposed approach employs the normalized Radon projections with corresponding image category labels to build an SVM classifier, and the Radon barcode database which encodes every image in a binary format is also generated simultaneously to tag all images. To retrieve similar images when a query image is given, Radon projections and the barcode of the query image are generated. Subsequently, the k-nearest neighbor search method is applied to find the images with minimum Hamming distance of the Radon barcode within the same class predicted by the trained SVM classifier that uses Radon features. The performance of the proposed method is validated by using the IRMA 2009 dataset with 14,410 x-ray images in 57 categories. The results demonstrate that our method has the capacity to retrieve similar responses for the correctly identified query image and even for those mistakenly classified by SVM. The approach further is very fast and has low memory requirement.

二十多年来，对基于内容的图像检索（CBIR）进行了研究。通过结合Radon投影和支持向量机（SVM），提出了一种基于内容的医学图像检索方法。该方法采用归一化的Radon投影和相应的图像分类标签构建SVM分类器，并同时生成以二进制格式对每个图像进行编码的Radon条码数据库，对所有图像进行标注。当查询图像被给出时，为了检索相似的图像，生成氡投影和查询图像的条形码。随后，应用k-最近邻搜索方法来查找使用Radon特征的经训练的SVM分类器所预测的具有相同类别中的Radon条形码的最小海明距离的图像。所提出的方法的性能通过使用具有14,410个X射线图像的57个类别的IRMA 2009数据集来验证。结果表明，我们的方法有能力为正确识别的查询图像检索类似的响应，甚至对于那些被SVM错误分类的查询。该方法进一步非常快，并且具有低内存要求。
