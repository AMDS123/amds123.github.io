##### Abstract
Traditional supervised learning makes the closed-world assumption that the classes appeared in the test data must have appeared in training. This also applies to text learning or text classification. As learning is used increasingly in dynamic open environments where some new/test documents may not belong to any of the training classes, identifying these novel documents during classification presents an important problem. This problem is called open-world classification or open classification. This paper proposes a novel deep learning based approach. It outperforms existing state-of-the-art techniques dramatically.

##### Abstract (translated by Google)
传统的监督式学习使得在测试数据中出现的类必须出现在训练中的封闭世界的假设。这也适用于文本学习或文本分类。由于学习越来越多地应用于动态开放的环境中，其中一些新的/测试文档可能不属于任何训练类别，所以在分类期间识别这些新颖的文档是一个重要的问题。这个问题被称为开放世界的分类或开放分类。本文提出了一种新的基于深度学习的方法。它远远胜过现有的最先进的技术。
