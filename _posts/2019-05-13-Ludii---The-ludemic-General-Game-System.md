##### Abstract
While current General Game Playing (GGP) systems facilitate useful research in Artificial Intelligence (AI) for game-playing, they are often somewhat specialized and computationally inefficient. In this paper, we describe an initial version of a "ludemic" general game system called Ludii, which has the potential to provide an efficient tool for AI researchers as well game designers, historians, educators and practitioners in related fields. Ludii defines games as structures of ludemes, i.e. high-level, easily understandable game concepts. We establish the foundations of Ludii by outlining its main benefits: generality, extensibility, understandability and efficiency. Experimentally, Ludii outperforms one of the most efficient Game Description Language (GDL) reasoners, based on a propositional network, for all available games in the Tiltyard GGP repository.
