##### Abstract
It is well known that metamodel or surrogate modeling techniques have been widely applied in engineering problems due to their higher efficiency. However, with the increase of the linearity and dimensions, it is difficult for the present popular metamodeling techniques to construct reliable metamodel and apply to more and more complicated high dimensional problems. Recently, neural networks (NNs), especially deep neural networks (DNNs) have been widely recognized as feasible and effective tools for multidiscipline. Actually, some popular NNs, such as back propagation neural networks (BPNNs) can be regarded as a kind of metamodeling techniques. However, for high dimensional problems, it seems difficult for a BPNN to construct a metamodel. In this study, to construct the high accurate metamodel efficiently, another powerful NN, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are introduced to construct metamodels. Considering the distinctive characteristic of the CNNs, the CNNs are considered to be a potential modeling tool to handle highly nonlinear and dimensional problems with the limited training samples.

众所周知，元模型或代理建模技术由于其较高的效率而被广泛应用于工程问题。但是，随着线性和尺寸的增加，目前流行的元建模技术难以构建可靠的元模型，并且适用于越来越复杂的高维问题。近年来，神经网络（NNs），特别是深度神经网络（DNNs）已被广泛认为是多学科可行和有效的工具。实际上，一些流行的神经网络，如BP神经网络（BPNN）可以看作是一种元建模技术。然而，对于高维问题，BPNN似乎很难构建元模型。在这项研究中，为了有效地构建高精度的元模型，引入了另一个强大的NN卷积神经网络（CNNs）来构建元模型。考虑到CNN的显着特点，CNN被认为是一个潜在的建模工具来处理有限的训练样本的高度非线性和尺寸问题。
