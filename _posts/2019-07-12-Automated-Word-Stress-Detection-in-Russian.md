##### Abstract
In this study we address the problem of automated word stress detection in Russian using character level models and no part-speech-taggers. We use a simple bidirectional RNN with LSTM nodes and achieve the accuracy of 90% or higher. We experiment with two training datasets and show that using the data from an annotated corpus is much more efficient than using a dictionary, since it allows us to take into account word frequencies and the morphological context of the word.
