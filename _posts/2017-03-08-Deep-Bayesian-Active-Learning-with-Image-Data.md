##### Abstract
Even though active learning forms an important pillar of machine learning, deep learning tools are not prevalent within it. Deep learning poses several difficulties when used in an active learning setting. First, active learning (AL) methods generally rely on being able to learn and update models from small amounts of data. Recent advances in deep learning, on the other hand, are notorious for their dependence on large amounts of data. Second, many AL acquisition functions rely on model uncertainty, yet deep learning methods rarely represent such model uncertainty. In this paper we combine recent advances in Bayesian deep learning into the active learning framework in a practical way. We develop an active learning framework for high dimensional data, a task which has been extremely challenging so far, with very sparse existing literature. Taking advantage of specialised models such as Bayesian convolutional neural networks, we demonstrate our active learning techniques with image data, obtaining a significant improvement on existing active learning approaches. We demonstrate this on both the MNIST dataset, as well as for skin cancer diagnosis from lesion images (ISIC2016 task).

尽管主动学习是机器学习的重要支柱，但深度学习工具并不普遍。深度学习在积极的学习环境中使用会带来一些困难。首先，主动学习（AL）方法通常依赖于能够从少量数据中学习和更新模型。另一方面，深度学习方面的最新进展以其依赖大量数据而臭名昭着。其次，许多AL获取函数依赖于模型的不确定性，然而深度学习方法很少代表这种模型的不确定性在本文中，我们将贝叶斯深度学习的最新进展结合到主动学习框架中。我们为高维数据开发了一个主动的学习框架，迄今为止这个任务非常具有挑战性，现有文献非常稀少。利用贝叶斯卷积神经网络等专门模型，我们证明了我们的主动学习技术与图像数据，获得现有的主动学习方法的重大改进。我们在MNIST数据集以及从病变图像诊断皮肤癌（ISIC2016任务）上证明了这一点。
