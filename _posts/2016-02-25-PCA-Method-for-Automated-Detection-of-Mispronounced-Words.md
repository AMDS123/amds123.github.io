##### Abstract
This paper presents a method for detecting mispronunciations with the aim of improving Computer Assisted Language Learning (CALL) tools used by foreign language learners. The algorithm is based on Principle Component Analysis (PCA). It is hierarchical with each successive step refining the estimate to classify the test word as being either mispronounced or correct. Preprocessing before detection, like normalization and time-scale modification, is implemented to guarantee uniformity of the feature vectors input to the detection system. The performance using various features including spectrograms and Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs) are compared and evaluated. Best results were obtained using MFCCs, achieving up to 99% accuracy in word verification and 93% in native/non-native classification. Compared with Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) which are used pervasively in recognition application, this particular approach is computational efficient and effective when training data is limited.

为了提高外语学习者使用计算机辅助语言学习（CALL）工具的目的，本文提出了一种检测错误发音的方法。该算法基于主成分分析（PCA）。它是分层次的，每一个连续的步骤细化估计，将测试词分类为错误的或正确的。为了保证输入到检测系统的特征矢量的一致性，实现了检测前的预处理，如标准化和时标修正。比较和评估使用各种特征（包括谱图和梅尔频率倒谱系数（MFCC））的性能。使用MFCC获得最好的结果，字验证的准确率高达99％，本地/非本地分类的准确率高达93％。与广泛应用于识别应用的隐马尔可夫模型（HMM）相比，这种方法在训练数据有限的情况下计算效率高，效果好。
