##### Abstract
Visual Object tracking research has undergone significant improvement in the past few years. The emergence of tracking by detection approach in tracking paradigm has been quite successful in many ways. Recently, deep convolutional neural networks have been extensively used in most successful trackers. Yet, the standard approach has been based on correlation or feature selection with minimal consideration given to motion consistency. Thus, there is still a need to capture various physical constraints through motion consistency which will improve accuracy, robustness and more importantly rotation adaptiveness. Therefore, one of the major aspects of this paper is to investigate the outcome of rotation adaptiveness in visual object tracking. Among other key contributions, the paper also includes various consistencies that turn out to be extremely effective in numerous challenging sequences than the current state-of-the-art.

视觉对象跟踪研究在过去的几年里已经有了很大的改进。跟踪范式中的检测方法的出现在许多方面已经相当成功。最近，深度卷积神经网络已被广泛用于大多数成功的跟踪器。然而，标准方法基于相关性或特征选择，而对运动一致性的考虑很少。因此，仍然需要通过运动一致性捕捉各种物理约束，这将提高准确性，鲁棒性以及更重要的旋转适应性。因此，本文的主要内容之一就是研究视觉对象跟踪中旋转自适应的结果。除其他重要贡献外，论文还包括各种一致性，这些一致性在当前最先进的技术水平上在许多具有挑战性的序列中非常有效。
