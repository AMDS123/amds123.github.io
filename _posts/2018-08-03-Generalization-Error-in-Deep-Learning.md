##### Abstract
Deep learning models have lately shown great performance in various fields such as computer vision, speech recognition, speech translation, and natural language processing. However, alongside their state-of-the-art performance, it is still generally unclear what is the source of their generalization ability. Thus, an important question is what makes deep neural networks able to generalize well from the training set to new data. In this article, we provide an overview of the existing theory and bounds for the characterization of the generalization error of deep neural networks, combining both classical and more recent theoretical and empirical results.

深度学习模型最近在计算机视觉，语音识别，语音翻译和自然语言处理等各个领域表现出色。然而，除了他们最先进的表现外，通常还不清楚他们的概括能力的来源是什么。因此，一个重要的问题是什么使深度神经网络能够很好地从训练集推广到新数据。在本文中，我们概述了现有的理论和边界，用于表征深度神经网络的泛化误差，结合经典和最近的理论和实证结果。
