##### Abstract
The vast majority of modern consumer-grade cameras employ a rolling shutter mechanism. In dynamic geometric computer vision applications such as visual SLAM, the so-called rolling shutter effect therefore needs to be properly taken into account. A dedicated relative pose solver appears to be the first problem to solve, as it is of eminent importance to bootstrap any derivation of multi-view geometry. However, despite its significance, it has received inadequate attention to date. This paper presents a detailed investigation of the geometry of the rolling shutter relative pose problem. We introduce the rolling shutter essential matrix, and establish its link to existing models such as the push-broom cameras, summarized in a clean hierarchy of multi-perspective cameras. The generalization of well-established concepts from epipolar geometry is completed by a definition of the Sampson distance in the rolling shutter case. The work is concluded with a careful investigation of the introduced epipolar geometry for rolling shutter cameras on several dedicated benchmarks.

绝大多数现代消费级相机采用卷帘式快门机构。在诸如视觉SLAM的动态几何计算机视觉应用中，因此需要适当考虑所谓的卷帘快门效应。一个专门的相对姿态解算器似乎是第一个需要解决的问题，因为它对引导多视图几何的任何派生具有非常重要的意义。但是，尽管有其重要意义，但迄今尚未得到足够重视。本文提出了卷帘快门相对姿态问题的几何形状的详细研究。我们介绍了卷帘快门基本矩阵，并建立了与现有模型（例如推扫式扫描相机）的链接，总结在一个干净的多视角相机层次结构中。通过在卷帘式快门机箱中Sampson距离的定义来完成对极几何中已经确立的概念的概括。这项工作是在几个专门的基准上仔细研究了卷帘式快门相机的外极几何结构。
