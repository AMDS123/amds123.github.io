##### Abstract
We address the problem of un-supervised geometric image-to-image translation. Rather than transferring the style of an image as a whole, our goal is to translate the geometry of an object as depicted in different domains while preserving its appearance. Towards this goal, we propose a fully un-paired model that performs shape translation within a single model and without the need of additional post-processing stages. Extensive experiments on the VITON, CMU-Multi-PIE and our own FashionStyle datasets show the effectiveness of the proposed method at achieving the task at hand. In addition, we show that despite their low-dimensionality, the features learned by our model have potential for the item retrieval task
