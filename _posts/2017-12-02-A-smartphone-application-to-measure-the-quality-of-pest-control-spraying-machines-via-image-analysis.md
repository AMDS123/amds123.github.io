##### Abstract
The need for higher agricultural productivity has demanded the intensive use of pesticides. However, their correct use depends on assessment methods that can accurately predict how well the pesticides' spraying covered the intended crop region. Some methods have been proposed in the literature, but their high cost and low portability harm their widespread use. This paper proposes and experimentally evaluates a new methodology based on the use of a smartphone-based mobile application, named DropLeaf. Experiments performed using DropLeaf showed that, in addition to its versatility, it can predict with high accuracy the pesticide spraying. DropLeaf is a five-fold image-processing methodology based on: (i) color space conversion, (ii) threshold noise removal, (iii) convolutional operations of dilation and erosion, (iv) detection of contour markers in the water-sensitive card, and, (v) identification of droplets via the marker-controlled watershed transformation. The authors performed successful experiments over two case studies, the first using a set of synthetic cards and the second using a real-world crop. The proposed tool can be broadly used by farmers equipped with conventional mobile phones, improving the use of pesticides with health, environmental and financial benefits.

农业生产力提高的要求要求大量使用农药。然而，其正确使用取决于评估方法，可以准确预测农药喷洒覆盖预定作物区域的情况。文献中已经提出了一些方法，但是它们的高成本和低可移植性损害了它们的广泛使用。本文提出并实验性地评估了一种基于智能手机的移动应用程序DropLeaf的新方法。使用DropLeaf进行的实验表明，除了通用性外，还可以高精度地预测农药喷洒。 DropLeaf是基于以下方面的五重图像处理方法：（i）颜色空间转换，（ii）阈值噪声去除，（iii）膨胀和侵蚀的卷积操作，（iv）在水敏卡中检测轮廓标记（v）通过标记控制的分水岭转化来识别液滴。作者在两个案例研究中进行了成功的实验，第一个使用了一组合成卡片，第二个使用了真实世界的作物。拟议的工具可以广泛地用于配备传统移动电话的农民，从而改善农药对健康，环境和经济效益的使用。
