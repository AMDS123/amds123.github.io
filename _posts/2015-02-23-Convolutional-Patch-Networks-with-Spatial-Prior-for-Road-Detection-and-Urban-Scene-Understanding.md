##### Abstract
Classifying single image patches is important in many different applications, such as road detection or scene understanding. In this paper, we present convolutional patch networks, which are convolutional networks learned to distinguish different image patches and which can be used for pixel-wise labeling. We also show how to incorporate spatial information of the patch as an input to the network, which allows for learning spatial priors for certain categories jointly with an appearance model. In particular, we focus on road detection and urban scene understanding, two application areas where we are able to achieve state-of-the-art results on the KITTI as well as on the LabelMeFacade dataset. Furthermore, our paper offers a guideline for people working in the area and desperately wandering through all the painstaking details that render training CNs on image patches extremely difficult.

在许多不同的应用中，对单个图像块进行分类是很重要的，例如道路检测或场景理解。在本文中，我们提出了卷积网络，这是卷积网络学会区分不同的图像块，并可用于像素标签。我们还展示了如何将补丁的空间信息作为网络的输入，这允许与外观模型一起学习某些类别的空间先验。特别是，我们专注于道路检测和城市场景理解，这两个应用领域能够在KITTI以及LabelMeFacade数据集上实现最新的结果。此外，我们的论文为在该地区工作的人们提供了一个指导方针，并且拼命地在所有细节上徘徊，使得图像补丁上的训练CN非常困难。
