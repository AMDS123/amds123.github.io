##### Abstract
Automated driving systems (ADSs) promise a safe, comfortable and efficient driving experience. However, fatalities involving vehicles equipped with ADSs are on the rise. The full potential of ADSs cannot be realized unless the robustness of state-of-the-art improved further. This paper discusses unsolved problems and surveys the technical aspect of automated driving. Studies regarding present challenges, high-level system architectures, emerging methodologies and core functions: localization, mapping, perception, planning, and human machine interface, were thoroughly reviewed. Furthermore, the state-of-the-art was implemented on our own platform and various algorithms were compared in a real-world driving setting. The paper concludes with an overview of available datasets and tools for ADS development.
