##### Abstract
This paper studies the classification of high-dimensional Gaussian signals from low-dimensional noisy, linear measurements. In particular, it provides upper bounds (sufficient conditions) on the number of measurements required to drive the probability of misclassification to zero in the low-noise regime, both for random measurements and designed ones. Such bounds reveal two important operational regimes that are a function of the characteristics of the source: i) when the number of classes is less than or equal to the dimension of the space spanned by signals in each class, reliable classification is possible in the low-noise regime by using a one-vs-all measurement design; ii) when the dimension of the spaces spanned by signals in each class is lower than the number of classes, reliable classification is guaranteed in the low-noise regime by using a simple random measurement design. Simulation results both with synthetic and real data show that our analysis is sharp, in the sense that it is able to gauge the number of measurements required to drive the misclassification probability to zero in the low-noise regime.

本文研究了低维噪声，线性测量的高维高斯信号的分类问题。特别是，它提供了上限（充分条件）的要求的数量，以推动在低噪声机制的错分概率为零，无论是随机测量和设计的。这样的界限揭示了两个重要的操作机制，它们是源的特征的函数：i）当类的数目小于或等于每个类中的信号跨越的空间的维度时，可靠地分类在低通过使用一对所有测量设计的噪音机制; ii）当每一类信号跨越的空间维数低于类别数时，采用简单的随机测量设计，在低噪声区保证可靠的分类。仿真结果与合成和实际数据都表明，我们的分析是尖锐的，就是说它能够测量在低噪声状态下将错误分类概率驱动为零所需的测量次数。
