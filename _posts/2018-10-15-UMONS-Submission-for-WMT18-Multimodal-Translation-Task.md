##### Abstract
This paper describes the UMONS solution for the Multimodal Machine Translation Task presented at the third conference on machine translation (WMT18). We explore a novel architecture, called deepGRU, based on recent findings in the related task of Neural Image Captioning (NIC). The models presented in the following sections lead to the best METEOR translation score for both constrained (English, image) -> German and (English, image) -> French sub-tasks.
