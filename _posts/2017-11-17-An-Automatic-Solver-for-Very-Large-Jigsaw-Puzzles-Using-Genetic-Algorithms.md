##### Abstract
In this paper we propose the first effective genetic algorithm (GA)-based jigsaw puzzle solver. We introduce a novel crossover procedure that merges two "parent" solutions to an improved "child" configuration by detecting, extracting, and combining correctly assembled puzzle segments. The solver proposed exhibits state-of-the-art performance, as far as handling previously attempted puzzles more accurately and efficiently, as well puzzle sizes that have not been attempted before. The extended experimental results provided in this paper include, among others, a thorough inspection of up to 30,745-piece puzzles (compared to previous attempts on 22,755-piece puzzles), using a considerably faster concurrent implementation of the algorithm. Furthermore, we explore the impact of different phases of the novel crossover operator by experimenting with several variants of the GA. Finally, we compare different fitness functions and their effect on the overall results of the GA-based solver.

在本文中，我们提出了第一个有效的基于遗传算法（GA）的七巧板解算器。我们引入了一种新颖的交叉过程，通过检测，提取和组合正确拼装的拼图片段，将两个“父”解决方案合并为一个改进的“孩子”配置。所提出的解算器展现了最先进的性能，就以前所尝试的谜题而言，更加准确和高效地处理，以及以前没有尝试过的拼图大小。本文提供的扩展实验结果包括对多达30,745个谜题（与以前的22,755个谜题的尝试相比）的彻底检查，使用算法的并行实现相当快。此外，我们通过对GA的几个变体进行实验来探索新型交叉算子不同阶段的影响。最后，我们比较了不同的适应度函数及其对基于遗传算法求解器总体结果的影响。
