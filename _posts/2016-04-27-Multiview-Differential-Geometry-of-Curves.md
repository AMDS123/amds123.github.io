##### Abstract
The field of multiple view geometry has seen tremendous progress in reconstruction and calibration due to methods for extracting reliable point features and key developments in projective geometry. Point features, however, are not available in certain applications and result in unstructured point cloud reconstructions. General image curves provide a complementary feature when keypoints are scarce, and result in 3D curve geometry, but face challenges not addressed by the usual projective geometry of points and algebraic curves. We address these challenges by laying the theoretical foundations of a framework based on the differential geometry of general curves, including stationary curves, occluding contours, and non-rigid curves, aiming at stereo correspondence, camera estimation (including calibration, pose, and multiview epipolar geometry), and 3D reconstruction given measured image curves. By gathering previous results into a cohesive theory, novel results were made possible, yielding three contributions. First we derive the differential geometry of an image curve (tangent, curvature, curvature derivative) from that of the underlying space curve (tangent, curvature, curvature derivative, torsion). Second, we derive the differential geometry of a space curve from that of two corresponding image curves. Third, the differential motion of an image curve is derived from camera motion and the differential geometry and motion of the space curve. The availability of such a theory enables novel curve-based multiview reconstruction and camera estimation systems to augment existing point-based approaches. This theory has been used to reconstruct a "3D curve sketch", to determine camera pose from local curve geometry, and tracking; other developments are underway.

由于提取可靠的点特征和投影几何关键发展的方法，多视点几何领域在重建和校准方面取得了巨大的进展。然而，点特征在某些应用中不可用，并导致非结构化的点云重构。一般的图像曲线在关键点稀缺时提供了一个互补的特征，并且导致三维曲线的几何形状，但是面对常见的投影几何和代数曲线没有解决的挑战。我们针对这些挑战，提出了基于一般曲线的微分几何的框架的理论基础，包括平稳曲线，遮挡轮廓和非刚性曲线，针对立体对应，相机估计（包括校准，姿态和多视图极线几何），并给出测量的图像曲线的三维重建。通过收集以前的结果到一个凝聚力的理论，新的结果成为可能，产生三个贡献。首先我们从下面的空间曲线（切线，曲率，曲率导数，扭转）推导出图像曲线的微分几何（切线，曲率，曲率导数）。其次，我们从两条相应的图像曲线中导出空间曲线的微分几何。第三，从相机运动和空间曲线的微分几何和运动导出图像曲线的差分运动。这种理论的可用性使得新颖的基于曲线的多视图重建和摄像机估计系统能够增强现有的基于点的方法。这个理论已经被用来重建一个“三维曲线草图”，从局部曲线几何图形确定相机的姿态，并跟踪;其他发展正在进行中。
