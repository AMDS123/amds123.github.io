##### Abstract
In computer vision, action recognition refers to the act of classifying an action that is present in a given video and action detection involves locating actions of interest in space and/or time. Videos, which contain photometric information (e.g. RGB, intensity values) in a lattice structure, contain information that can assist in identifying the action that has been imaged. The process of action recognition and detection often begins with extracting useful features and encoding them to ensure that the features are specific to serve the task of action recognition and detection. Encoded features are then processed through a classifier to identify the action class and their spatial and/or temporal locations. In this report, a thorough review of various action recognition and detection algorithms in computer vision is provided by analyzing the two-step process of a typical action recognition and detection algorithm: (i) extraction and encoding of features, and (ii) classifying features into action classes. In efforts to ensure that computer vision-based algorithms reach the capabilities that humans have of identifying actions irrespective of various nuisance variables that may be present within the field of view, the state-of-the-art methods are reviewed and some remaining problems are addressed in the final chapter.

##### Abstract (translated by Google)
在计算机视觉中，动作识别是指对给定视频中存在的动作进行分类，并且动作检测涉及在空间和/或时间中定位感兴趣的动作。包含格子结构中的光度测量信息（例如，RGB，强度值）的视频包含可帮助识别已经成像的动作的信息。动作识别和检测的过程通常从提取有用的特征开始并对其进行编码，以确保这些特征是特定的，以服务于动作识别和检测的任务。然后通过分类器处理编码的特征以识别动作类别及其空间和/或时间位置。在本报告中，通过分析典型的动作识别和检测算法的两步过程，提供了对计算机视觉中的各种动作识别和检测算法的全面回顾：（i）特征的提取和编码，以及（ii）特征的分类进入行动班。为了确保基于计算机视觉的算法达到人类识别行为的能力，而不管视野中可能存在的各种令人讨厌的变量，审查最先进的方法，并留下一些剩余的问题在最后一章中讨论。
