##### Abstract
Due to the complexity of the natural world, a programmer cannot foresee all possible situations, a connected and autonomous vehicle (CAV) will face during its operation, and hence, CAVs will need to learn to make decisions autonomously. Due to the sensing of its surroundings and information exchanged with other vehicles and road infrastructure, a CAV will have access to large amounts of useful data. While different control algorithms have been proposed for CAVs, the benefits brought about by connectedness of autonomous vehicles to other vehicles and to the infrastructure, and its implications on policy learning has not been investigated in literature. This paper investigates a data driven driving policy learning framework through an agent-based modelling approaches. The contributions of the paper are two-fold. A dynamic programming framework is proposed for in-vehicle policy learning with and without connectivity to neighboring vehicles. The simulation results indicate that while a CAV can learn to make autonomous decisions, vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication of information improves this capability. Furthermore, to overcome the limitations of sensing in a CAV, the paper proposes a novel concept for infrastructure-led policy learning and communication with autonomous vehicles. In infrastructure-led policy learning, road-side infrastructure senses and captures successful vehicle maneuvers and learns an optimal policy from those temporal sequences, and when a vehicle approaches the road-side unit, the policy is communicated to the CAV. Deep-imitation learning methodology is proposed to develop such an infrastructure-led policy learning framework.

由于自然世界的复杂性，程序员无法预见所有可能的情况，连接和自动驾驶车辆（CAV）在其操作期间将面临，因此，CAV将需要学习自主地做出决策。由于感知周围环境以及与其他车辆和道路基础设施交换的信息，CAV将能够访问大量有用数据。虽然已经为CAV提出了不同的控制算法，但是自动驾驶车辆与其他车辆和基础设施的连通性带来的好处及其对政策学习的影响尚未在文献中进行过研究。本文通过基于代理的建模方法研究了数据驱动的驾驶策略学习框架。该论文的贡献是双重的。提出了一种动态规划框架，用于车载政策学习，有或没有与邻近车辆的连接。仿真结果表明，虽然CAV可以学习做出自主决策，但是车辆到车辆（V2V）的信息通信提高了这种能力。此外，为了克服CAV中传感的局限性，本文提出了一种新的概念，用于基础设施主导的政策学习和与自动驾驶车辆的通信。在基础设施主导的政策学习中，路边基础设施感知并捕获成功的车辆操纵并从那些时间序列中学习最优策略，并且当车辆接近路侧单元时，策略被传达给CAV。提出了深度模仿学习方法，以开发这种基础设施主导的政策学习框架。
