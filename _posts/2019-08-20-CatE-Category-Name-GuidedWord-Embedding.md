##### Abstract
Unsupervised word embedding has benefited a wide spectrum of NLP tasks due to its effectiveness of encoding word semantics in distributed word representations. However, unsupervised word embedding is a generic representation, not optimized for specific tasks. In this work, we propose a weakly-supervised word embedding framework, CatE. It uses category names to guide word embedding and effectively selects category representative words to regularize the embedding space where the categories are well separated. Experiments show that our model outperforms unsupervised word embedding models significantly on both document classification and category representative words retrieval tasks.
