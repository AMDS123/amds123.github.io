##### Abstract
Unmanned ground vehicles can capture a sub-canopy perspective for plant phenotyping, but their design and construction can be a challenge for scientists unfamiliar with robotics. Here we describe the necessary components and provide guidelines for designing and constructing an autonomous ground robot that can be used for plant phenotyping.
