##### Abstract
We investigate the behavior of maps learned by machine translation methods. The maps translate words by projecting between word embedding spaces of different languages. We locally approximate these maps using linear maps, and find that they vary across the word embedding space. This demonstrates that the underlying maps are non-linear. Importantly, we show that the locally linear maps vary by an amount that is tightly correlated with the distance between the neighborhoods on which they are trained. Our results can be used to test non-linear methods, and to drive the design of more accurate maps for word translation.

我们调查机器翻译方法学习的地图的行为。地图通过在不同语言的词嵌入空间之间进行投影来翻译单词。我们使用线性地图对这些地图进行局部近似，并发现它们在整个单词嵌入空间中变化。这表明底层的地图是非线性的。重要的是，我们显示局部线性地图的变化量与他们受训的街区之间的距离紧密相关。我们的结果可用于测试非线性方法，并推动为词语翻译设计更准确的地图。
