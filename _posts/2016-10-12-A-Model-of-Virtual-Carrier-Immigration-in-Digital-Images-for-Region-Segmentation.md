##### Abstract
A novel model for image segmentation is proposed, which is inspired by the carrier immigration mechanism in physical P-N junction. The carrier diffusing and drifting are simulated in the proposed model, which imitates the physical self-balancing mechanism in P-N junction. The effect of virtual carrier immigration in digital images is analyzed and studied by experiments on test images and real world images. The sign distribution of net carrier at the model's balance state is exploited for region segmentation. The experimental results for both test images and real-world images demonstrate self-adaptive and meaningful gathering of pixels to suitable regions, which prove the effectiveness of the proposed method for image region segmentation.

提出了一种新的基于物理P-N结载流子迁移机制的图像分割模型。模拟了载流子的扩散和漂移，模拟了P-N结中的物理自平衡机制。虚拟载体移民在数字图像中的作用通过对测试图像和真实世界图像的实验进行分析和研究。利用模型平衡状态下网络载体的符号分布进行区域分割。测试图像和实际图像的实验结果证明了自适应和有意义的像素聚集到适当的区域，证明了所提出的图像区域分割方法的有效性。
