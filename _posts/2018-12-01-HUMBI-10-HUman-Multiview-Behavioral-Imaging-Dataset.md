##### Abstract
This paper presents a new dataset called HUMBI - a large corpus of high fidelity models of behavioral signals in 3D from a diverse population measured by a massive multi-camera system. With our novel design of a portable imaging system (consists of 107 HD cameras), we collect human behaviors from 164 subjects across gender, ethnicity, age, and physical condition at a public venue. Using the multiview image streams, we reconstruct high fidelity models of five elementary parts: gaze, face, hands, body, and cloth. As a byproduct, the 3D model provides geometrically consistent image annotation via 2D projection, e.g., body part segmentation. This dataset is a significant departure from the existing human datasets that suffers from subject diversity. We hope the HUMBI opens up a new opportunity for the development for behavioral imaging.
