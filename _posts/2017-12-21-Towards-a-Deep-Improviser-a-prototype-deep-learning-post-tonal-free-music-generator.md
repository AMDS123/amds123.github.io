##### Abstract
Two modest-sized symbolic corpora of post-tonal and post-metric keyboard music have been constructed, one algorithmic, the other improvised. Deep learning models of each have been trained and largely optimised. Our purpose is to obtain a model with sufficient generalisation capacity that in response to a small quantity of separate fresh input seed material, it can generate outputs that are distinctive, rather than recreative of the learned corpora or the seed material. This objective has been first assessed statistically, and as judged by k-sample Anderson-Darling and Cramer tests, has been achieved. Music has been generated using the approach, and informal judgements place it roughly on a par with algorithmic and composed music in related forms. Future work will aim to enhance the model such that it can be evaluated in relation to expression, meaning and utility in real-time performance.

已经构建了两种适度大小的音调后和键盘后音乐的符号语料库，一种是算法，另一种是即兴创作的。各自的深度学习模式已经过训练并在很大程度上得到优化我们的目的是获得一个具有足够泛化能力的模型，以响应少量单独的新鲜输入种子材料，它可以产生独特的输出，而不是重复学习的语料库或种子材料。这个目标已经首先在统计学上进行了评估，并且已经通过k样本Anderson-Darling和Cramer测试来判断。使用这种方法产生了音乐，非正式的判断大致与算法相似，并以相关形式组合音乐。未来的工作将旨在增强模型，使其可以在表达，意义和实时性能的效用方面进行评估。
