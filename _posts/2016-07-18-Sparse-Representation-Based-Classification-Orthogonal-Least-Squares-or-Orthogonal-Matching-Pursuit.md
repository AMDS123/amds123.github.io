##### Abstract
Spare representation of signals has received significant attention in recent years. Based on these developments, a sparse representation-based classification (SRC) has been proposed for a variety of classification and related tasks, including face recognition. Recently, a class dependent variant of SRC was proposed to overcome the limitations of SRC for remote sensing image classification. Traditionally, greedy pursuit based method such as orthogonal matching pursuit (OMP) are used for sparse coefficient recovery due to their simplicity as well as low time-complexity. However, orthogonal least square (OLS) has not yet been widely used in classifiers that exploit the sparse representation properties of data. Since OLS produces lower signal reconstruction error than OMP under similar conditions, we hypothesize that more accurate signal estimation will further improve the classification performance of classifiers that exploiting the sparsity of data. In this paper, we present a classification method based on OLS, which implements OLS in a classwise manner to perform the classification. We also develop and present its kernelized variant to handle nonlinearly separable data. Based on two real-world benchmarking hyperspectral datasets, we demonstrate that class dependent OLS based methods outperform several baseline methods including traditional SRC and the support vector machine classifier.

信号的备用表示近年来受到了很大的关注。基于这些发展，已经提出了用于各种分类和相关任务（包括人脸识别）的基于稀疏表示的分类（SRC）。最近，提出了SRC的类别相关变体来克服SRC对遥感图像分类的限制。传统上，基于贪婪追踪的方法如正交匹配追踪（OMP）由于其简单性和低时间复杂性而被用于稀疏系数恢复。然而，正交最小二乘（OLS）在利用数据稀疏表示属性的分类器中还没有得到广泛的应用。由于OLS在相似条件下产生的信号重建误差比OMP低，因此我们推测更准确的信号估计将进一步提高利用数据稀疏性的分类器的分类性能。在本文中，我们提出了一种基于OLS的分类方法，它以分级的方式实现了OLS分类。我们还开发并呈现其核化变体来处理非线性可分离的数据。基于两个现实世界基准高光谱数据集，我们证明了基于类别OLS的方法胜过了几个基线方法，包括传统的SRC和支持向量机分类器。
