##### Abstract
The field of object detection has made significant advances riding on the wave of region-based ConvNets, but their training procedure still includes many heuristics and hyperparameters that are costly to tune. We present a simple yet surprisingly effective online hard example mining (OHEM) algorithm for training region-based ConvNet detectors. Our motivation is the same as it has always been -- detection datasets contain an overwhelming number of easy examples and a small number of hard examples. Automatic selection of these hard examples can make training more effective and efficient. OHEM is a simple and intuitive algorithm that eliminates several heuristics and hyperparameters in common use. But more importantly, it yields consistent and significant boosts in detection performance on benchmarks like PASCAL VOC 2007 and 2012. Its effectiveness increases as datasets become larger and more difficult, as demonstrated by the results on the MS COCO dataset. Moreover, combined with complementary advances in the field, OHEM leads to state-of-the-art results of 78.9% and 76.3% mAP on PASCAL VOC 2007 and 2012 respectively.

目标检测领域在基于区域的ConvNets的浪潮中取得了重大进展，但是他们的训练过程仍然包含了许多昂贵的启发式算法和超参数。我们提出了一个简单但令人惊讶的有效的在线硬示例挖掘（OHEM）算法训练基于区域的ConvNet探测器。我们的动机与以往一样 - 检测数据集包含大量简单的例子和​​少数几个例子。自动选择这些难题可以使培训更加有效和高效。 OHEM是一个简单而直观的算法，它消除了一些常用的启发式和超参数。但更重要的是，它在PASCAL VOC 2007和2012等基准检测性能上产生了一致而显着的提升。随着MS COCO数据集的结果显示，其数据越来越大，越来越困难，其有效性也越来越高。此外，结合该领域的互补性进展，OHEM在PASCAL VOC 2007和2012年分别推出了78.9％和76.3％mAP的最新成果。
