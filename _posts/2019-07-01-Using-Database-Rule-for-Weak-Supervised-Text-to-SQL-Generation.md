##### Abstract
We present a simple and novel way to do the task of text-to-SQL problem with weak supervision. We call it Rule-SQL. Given the question and the answer from the database table without the SQL logic form, Rule-SQL use the database rules for the SQL exploration first and then use the explored SQL for supervised training. We design several rules for reducing the exploration search space. For the deep model, we leverage BERT for the representation layer and separate the model to SELECT, AGG and WHERE parts. The experiment result on WikiSQL outperforms the strong baseline of full supervision and is comparable to the start-of-the-art weak supervised mothods.
