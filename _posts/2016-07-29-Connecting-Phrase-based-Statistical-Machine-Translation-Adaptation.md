##### Abstract
Although more additional corpora are now available for Statistical Machine Translation (SMT), only the ones which belong to the same or similar domains with the original corpus can indeed enhance SMT performance directly. Most of the existing adaptation methods focus on sentence selection. In comparison, phrase is a smaller and more fine grained unit for data selection, therefore we propose a straightforward and efficient connecting phrase based adaptation method, which is applied to both bilingual phrase pair and monolingual n-gram adaptation. The proposed method is evaluated on IWSLT/NIST data sets, and the results show that phrase based SMT performance are significantly improved (up to +1.6 in comparison with phrase based SMT baseline system and +0.9 in comparison with existing methods).

##### Abstract (translated by Google)
虽然统计机器翻译（SMT）现在还有更多的附加语料库可用，但只有与原始语料库属于相同或相似领域的语料库才能真正提高SMT性能。现有的适应方法大多集中在句子选择上。相比较而言，短语是一个更小，更精细的数据选择单元，因此我们提出了一种简洁高效的基于连接短语的自适应方法，应用于双语短语对和单语n-gram自适应。该方法在IWSLT / NIST数据集上进行评估，结果表明基于短语的SMT性能得到显着改善（与基于SMT的基准系统相比达到+1.6，与现有方法相比+0.9）。
