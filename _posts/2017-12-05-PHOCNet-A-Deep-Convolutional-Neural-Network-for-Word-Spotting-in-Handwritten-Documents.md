##### Abstract
In recent years, deep convolutional neural networks have achieved state of the art performance in various computer vision task such as classification, detection or segmentation. Due to their outstanding performance, CNNs are more and more used in the field of document image analysis as well. In this work, we present a CNN architecture that is trained with the recently proposed PHOC representation. We show empirically that our CNN architecture is able to outperform state of the art results for various word spotting benchmarks while exhibiting short training and test times.

近年来，深卷积神经网络在分类，检测或分割等各种计算机视觉任务中取得了最先进的性能。由于其出色的性能，CNN在文档图像分析领域的应用也越来越多。在这项工作中，我们提出了一个CNN体系结构，它是用最近提出的PHOC表示来训练的。我们凭经验证明，我们的CNN体​​系结构能够在表现短期训练和测试时间的同时，胜过各种基于字词的基准测试的最新技术成果。
