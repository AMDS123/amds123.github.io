##### Abstract
Person re-identification is a popular research topic which aims at matching the specific person in a multi-camera network automatically. Feature representation and metric learning are two important issues for person re-identification. In this paper, we propose a novel person re-identification method, which consists of a reliable representation called Semantic Region Representation (SRR), and an effective metric learning with Mapping Space Topology Constraint (MSTC). The SRR integrates semantic representations to achieve effective similarity comparison between the corresponding regions via parsing the body into multiple parts, which focuses on the foreground context against the background interference. To learn a discriminant metric, the MSTC is proposed to take into account the topological relationship among all samples in the feature space. It considers two-fold constraints: the distribution of positive pairs should be more compact than the average distribution of negative pairs with regard to the same probe, while the average distance between different classes should be larger than that between same classes. These two aspects cooperate to maintain the compactness of the intra-class as well as the sparsity of the inter-class. Extensive experiments conducted on five challenging person re-identification datasets, VIPeR, SYSU-sReID, QUML GRID, CUHK03, and Market-1501, show that the proposed method achieves competitive performance with the state-of-the-art approaches.

人员重新识别是一个热门的研究课题，旨在自动匹配多摄像机网络中的特定人。特征表示和度量学习是人员重新识别的两个重要问题。在本文中，我们提出了一种新的人重新识别方法，它由一个称为语义区域表示（SRR）的可靠表示和一个有效的度量学习与映射空间拓扑约束（MSTC）组成。 SRR集成了语义表示，通过将身体解析为多个部分来实现相应区域之间的有效相似性比较，其侧重于针对背景干扰的前景背景。为了学习判别度量，建议MSTC考虑特征空间中所有样本之间的拓扑关系。它考虑了双重约束：正对的分布应该比相同探针的负对的平均分布更紧凑，而不同类之间的平均距离应该大于相同类之间的平均距离。这两个方面合作，以保持班级的紧凑性以及班级的稀疏性。针对五个具有挑战性的人员重新识别数据集VIPeR，SYSU-sReID，QUML GRID，CUHK03和Market-1501进行的大量实验表明，所提出的方法通过最先进的方法实现了竞争性能。
