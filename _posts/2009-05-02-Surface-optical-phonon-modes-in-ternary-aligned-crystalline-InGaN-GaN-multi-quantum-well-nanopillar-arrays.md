##### Abstract
The optical properties of focused ion beam-engraved perfectly aligned and spatially controlled multi-quantum-well InGaN-GaN nanopillars were investigated. Crystalline MQW nanopillars with a diameter of 30 to 95 nm and high aspect ratios showed a maximum of three-fold enhancement in emission intensity per unit active area. A light emitting contour map of Taiwan is drawn with a nanopillar structure to demonstrate the site control of the technique adopted in the present study. Raman scattering studies were used to characterize the newly created surfaces. Unknown peaks in GaN and InGaN nanostructures are identified for surface optical (SO) phonon modes with proper assignments of wave vectors using multiple excitations, and the SO mode for the ternary phase is reported for the first time.
