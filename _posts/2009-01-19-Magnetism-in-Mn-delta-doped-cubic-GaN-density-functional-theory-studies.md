##### Abstract
The magnetism in 12.5% and 25% Mn delta-doped cubic GaN has been investigated using the density-functional theory calculations. The results show that the single-layer delta-doping and half-delta-doping structures show robust ground state half-metallic ferromagnetism (HMF), and the double-layer delta-doping structure shows robust ground state antiferromagnetism (AFM) with large spin-flip energy of 479.0 meV per Mn-Mn pair. The delta-doping structures show enhanced two-dimensional magnetism. We discuss the origin of the HMF using a simple crystal field model. Finally, we discuss the antiferromagnet/ferromagnet heterostructure based on Mn doped GaN.
