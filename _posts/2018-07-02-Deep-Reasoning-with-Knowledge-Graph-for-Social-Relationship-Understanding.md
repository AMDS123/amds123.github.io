##### Abstract
Social relationships (e.g., friends, couple etc.) form the basis of the social network in our daily life. Automatically interpreting such relationships bears a great potential for the intelligent systems to understand human behavior in depth and to better interact with people at a social level. Human beings interpret the social relationships within a group not only based on the people alone, and the interplay between such social relationships and the contextual information around the people also plays a significant role. However, these additional cues are largely overlooked by the previous studies. We found that the interplay between these two factors can be effectively modeled by a novel structured knowledge graph with proper message propagation and attention. And this structured knowledge can be efficiently integrated into the deep neural network architecture to promote social relationship understanding by an end-to-end trainable Graph Reasoning Model (GRM), in which a propagation mechanism is learned to propagate node message through the graph to explore the interaction between persons of interest and the contextual objects. Meanwhile, a graph attentional mechanism is introduced to explicitly reason about the discriminative objects to promote recognition. Extensive experiments on the public benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of our method over the existing leading competitors.

##### Abstract (translated by Google)
社交关系（例如，朋友，夫妻等）构成了我们日常生活中社交网络的基础。自动解释这种关系具有很大的潜力，使智能系统能够深入了解人类行为，并在社会层面更好地与人们互动。人类不仅仅基于人们来解释群体内的社会关系，而且这种社会关系与人们周围环境信息之间的相互作用也起着重要作用。然而，这些额外的线索在很大程度上被先前的研究所忽视。我们发现这两个因素之间的相互作用可以通过具有适当的消息传播和关注的新颖结构化知识图来有效地建模。这种结构化知识可以有效地集成到深度神经网络体系结构中，通过端到端可训练的图形推理模型（GRM）促进社会关系理解，其中学习传播机制以通过图形传播节点消息以进行探索感兴趣的人和情境对象之间的相互作用。同时，引入图形注意机制来明确推理判别对象以促进识别。公共基准测试的广泛实验证明了我们的方法优于现有的主要竞争对手。
