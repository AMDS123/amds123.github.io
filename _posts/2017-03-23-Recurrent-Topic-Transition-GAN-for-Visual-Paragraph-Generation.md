##### Abstract
A natural image usually conveys rich semantic content and can be viewed from different angles. Existing image description methods are largely restricted by small sets of biased visual paragraph annotations, and fail to cover rich underlying semantics. In this paper, we investigate a semi-supervised paragraph generative framework that is able to synthesize diverse and semantically coherent paragraph descriptions by reasoning over local semantic regions and exploiting linguistic knowledge. The proposed Recurrent Topic-Transition Generative Adversarial Network (RTT-GAN) builds an adversarial framework between a structured paragraph generator and multi-level paragraph discriminators. The paragraph generator generates sentences recurrently by incorporating region-based visual and language attention mechanisms at each step. The quality of generated paragraph sentences is assessed by multi-level adversarial discriminators from two aspects, namely, plausibility at sentence level and topic-transition coherence at paragraph level. The joint adversarial training of RTT-GAN drives the model to generate realistic paragraphs with smooth logical transition between sentence topics. Extensive quantitative experiments on image and video paragraph datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our RTT-GAN in both supervised and semi-supervised settings. Qualitative results on telling diverse stories for an image also verify the interpretability of RTT-GAN.

##### Abstract (translated by Google)
自然的图像通常表达丰富的语义内容，可以从不同的角度来看待。现有的图像描述方法在很大程度上受限于小的有偏见的可视化段落注释，并且不能涵盖丰富的底层语义。在本文中，我们研究了一个半监督的段落生成框架，它能够通过对局部语义区域的推理和利用语言知识来综合多样和语义上连贯的段落描述。所提出的经常主题 - 过渡生成对抗网络（RTT-GAN）在结构化段落生成器和多级段落鉴别器之间构建对抗框架。段落生成器通过在每个步骤中结合基于区域的视觉和语言注意机制而循环生成句子。生成的段落句子的质量由多层次的对抗鉴别者从两个方面进行评估，即句子层面的合理性和段落层面的主题转换一致性。 RTT-GAN联合对抗训练驱动模型生成逼真的段落，句子话题之间逻辑过渡平滑。图像和视频段落数据集的大量定量实验证明了我们的RTT-GAN在监督和半监督环境中的有效性。为图像讲述不同故事的定性结果也验证了RTT-GAN的可解释性。
