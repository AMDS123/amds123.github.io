##### Abstract
Dyadic interactions among humans are marked by speakers continuously influencing and reacting to each other in terms of responses and behaviors, among others. Understanding how interpersonal dynamics affect behavior is important for successful treatment in psychotherapy domains. Traditional schemes that automatically identify behavior for this purpose have often looked at only the target speaker. In this work, we propose a Markov model of how a target speaker's behavior is influenced by their own past behavior as well as their perception of their partner's behavior, based on lexical features. Apart from incorporating additional potentially useful information, our model can also control the degree to which the partner affects the target speaker. We evaluate our proposed model on the task of classifying Negative behavior in Couples Therapy and show that it is more accurate than the single-speaker model. Furthermore, we investigate the degree to which the optimal influence relates to how well a couple does on the long-term, via relating to relationship outcomes

人与人之间的相互作用通过演讲者的反应和行为等不断影响和反应来标志。了解人际动态如何影响行为对心理治疗领域的成功治疗非常重要。为此目的自动识别行为的传统方案通常仅针对目标说话人。在这项工作中，我们基于词汇特征提出了一个马尔可夫模型，说明目标说话者的行为如何受到他们自己过去的行为以及他们对伴侣行为的影响。除了纳入其他潜在有用的信息外，我们的模型还可以控制合作伙伴对目标发言人的影响程度。我们评估我们提出的模型，对夫妻治疗中的负性行为进行分类，并证明它比单人模型更准确。此外，我们调查了最佳影响力与一对夫妇长期有多好的关系的程度，通过与关系结果相关
