##### Abstract
Reducing the number of pixels in video signals while maintaining quality needed for recovering the trace of an object using Compressive Sensing is main subject of this work. Quality of frames, from video that contains moving object, are gradually reduced by keeping different number of pixels in each iteration, going from 45% all the way to 1%. Using algorithm for tracing object, results were satisfactory and showed mere changes in trajectory graphs, obtained from original and reconstructed videos.
