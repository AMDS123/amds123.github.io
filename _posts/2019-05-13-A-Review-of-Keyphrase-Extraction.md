##### Abstract
Automated keyphrase extraction is a crucial textual information processing task regarding the most types of digital content management systems. It concerns the selection of representative and characteristic phrases from a document that express all aspects related to its content. This article introduces the task of keyphrase extraction and provides a view of existing work that is well organized and comprehensive. Moreover, it discusses the different evaluation approaches giving meaningful insights and highlighting open issues. Finally, a comparative experimental study for popular unsupervised techniques on five datasets is presented.
