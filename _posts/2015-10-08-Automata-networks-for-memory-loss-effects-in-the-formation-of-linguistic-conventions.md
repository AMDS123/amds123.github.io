##### Abstract
This work attempts to give new theoretical insights to the absence of intermediate stages in the evolution of language. In particular, it is developed an automata networks approach to a crucial question: how a population of language users can reach agreement on a linguistic convention? To describe the appearance of sharp transitions in the self-organization of language, it is adopted an extremely simple model of (working) memory. At each time step, language users simply loss part of their word-memories. Through computer simulations of low-dimensional lattices, it appear sharp transitions at critical values that depend on the size of the vicinities of the individuals.
