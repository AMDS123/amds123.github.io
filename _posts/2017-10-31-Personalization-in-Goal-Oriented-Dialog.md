##### Abstract
The main goal of modeling human conversation is to create agents which can interact with people in both open-ended and goal-oriented scenarios. End-to-end trained neural dialog systems are an important line of research for such generalized dialog models as they do not resort to any situation-specific handcrafting of rules. However, incorporating personalization into such systems is a largely unexplored topic as there are no existing corpora to facilitate such work. In this paper, we present a new dataset of goal-oriented dialogs which are influenced by speaker profiles attached to them. We analyze the shortcomings of an existing end-to-end dialog system based on Memory Networks and propose modifications to the architecture which enable personalization. We also investigate personalization in dialog as a multi-task learning problem, and show that a single model which shares features among various profiles outperforms separate models for each profile.

建模人类对话的主要目标是创建可以在开放式和目标导向场景中与人员进行交互的代理。端对端训练的神经对话系统是这样的广义对话模型的重要研究线，因为它们不会诉诸任何情况特定的规则手工。然而，将个性化纳入这样的系统是一个很大程度上未被探索的主题，因为没有现成的语料库来促进这样的工作。在本文中，我们提出了一个新的面向目标的对话框数据集，受到扬声器配置文件的影响。我们分析了基于内存网络的现有端到端对话系统的缺点，并提出了对个性化架构的修改。我们还将对话中的个性化作为一个多任务学习问题进行研究，并且显示出在各个配置文件之间共享特征的单个模型优于每个配置文件的单独模型。
