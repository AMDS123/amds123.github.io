##### Abstract
A model based on optical phonon scattering is developed to explain peculiarities in the current drive, transconductance, and high speed behavior of short gate length GaN transistors. The model is able to resolve these peculiarities, and provides a simple way to explain transistor behavior in any semiconductor material system in which electron-optical phonon scattering is strong.
