##### Abstract
Fine-grained vehicle classification is the task of classifying make, model, and year of a vehicle. This is a very challenging task, because vehicles of different types but similar color and viewpoint can often look much more similar than vehicles of same type but differing color and viewpoint. Vehicle make, model, and year in com- bination with vehicle color - are of importance in several applications such as vehicle search, re-identification, tracking, and traffic analysis. In this work we investigate the suitability of several recent landmark convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures, which have shown top results on large scale image classification tasks, for the task of fine-grained classification of vehicles. We compare the performance of the networks VGG16, several ResNets, Inception architectures, the recent DenseNets, and MobileNet. For classification we use the Stanford Cars-196 dataset which features 196 different types of vehicles. We investigate several aspects of CNN training, such as data augmentation and training from scratch vs. fine-tuning. Importantly, we introduce no aspects in the architectures or training process which are specific to vehicle classification. Our final model achieves a state-of-the-art classification accuracy of 94.6% outperforming all related works, even approaches which are specifically tailored for the task, e.g. by including vehicle part detections.

细粒度车辆分类是对车辆的品牌，型号和年份进行分类的任务。这是一项非常具有挑战性的任务，因为不同类型但相似颜色和视点的车辆通常看起来比相同类型但不同颜色和视点的车辆更加相似。车辆品牌，型号和年份与车辆颜色相结合 - 在车辆搜索，重新识别，追踪和交通分析等多种应用中具有重要意义。在这项工作中，我们调查了几个最近的具有里程碑意义的卷积神经网络（CNN）架构的适用性，该架构在大规模图像分类任务中显示出最佳结果，用于车辆的细粒度分类任务。我们比较网络VGG16，几个ResNets，初始体系结构，最近的DenseNets和MobileNet的性能。对于分类，我们使用具有196种不同类型车辆的斯坦福汽车-196数据集。我们调查CNN培训的几个方面，如数据增强和从头开始与微调的培训。重要的是，我们没有在架构或训练过程中引入特定于车辆分类的方面。我们的最终模型达到了超过所有相关作品的94.6％的最新分类准确率，甚至是专门针对该任务定制的方法，例如，通过包括车辆部分检测。
