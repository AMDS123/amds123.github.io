##### Abstract
Brain is an organ that controls activities of all the parts of the body. Recognition of automated brain tumor in Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a difficult task due to complexity of size and location variability. This automatic method detects all the type of cancer present in the body. Previous methods for tumor are time consuming and less accurate. In the present work, statistical analysis morphological and thresholding techniques are used to process the images obtained by MRI. Feed-forward back-prop neural network is used to classify the performance of tumors part of the image. This method results high accuracy and less iterations detection which further reduces the consumption time.

大脑是控制身体所有部位活动的器官。磁共振成像（MRI）中自动化脑肿瘤的识别是一项艰巨的任务，由于尺寸和位置变化的复杂性。这种自动方法可以检测到身体中存在的所有类型的癌症。先前的肿瘤方法耗时且不准确。在目前的工作中，统计分析使用形态学和阈值技术来处理由MRI获得的图像。前馈后向神经网络用于分类图像中肿瘤部分的表现。这种方法的精度高，迭代次数少，进一步缩短了消耗时间。
