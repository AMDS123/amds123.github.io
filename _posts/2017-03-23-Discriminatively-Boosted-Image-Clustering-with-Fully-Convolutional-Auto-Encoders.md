##### Abstract
Traditional image clustering methods take a two-step approach, feature learning and clustering, sequentially. However, recent research results demonstrated that combining the separated phases in a unified framework and training them jointly can achieve a better performance. In this paper, we first introduce fully convolutional auto-encoders for image feature learning and then propose a unified clustering framework to learn image representations and cluster centers jointly based on a fully convolutional auto-encoder and soft $k$-means scores. At initial stages of the learning procedure, the representations extracted from the auto-encoder may not be very discriminative for latter clustering. We address this issue by adopting a boosted discriminative distribution, where high score assignments are highlighted and low score ones are de-emphasized. With the gradually boosted discrimination, clustering assignment scores are discriminated and cluster purities are enlarged. Experiments on several vision benchmark datasets show that our methods can achieve a state-of-the-art performance.

传统的图像聚类方法依次采用两步法，特征学习和聚类。然而，最近的研究结果表明，将分离的阶段结合在一个统一的框架中并共同训练可以获得更好的性能。本文首先引入全卷积自动编码器进行图像特征学习，然后提出一个统一的聚类框架，以全卷积自编码器和软k $ -means分数为基础联合学习图像表示和聚类中心。在学习过程的初始阶段，从自动编码器提取的表示对于后一种聚类可能不是很有区别的。我们通过采用强化的差异分布来解决这个问题，其中高分数分配被强调，低分数分配不被强调。随着歧视的逐渐增强，聚类分配得分被区分，并且聚类纯度被扩大。在几个视觉基准数据集上的实验表明，我们的方法可以达到最新的性能。
