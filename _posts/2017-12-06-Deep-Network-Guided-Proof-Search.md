##### Abstract
Deep learning techniques lie at the heart of several significant AI advances in recent years including object recognition and detection, image captioning, machine translation, speech recognition and synthesis, and playing the game of Go. Automated first-order theorem provers can aid in the formalization and verification of mathematical theorems and play a crucial role in program analysis, theory reasoning, security, interpolation, and system verification. Here we suggest deep learning based guidance in the proof search of the theorem prover E. We train and compare several deep neural network models on the traces of existing ATP proofs of Mizar statements and use them to select processed clauses during proof search. We give experimental evidence that with a hybrid, two-phase approach, deep learning based guidance can significantly reduce the average number of proof search steps while increasing the number of theorems proved. Using a few proof guidance strategies that leverage deep neural networks, we have found first-order proofs of 7.36% of the first-order logic translations of the Mizar Mathematical Library theorems that did not previously have ATP generated proofs. This increases the ratio of statements in the corpus with ATP generated proofs from 56% to 59%.

深度学习技术是近年来人工智能领域的一大进步，其中包括对象识别与检测，图像字幕，机器翻译，语音识别与合成，玩Go游戏等。自动一阶定理证明可以辅助数学定理的形式化和验证，在程序分析，理论推理，安全性，插值和系统验证等方面起着至关重要的作用。这里我们建议在定理证明者E的证明搜索中使用基于深度学习的指导。我们训练和比较几个深度神经网络模型，对现有的Mizar陈述的ATP证据的痕迹进行比较，并在证明搜索中使用它们来选择处理的子句。我们给出的实验证据表明，采用混合两相方法，基于深度学习的引导可以显着减少证明搜索步骤的平均数量，同时增加证明的定理数量。利用一些证明性的指导性策略，利用深度神经网络，我们发现了先前没有ATP生成证据的Mizar数学图书馆定​​理的一阶逻辑译文的7.36％的一阶证明。这增加了语料库中与ATP产生的证据比例从56％到59％。
