##### Abstract
A longstanding question in computer vision concerns the representation of 3D shapes for recognition: should 3D shapes be represented with descriptors operating on their native 3D formats, such as voxel grid or polygon mesh, or can they be effectively represented with view-based descriptors? We address this question in the context of learning to recognize 3D shapes from a collection of their rendered views on 2D images. We first present a standard CNN architecture trained to recognize the shapes' rendered views independently of each other, and show that a 3D shape can be recognized even from a single view at an accuracy far higher than using state-of-the-art 3D shape descriptors. Recognition rates further increase when multiple views of the shapes are provided. In addition, we present a novel CNN architecture that combines information from multiple views of a 3D shape into a single and compact shape descriptor offering even better recognition performance. The same architecture can be applied to accurately recognize human hand-drawn sketches of shapes. We conclude that a collection of 2D views can be highly informative for 3D shape recognition and is amenable to emerging CNN architectures and their derivatives.

计算机视觉领域一个长期存在的问题涉及三维形状的识别：3D形状是否应该用描述符来操作，如体素网格或多边形网格，还是可以用基于视图的描述符来有效地表示？我们在学习从二维图像渲染视图集合中识别三维形状的过程中解决了这个问题。我们首先提出了一个标准CNN架构，可以独立识别各个形状的渲染视图，并且可以从一个视图中识别3D形状，其准确度远高于使用最先进的3D形状描述。提供形状的多个视图时，识别率进一步提高。此外，我们提出了一种新颖的CNN体​​系结构，它将来自三维形状的多个视图的信息组合成单一且紧凑的形状描述符，从而提供更好的识别性能。可以应用相同的体系结构来准确地识别人形的手绘草图。我们得出结论：2D视图的集合可以为3D形状识别提供高度的信息，并且适用于新兴的CNN体​​系结构及其衍生物。
