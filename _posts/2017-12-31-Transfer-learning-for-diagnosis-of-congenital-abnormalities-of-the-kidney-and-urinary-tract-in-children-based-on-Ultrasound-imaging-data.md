##### Abstract
Classification of ultrasound (US) kidney images for diagnosis of congenital abnormalities of the kidney and urinary tract (CAKUT) in children is a challenging task. It is desirable to improve existing pattern classification models that are built upon conventional image features. In this study, we propose a transfer learning-based method to extract imaging features from US kidney images in order to improve the CAKUT diagnosis in children. Particularly, a pre-trained deep learning model (imagenet-caffe-alex) is adopted for transfer learning-based feature extraction from 3-channel feature maps computed from US images, including original images, gradient features, and distanced transform features. Support vector machine classifiers are then built upon different sets of features, including the transfer learning features, conventional imaging features, and their combination. Experimental results have demonstrated that the combination of transfer learning features and conventional imaging features yielded the best classification performance for distinguishing CAKUT patients from normal controls based on their US kidney images.

超声（美国）肾图像分类诊断先天性肾脏和泌尿系统异常（CAKUT）是一项具有挑战性的任务。改进现有的基于传统图像特征的模式分类模型是可取的。在这项研究中，我们提出了一种基于转移学习的方法从美国肾脏图像提取成像特征，以改善儿童CAKUT诊断。特别地，从US图像计算的三通道特征地图（包括原始图像，梯度特征和距离变换特征）采用预先训练的深度学习模型（imagenet-caffe-alex）用于基于传递学习的特征提取。支持向量机分类器然后建立在不同的特征集上，包括传输学习特征，传统的成像特征以及它们的组合。实验结果表明，转移学习功能和常规成像功能相结合，根据美国肾脏图像，将CAKUT患者与正常对照区分开来，具有最佳的分类性能。
