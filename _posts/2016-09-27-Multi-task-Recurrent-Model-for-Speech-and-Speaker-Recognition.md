##### Abstract
Although highly correlated, speech and speaker recognition have been regarded as two independent tasks and studied by two communities. This is certainly not the way that people behave: we decipher both speech content and speaker traits at the same time. This paper presents a unified model to perform speech and speaker recognition simultaneously and altogether. The model is based on a unified neural network where the output of one task is fed to the input of the other, leading to a multi-task recurrent network. Experiments show that the joint model outperforms the task-specific models on both the two tasks.

虽然高度相关，言语和说话人识别被视为两个独立的任务，并由两个社区研究。这当然不是人们行为的方式：我们同时破译言语内容和说话者特征。本文提出了一个统一的模型来同时进行语音和说话人识别。该模型基于统一的神经网络，其中一个任务的输出被馈送到另一个的输入，从而导致多任务循环网络。实验表明，联合模型在两个任务上都优于任务特定的模型。
