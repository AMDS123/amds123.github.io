##### Abstract
Computer based recognition and detection of abnormalities in ECG signals is proposed. For this purpose, the Support Vector Machines (SVM) are combined with the advantages of Hermite transform representation. SVM represent a special type of classification techniques commonly used in medical applications. Automatic classification of ECG could make the work of cardiologic departments faster and more efficient. It would also reduce the number of false diagnosis and, as a result, save lives. The working principle of the SVM is based on translating the data into a high dimensional feature space and separating it using a linear classificator. In order to provide an optimal representation for SVM application, the Hermite transform domain is used. This domain is proved to be suitable because of the similarity of the QRS complex with Hermite basis functions. The maximal signal information is obtained using a small set of features that are used for detection of irregular QRS complexes. The aim of the paper is to show that these features can be employed for automatic ECG signal analysis.

提出了基于计算机的心电信号异常识别与检测方法。为此，支持向量机（SVM）结合了Hermite变换表示的优点。 SVM代表了医疗应用中常用的一种特殊的分类技术。心电图的自动分类可以使心脏科的工作更快，更高效。这也会减少错误诊断的次数，从而挽救生命。 SVM的工作原理是基于将数据转换成高维特征空间，并使用线性分类器将其分离。为了提供SVM应用的最佳表示，使用Hermite变换域。由于QRS波群与Hermite基函数的相似性，该域被证明是合适的。使用用于检测不规则QRS波群的一小组特征来获得最大信号信息。本文的目的是表明这些功能可以用于自动心电信号分析。
