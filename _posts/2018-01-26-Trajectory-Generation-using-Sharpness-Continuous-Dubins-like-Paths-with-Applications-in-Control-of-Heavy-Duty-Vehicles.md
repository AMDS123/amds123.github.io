##### Abstract
We present a trajectory generation framework for control of wheeled vehicles under steering actuator constraints. The motivation is smooth autonomous driving of heavy vehicles. The key idea is to take into account rate, and additionally, torque limitations of the steering actuator directly. Previous methods only take into account curvature rate limitations, which deal indirectly with steering rate limitations. We propose the new concept of Sharpness Continuous curves, which uses cubic and sigmoid curvature trajectories together with circular arcs to steer the vehicle. The obtained trajectories are characterized by a smooth and continuously differentiable steering angle profile. These trajectories provide low-level controllers with reference signals which are easier to track, resulting in improved performance. The smoothness of the obtained steering profiles also results in increased passenger comfort. The method is characterized by a fast computation time, which can be further speeded up through the use of simple pre-computations. We detail possible path planning applications of the method, and conduct simulations that show its advantages and real time capabilities.

我们提出了一个轨道生成框架控制轮式车辆在转向执行器的约束下。动力是重型车辆平稳自主驾驶。主要思想是直接考虑转向执行机构的转速限制。以前的方法只考虑曲率比率限制，间接处理转向率限制。我们提出了清晰度连续曲线的新概念，它使用三次和S形曲率轨迹连同圆弧来引导车辆。所获得的轨迹的特征在于光滑且连续可微的转向角轮廓。这些轨迹为低级控制器提供了更容易跟踪的参考信号，从而提高了性能。所获得的转向轮廓的平滑度也导致乘客舒适度增加。该方法的特征在于快速的计算时间，其可以通过使用简单的预先计算而进一步加速。我们详细介绍了该方法的可能路径规划应用，并进行了仿真，展示了它的优点和实时性能。
