##### Abstract
In this paper, the current state of security in robotics is described to be in need of review. When we consider safety mechanisms implemented in an Internet-connected robot, the requirement of safety becomes a crucial security requirement. Upon review of the current state of security in the field of robotics, four key requirements are in need of addressing: the supply chain for calibration, integrity and authenticity of commands (i.e. in teleoperation), physical-plane security and finally, secure, controlled logging and auditing.
