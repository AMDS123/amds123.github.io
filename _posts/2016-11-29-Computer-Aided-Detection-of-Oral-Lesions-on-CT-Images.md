##### Abstract
Oral lesions are important findings on computed tomography (CT) images. In this study, a fully automatic method to detect oral lesions in mandibular region from dental CT images is proposed. Two methods were developed to recognize two types of lesions namely (1) Close border (CB) lesions and (2) Open border (OB) lesions, which cover most of the lesion types that can be found on CT images. For the detection of CB lesions, fifteen features were extracted from each initial lesion candidates and multi layer perceptron (MLP) neural network was used to classify suspicious regions. Moreover, OB lesions were detected using a rule based image processing method, where no feature extraction or classification algorithm were used. The results were validated using a CT dataset of 52 patients, where 22 patients had abnormalities and 30 patients were normal. Using non-training dataset, CB detection algorithm yielded 71% sensitivity with 0.31 false positives per patient. Furthermore, OB detection algorithm achieved 100% sensitivity with 0.13 false positives per patient. Results suggest that, the proposed framework, which consists of two methods, has the potential to be used in clinical context, and assist radiologists for better diagnosis.

口腔病变是计算机断层扫描（CT）图像的重要发现。在这项研究中，提出了一种全自动方法从牙齿CT图像中检测下颌骨区域的口腔病变。两种方法被发展为识别两种类型的病变，即（1）关闭边界（CB）病变和（2）开放边界（OB）病变，其覆盖了CT图像上可发现的大部分病变类型。为了检测CB病变，从每个初始病变候选中提取15个特征，并使用多层感知器（MLP）神经网络对可疑区域进行分类。此外，使用基于规则的图像处理方法来检测OB病变，其中不使用特征提取或分类算法。使用52名患者的CT数据验证结果，其中22名患者异常，30名患者正常。使用非训练数据集，CB检测算法产生71％的敏感性，每名患者0.31个假阳性。此外，OB检测算法达到了100％的灵敏度，每个病人0.13个误报。结果表明，提出的框架由两种方法组成，具有在临床上使用的潜力，并有助于放射科医师更好的诊断。
