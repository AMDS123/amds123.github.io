##### Abstract
The 3-D total variation (3DTV) is a powerful regularization term, which encodes the local smoothness prior structure underlying a hyper-spectral image (HSI), for general HSI processing tasks. This term is calculated by assuming identical and independent sparsity structures on all bands of gradient maps calculated along spatial and spectral HSI modes. This, however, is always largely deviated from the real cases, where the gradient maps are generally with different while correlated sparsity structures across all their bands. Such deviation tends to hamper the performance of the related method by adopting such prior term. To this is- sue, this paper proposes an enhanced 3DTV (E-3DTV) regularization term beyond conventional 3DTV. Instead of imposing sparsity on gradient maps themselves, the new term calculated sparsity on the subspace bases on the gradient maps along their bands, which naturally encode the correlation and difference across these bands, and more faithfully reflect the insightful configurations of an HSI. The E-3DTV term can easily replace the previous 3DTV term and be em- bedded into an HSI processing model to ameliorate its performance. The superiority of the proposed methods is substantiated by extensive experiments on two typical related tasks: HSI denoising and compressed sensing, as compared with state-of-the-arts designed for both tasks.

3-D总变差（3DTV）是一个强大的正则化项，它对高光谱图像（HSI）下的局部平滑先验结构进行编码，用于一般的HSI处理任务。该项通过假设沿空间和光谱HSI模式计算的梯度图的所有带上的相同且独立的稀疏性结构来计算。然而，这总是在很大程度上偏离了实际情况，其中梯度图通常具有不同的相关稀疏度结构，跨越其所有频带。这种偏差倾向于通过采用这样的先前术语来妨碍相关方法的执行。为此，本文提出了一种超越传统3DTV的增强型3DTV（E-3DTV）正则化术语。新的术语不是对梯度图本身施加稀疏性，而是计算子空间上的稀疏度，这些稀疏性基于沿着它们的波段的梯度图，这自然地编码了这些波段之间的相关性和差异，并且更忠实地反映了HSI的洞察性配置。 E-3DTV术语可以轻松取代之前的3DTV术语，并嵌入到HSI处理模型中以改善其性能。通过对两个典型相关任务的广泛实验证实了所提出方法的优越性：HSI去噪和压缩感知，与为这两个任务设计的现有技术相比。
