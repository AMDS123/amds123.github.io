##### Abstract
We look into robustness of deep learning based MRI reconstruction when tested on unseen contrasts and organs. We then propose to generalise the network by training with large publicly-available natural image datasets with synthesised phase information to achieve high cross-domain reconstruction performance which is competitive with domain-specific training. To explain its generalisation mechanism, we have also analysed patch sets for different training datasets.
