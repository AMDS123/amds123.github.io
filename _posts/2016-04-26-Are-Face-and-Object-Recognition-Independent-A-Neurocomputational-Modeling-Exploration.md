##### Abstract
Are face and object recognition abilities independent? Although it is commonly believed that they are, Gauthier et al.(2014) recently showed that these abilities become more correlated as experience with nonface categories increases. They argued that there is a single underlying visual ability, v, that is expressed in performance with both face and nonface categories as experience grows. Using the Cambridge Face Memory Test and the Vanderbilt Expertise Test, they showed that the shared variance between Cambridge Face Memory Test and Vanderbilt Expertise Test performance increases monotonically as experience increases. Here, we address why a shared resource across different visual domains does not lead to competition and to an inverse correlation in abilities? We explain this conundrum using our neurocomputational model of face and object processing (The Model, TM). Our results show that, as in the behavioral data, the correlation between subordinate level face and object recognition accuracy increases as experience grows. We suggest that different domains do not compete for resources because the relevant features are shared between faces and objects. The essential power of experience is to generate a "spreading transform" for faces that generalizes to objects that must be individuated. Interestingly, when the task of the network is basic level categorization, no increase in the correlation between domains is observed. Hence, our model predicts that it is the type of experience that matters and that the source of the correlation is in the fusiform face area, rather than in cortical areas that subserve basic level categorization. This result is consistent with our previous modeling elucidating why the FFA is recruited for novel domains of expertise (Tong et al., 2008).

面部和对象识别能力是否独立？ Gauthier等（2014）最近表明，尽管人们普遍相信这些能力会随着非表面类别的经验的增加而变得更加相关。他们认为，有一个单一的基本视觉能力，v，表现为随着经验的增长，脸部和非脸部类别的表现。使用剑桥人脸记忆测试和范德比尔特专家测验，他们发现剑桥人脸记忆测验和范德比尔特专业测验表现之间的共同差异随着经验的增加而单调增加。在这里，我们解释了为什么跨不同视域的共享资源不会导致竞争和能力的逆向关联？我们使用面部和对象处理（The Model，TM）的神经计算模型来解释这个难题。我们的研究结果表明，与行为数据一样，随着经验的增长，下级人脸与对象识别准确率之间的相关性也随之增加。我们建议不同的域名不要竞争资源，因为相关的功能是在面孔和对象之间共享的。经验的基本力量是产生一个面向对象的“扩散变换”，这个变换必须被个体化。有趣的是，当网络的任务是基本级分类时，没有观察到域之间相关性的增加。因此，我们的模型预测，这是一种重要的经验类型，相关性的来源是在梭形面部区域，而不是在皮质区域进行基本层次的分类。这个结果与我们以前的模型一致，阐明了FFA为什么被招募用于新的专业领域（Tong et al。，2008）。
