##### Abstract
Reinforcement Learning (RL) is a learning paradigm concerned with learning to control a system so as to maximize an objective over the long term. This approach to learning has received immense interest in recent times and success manifests itself in the form of human-level performance on games like \textit{Go}. While RL is emerging as a practical component in real-life systems, most successes have been in Single Agent domains. This report will instead specifically focus on challenges that are unique to Multi-Agent Systems interacting in mixed cooperative and competitive environments. The report concludes with advances in the paradigm of training Multi-Agent Systems called \textit{Decentralized Actor, Centralized Critic}, based on an extension of MDPs called \textit{Decentralized Partially Observable MDP}s, which has seen a renewed interest lately.

##### Abstract (translated by Google)
强化学习（RL）是一种学习范式，涉及学习控制系统以最大化长期目标。这种学习方法近来受到极大的关注，成功体现在像\ textit {Go}等游戏中的人类表现形式。虽然RL正在成为现实生活系统中的实用组件，但大多数成功都在单一代理域中。相反，本报告将专注于Multi-Agent Systems在混合合作和竞争环境中进行交互所特有的挑战。该报告最后根据MDP的扩展名为\ textit {Decentralized Actor，Centralized Critic}进行了多代理系统训练范式的进展，该扩展名为\ textit {Decentralized Partially Observable MDP}，最近引起了人们的兴趣。
