##### Abstract
When a measurement falls outside the quantization or measurable range, it becomes saturated and cannot be used in classical reconstruction methods. For example, in C-arm angiography systems, which provide projection radiography, fluoroscopy, digital subtraction angiography, and are widely used for medical diagnoses and interventions, the limited dynamic range of C-arm flat detectors leads to overexposure in some projections during an acquisition, such as imaging relatively thin body parts (e.g., the knee). Aiming at overexposure correction for computed tomography (CT) reconstruction, we in this paper propose a mixed one-bit compressive sensing (M1bit-CS) to acquire information from both regular and saturated measurements. This method is inspired by the recent progress on one-bit compressive sensing, which deals with only sign observations. Its successful applications imply that information carried by saturated measurements is useful to improve recovery quality. For the proposed M1bit-CS model, alternating direction methods of multipliers is developed and an iterative saturation detection scheme is established. Then we evaluate M1bit-CS on one-dimensional signal recovery tasks. In some experiments, the performance of the proposed algorithms on mixed measurements is almost the same as recovery on unsaturated ones with the same amount of measurements. Finally, we apply the proposed method to overexposure correction for CT reconstruction on a phantom and a simulated clinical image. The results are promising, as the typical streaking artifacts and capping artifacts introduced by saturated projection data are effectively reduced, yielding significant error reduction compared with existing algorithms based on extrapolation.

当测量值超出量化或可测量范围时，它会变得饱和，不能用于经典的重建方法。例如，在C形臂血管造影系统中，提供投影X线摄影，荧光检查，数字减影血管造影术，并且广泛用于医学诊断和干预，C臂平面检测器的有限动态范围导致在采集期间的一些投影中的过度曝光例如对相对较薄的身体部位（例如膝盖）进行成像。针对计算机断层扫描（CT）重建过度曝光校正问题，本文提出了一种混合式一位压缩传感（M1bit-CS），用于从正常和饱和测量中获取信息。这种方法的灵感来自最近在一点压缩感测方面的进展，它只处理符号观测。其成功的应用意味着饱和测量所携带的信息有助于提高恢复质量。对于所提出的M1bit-CS模型，开发了乘法器的交替方向方法，并建立了迭代饱和检测方案。然后我们评估一维信号恢复任务中的M1bit-CS。在一些实验中，所提出的混合测量算法的性能与具有相同测量量的非饱和算法的恢复性能几乎相同。最后，我们将所提出的方法应用于在假体和模拟临床图像上的CT重建的过度曝光校正。结果是有希望的，因为饱和投影数据所引入的典型的条纹伪影和覆盖伪像被有效地减少，与现有的基于外插的算法相比产生显着的误差减小。
