##### Abstract
Gibson et al. (2017) argued that color naming is shaped by patterns of communicative need. In support of this claim, they showed that color naming systems across languages support more precise communication about warm colors than cool colors, and that the objects we talk about tend to be warm-colored rather than cool-colored. Here, we present new analyses that alter this picture. We show that greater communicative precision for warm than for cool colors, and greater communicative need, may both be explained by perceptual structure. However, using an information-theoretic analysis, we also show that color naming across languages bears signs of communicative need beyond what would be predicted by perceptual structure alone. We conclude that color naming is shaped both by perceptual structure, as has traditionally been argued, and by patterns of communicative need, as argued by Gibson et al. - although for reasons other than those they advanced.

##### Abstract (translated by Google)
吉布森等人。 （2017）认为颜色命名是由交际需要的模式所塑造的。为了支持这一说法，他们表明，不同语言的颜色命名系统支持关于暖色调的比冷色调更为精确的沟通，并且我们所谈论的对象往往是暖色的而不是冷色的。在这里，我们提出改变这张照片的新分析。我们表明，对于暖色调而言，较之冷色调以及更大的交际需求，交际精度更高，都可以用感知结构来解释。然而，使用信息论分析，我们还表明，跨语言的颜色命名带有交际需求的迹象，超出了单凭感知结构预测的结果。我们得出这样的结论：颜色命名是由传统上认为的感知结构以及由Gibson等人提出的沟通需要模式来塑造的。 - 虽然由于他们推进以外的原因。
