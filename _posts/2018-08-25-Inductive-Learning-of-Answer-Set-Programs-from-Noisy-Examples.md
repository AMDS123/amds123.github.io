##### Abstract
In recent years, non-monotonic Inductive Logic Programming has received growing interest. Specifically, several new learning frameworks and algorithms have been introduced for learning under the answer set semantics, allowing the learning of common-sense knowledge involving defaults and exceptions, which are essential aspects of human reasoning. In this paper, we present a noise-tolerant generalisation of the learning from answer sets framework. We evaluate our ILASP3 system, both on synthetic and on real datasets, represented in the new framework. In particular, we show that on many of the datasets ILASP3 achieves a higher accuracy than other ILP systems that have previously been applied to the datasets, including a recently proposed differentiable learning framework.

近年来，非单调感应逻辑编程受到越来越多的关注。具体而言，已经引入了几种新的学习框架和算法用于在答案集语义下学习，允许学习涉及默认和异常的常识知识，这是人类推理的基本方面。在本文中，我们从答案集框架中提出了一种容忍噪声的学习概括。我们评估我们的ILASP3系统，包括新框架中表示的合成和真实数据集。特别地，我们表明，在许多数据集中，ILASP3比先前已应用于数据集的其他ILP系统实现更高的准确性，包括最近提出的可区分学习框架。
