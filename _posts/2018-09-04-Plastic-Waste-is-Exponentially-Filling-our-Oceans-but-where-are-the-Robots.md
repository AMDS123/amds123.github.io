##### Abstract
Plastic waste is filling our oceans at an exponential rate. The situation is catastrophic and has now garnered worldwide attention. Despite the catastrophic conditions, little to no robotics research is conducted in the identification, collection, sorting, and removal of plastic waste from oceans and rivers and at the macro- and micro-scale. Only a scarce amount of individual efforts can be found from private sources. This paper presents a cursory view of the current plastic water waste catastrophe, associated robot research, and other efforts currently underway to address the issue. As well as the call that as a community, we must wait no longer to address the problem. Surely there is much potential for robots to help meet the challenges posed by the enormity of this problem.

##### Abstract (translated by Google)
塑料废物以指数速度填充我们的海洋。这种情况是灾难性的，现在已引起全世界的关注。尽管存在灾难性的情况，但在从海洋和河流以及宏观和微观尺度上识别，收集，分类和清除塑料废物方面，几乎没有机器人研究。私人来源只能找到少量的个人努力。本文简要介绍了目前塑料水废物灾难，相关机器人研究以及目前正在进行的解决该问题的其他努力。除了作为社区的呼吁，我们必须不再等待解决问题。当然，机器人有很大的潜力来帮助应对这个问题的巨大挑战。
