##### Abstract
The search for a point set configurations of the R^3 space which contains the smallest value of the Euclidean Steiner Ratio is almost finished. In the present work we introduce some analytical methods which aim to support a famous conjecture of Discrete Mathematics literature. The relations of this problem with that of molecular architecture in terms of motivation as well as application of the formulae obtained is also emphasized.
