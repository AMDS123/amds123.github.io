##### Abstract
LPMLN is a probabilistic extension of answer set programs with the weight scheme derived from that of Markov Logic. Previous work has shown how inference in LPMLN can be achieved. In this paper, we present the concept of weight learning in LPMLN and learning algorithms for LPMLN derived from those for Markov Logic. We also present a prototype implementation that uses answer set solvers for learning as well as some example domains that illustrate distinct features of LPMLN learning. Learning in LPMLN is in accordance with the stable model semantics, thereby it learns parameters for probabilistic extensions of knowledge-rich domains where answer set programming has shown to be useful but limited to the deterministic case, such as reachability analysis and reasoning about actions in dynamic domains. We also apply the method to learn the parameters for probabilistic abductive reasoning about actions.

LPMLN是答案集程序的概率扩展，其权重方案源自马尔可夫逻辑。以前的工作表明如何实现LPMLN的推理。在本文中，我们提出了LPMLN中的权重学习概念和来自马尔可夫逻辑的LPMLN的学习算法。我们还提供了一个原型实现，它使用答案集求解器进行学习，以及一些示例域，用于说明LPMLN学习的不同特征。在LPMLN中学习符合稳定模型语义，因此它学习知识丰富域的概率扩展的参数，其中答案集编程已经证明是有用的但仅限于确定性案例，例如可达性分析和关于动态行为的推理域。我们还应用该方法来学习关于动作的概率性诱导推理的参数。
