##### Abstract
A novel multi-atlas based image segmentation method is proposed by integrating a semi-supervised label propagation method and a supervised random forests method in a pattern recognition based label fusion framework. The semi-supervised label propagation method takes into consideration local and global image appearance of images to be segmented and segments the images by propagating reliable segmentation results obtained by the supervised random forests method. Particularly, the random forests method is used to train a regression model based on image patches of atlas images for each voxel of the images to be segmented. The regression model is used to obtain reliable segmentation results to guide the label propagation for the segmentation. The proposed method has been compared with state-of-the-art multi-atlas based image segmentation methods for segmenting the hippocampus in MR images. The experiment results have demonstrated that our method obtained superior segmentation performance.

##### Abstract (translated by Google)
基于模式识别的标签融合框架，将半监督标签传播方法和监督随机森林方法相结合，提出了一种基于多图谱的图像分割方法。半监督标签传播方法考虑到要分割的图像的局部和全局图像外观，并通过传播监督随机森林方法获得的可靠分割结果来分割图像。特别地，随机森林方法用于训练基于待分割图像的每个体素的图谱图像块的回归模型。回归模型用于获得可靠的分割结果来指导分割的标签传播。所提出的方法已经与用于在MR图像中分割海马的最先进的基于多图谱的图像分割方法进行比较。实验结果表明，该方法获得了较好的分割性能。
