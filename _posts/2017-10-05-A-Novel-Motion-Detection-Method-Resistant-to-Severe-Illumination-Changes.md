##### Abstract
Recently, there has been a considerable attention given to the motion detection problem due to the explosive growth of its applications in video analysis and surveillance systems. While the previous approaches can produce good results, an accurate detection of motion remains a challenging task due to the difficulties raised by illumination variations, occlusion, camouflage, burst physical motion, dynamic texture, and environmental changes such as those on climate changes, sunlight changes during a day, etc. In this paper, we propose a novel per-pixel motion descriptor for both motion detection and dynamic texture segmentation which outperforms the current methods in the literature particularly in severe scenarios. The proposed descriptor is based on two complementary three-dimensional-discrete wavelet transform (3D-DWT) and three-dimensional wavelet leader. In this approach, a feature vector is extracted for each pixel by applying a novel three dimensional wavelet-based motion descriptor. Then, the extracted features are clustered by a clustering method such as well-known k-means algorithm or Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM). The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method compared to the other motion detection approaches from the literature. The application of the proposed method and additional experimental results for the different datasets are available at (this http URL).

近年来，由于其在视频分析和监控系统中应用的爆炸式增长，人们对移动检测问题倍受关注。虽然以前的方法可以产生良好的结果，但是由于光照变化，遮挡，伪装，爆裂物理运动，动态纹理以及诸如气候变化，阳光变化等环境变化所引起的困难，精确的运动检测仍然是具有挑战性的任务一天等。本文中，我们提出了一种运动检测和动态纹理分割的新型的每像素运动描述符，在文献中特别是在严重的情况下，其性能优于目前的方法。所提出的描述符是基于两个互补的三维离散小波变换（3D-DWT）和三维小波领导。在这种方法中，通过应用新颖的基于三维小波的运动描述符为每个像素提取特征向量。然后，提取的特征通过诸如公知的k-均值算法或高斯混合模型（GMM）的聚类方法被聚类。实验结果证明了我们提出的方法与文献中的其他运动检测方法相比的有效性。所提出的方法的应用和针对不同数据集的额外的实验结果可以在（这个http URL）处获得。
