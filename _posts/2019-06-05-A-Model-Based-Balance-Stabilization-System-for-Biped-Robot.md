##### Abstract
This paper presents a model-based balance stabilization system which takes into account not only the stable part of COM dynamics but also the unstable part. In this system, the overall dynamics of a humanoid robot is approximated using a Linear Inverted Pendulum Plus Flywheel Model (LIPPFM). Moreover, Divergent Component of Motion~(DCM) is used to define when and where a robot should take a step to prevent falling. The proposed system has been successfully tested by performing several simulations using MATLAB. The simulation results show this system is capable of stabilizing the balance of the robot in various conditions.
