##### Abstract
The scripting language described in this document is (in the first place) intended to be used on robots developed by Anja M{\o}lle Lindelof and Henning Christiansen as part of a research project about robots performing on stage. The target robots are expected to appear as familiar domestic objects that take their own life, so to speak, and perhaps perform together with human players, creating at illusion of a communication between them. In the current version, these robots' common behaviour is determined uniquely by a script written in the language described here -- the only possible autonomy for the robots is action to correct dynamically for inaccuracies that arise during a performance. The present work is preliminary and has not been compared to properly to other research work in this area, and the testing is still limited. A first implementation on small Lego Mindstorms based robots is under development by Mads Saustrup Fox as part of his master thesis work.

本文档中描述的脚本语言（首先）旨在用于由Anja M Lindeloof和Henning Christiansen开发的机器人，作为有关在舞台上表演的机器人的研究项目的一部分。预期目标机器人将会以熟悉的家用物品的形式出现，也就是说，也许可以和人类玩家一起表演，在他们之间形成一种交流的幻觉。在当前的版本中，这些机器人的共同行为是由用这里描述的语言编写的脚本唯一地确定的 - 机器人的唯一可能的自主性是动态地校正在演奏期间出现的不准确性的动作。目前的工作尚处于初步阶段，尚未与该领域的其他研究工作进行比较，检测仍然有限。作为他的硕士论文工作的一部分，Mads Saustrup Fox正在开发小型乐高头脑风暴机器人的第一个实现。
