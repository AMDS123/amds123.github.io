##### Abstract
With the development of human communications the usage of Visual Communications has also increased. The advancement of image compression methods is one of the main reasons for the enhancement. This paper first presents main modes of image compression methods such as JPEG and JPEG2000 without mathematical details. Also, the paper describes gradient Haar wavelet transforms in order to construct a preliminary image compression algorithm. Then, a new image compression method is proposed based on the preliminary image compression algorithm that can improve standards of image compression. The new method is compared with original modes of JPEG and JPEG2000 (based on Haar wavelet) by image quality measures such as MAE, PSNAR, and SSIM. The image quality and statistical results confirm that can boost image compression standards. It is suggested that the new method is used in a part or all of an image compression standard.

随着人类交流的发展，可视通信的使用也有所增加。图像压缩方法的进步是增强的主要原因之一。本文首先介绍了JPEG和JPEG2000等图像压缩方法的主要模式，没有数学细节。此外，本文描述梯度哈尔小波变换，以构建一个初步的图像压缩算法。然后，提出了一种基于初步图像压缩算法的图像压缩方法，可以提高图像压缩标准。通过MAE，PSNAR和SSIM等图像质量测量方法，将新方法与JPEG和JPEG2000（基于Haar小波）的原始模式进行比较。图像质量和统计结果证实可以提高图像压缩标准。建议将新方法用于图像压缩标准的一部分或全部。
