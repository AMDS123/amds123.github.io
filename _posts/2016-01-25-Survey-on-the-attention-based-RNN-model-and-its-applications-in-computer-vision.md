##### Abstract
The recurrent neural networks (RNN) can be used to solve the sequence to sequence problem, where both the input and the output have sequential structures. Usually there are some implicit relations between the structures. However, it is hard for the common RNN model to fully explore the relations between the sequences. In this survey, we introduce some attention based RNN models which can focus on different parts of the input for each output item, in order to explore and take advantage of the implicit relations between the input and the output items. The different attention mechanisms are described in detail. We then introduce some applications in computer vision which apply the attention based RNN models. The superiority of the attention based RNN model is shown by the experimental results. At last some future research directions are given.

##### Abstract (translated by Google)
循环神经网络（RNN）可以用来解决序列问题，其中输入和输出都具有顺序结构。通常这些结构之间有一些隐含的关系。然而，普遍的RNN模型很难全面地探索序列之间的关系。在本次调查中，我们引入了一些基于注意力的RNN模型，它们可以针对每个输出项目的输入的不同部分进行关注，以便探索和利用输入和输出项目之间的隐含关系。详细描述了不同的关注机制。然后我们介绍一些在计算机视觉中应用基于注意力的RNN模型的应用。实验结果表明了基于注意的RNN模型的优越性。最后给出了未来的研究方向。
