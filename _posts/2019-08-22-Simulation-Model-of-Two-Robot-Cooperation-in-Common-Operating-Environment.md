##### Abstract
The article considers a simulation modelling problem related to the chess game process occurring between two three-tier manipulators. The objective of the game construction lies in developing the procedure of effective control of the autonomous manipulator robots located in a common operating environment. The simulation model is a preliminary stage of building a natural complex that would provide cooperation of several manipulator robots within a common operating environment. The article addresses issues of training and research.
