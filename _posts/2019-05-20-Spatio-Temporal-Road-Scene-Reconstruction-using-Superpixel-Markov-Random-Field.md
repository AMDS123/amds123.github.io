##### Abstract
Scene model construction based on image rendering is an indispensable but challenging technique in computer vision and intelligent transportation systems. In this paper, we propose a framework for constructing 3D corridor-based road scene models. This consists of two successive stages: road detection and scene construction. The road detection is realized by a new superpixel Markov random field (MRF) algorithm. The data fidelity term in the MRF's energy function is jointly computed according to the superpixel features of color, texture and location. The smoothness term is established on the basis of the interaction of spatio-temporally adjacent superpixels. In the subsequent scene construction, the foreground and background regions are modeled independently. Experiments for road detection demonstrate the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art in both accuracy and speed. The scene construction experiments confirm that the proposed scene models show better correctness ratios, and have the potential to support a range of applications.
