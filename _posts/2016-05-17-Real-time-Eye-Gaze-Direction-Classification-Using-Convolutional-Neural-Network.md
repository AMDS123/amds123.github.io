##### Abstract
Estimation eye gaze direction is useful in various human-computer interaction tasks. Knowledge of gaze direction can give valuable information regarding users point of attention. Certain patterns of eye movements known as eye accessing cues are reported to be related to the cognitive processes in the human brain. We propose a real-time framework for the classification of eye gaze direction and estimation of eye accessing cues. In the first stage, the algorithm detects faces using a modified version of the Viola-Jones algorithm. A rough eye region is obtained using geometric relations and facial landmarks. The eye region obtained is used in the subsequent stage to classify the eye gaze direction. A convolutional neural network is employed in this work for the classification of eye gaze direction. The proposed algorithm was tested on Eye Chimera database and found to outperform state of the art methods. The computational complexity of the algorithm is very less in the testing phase. The algorithm achieved an average frame rate of 24 fps in the desktop environment.

估计眼睛注视方向在各种人机交互任务中是有用的。注视方向的知识可以给用户提供有价值的信息。据报道，某些被称为眼睛接入线索的眼动模式与人脑中的认知过程有关。我们提出了一个实时的眼睛注视方向分类和眼睛访问线索的估计框架。在第一阶段，算法使用Viola-Jones算法的修改版本检测脸部。使用几何关系和面部标志来获得粗糙的眼睛区域。所获得的眼睛区域被用于后续阶段以分类眼睛注视方向。本文采用卷积神经网络对眼球注视方向进行分类。所提出的算法在Eye Chimera数据库上进行了测试，发现其性能优于现有技术。算法的计算复杂度在测试阶段是非常少的。该算法在桌面环境下实现了24 fps的平均帧速率。
