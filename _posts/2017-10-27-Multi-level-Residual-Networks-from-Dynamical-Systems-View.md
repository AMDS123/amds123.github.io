##### Abstract
Deep residual networks (ResNets) and their variants are widely used in many computer vision applications and natural language processing tasks. However, the theoretical principles for designing and training ResNets are still not fully understood. Recently, several points of view have emerged to try to interpret ResNet theoretically, such as unraveled view, unrolled iterative estimation and dynamical systems view. In this paper, we adopt the dynamical systems point of view, and analyze the lesioning properties of ResNet both theoretically and experimentally. Based on these analyses, we additionally propose a novel method for accelerating ResNet training. We apply the proposed method to train ResNets and Wide ResNets for three image classification benchmarks, reducing training time by more than 40\% with superior or on-par accuracy.

深度残差网络（ResNets）及其变体广泛用于许多计算机视觉应用和自然语言处理任务。然而，设计和培训ResNets的理论原则还没有完全理解。最近，出现了几个观点，试图从理论上解释ResNet，如展开视图，展开迭代估计和动态系统视图。在本文中，我们采用动力系统的观点，从理论和实验两方面分析ResNet的损伤特性。基于这些分析，我们还提出了一种加速ResNet训练的新方法。我们将所提出的方法应用于三种图像分类基准的Res​​Nets和Wide ResNets训练，减少了40％以上的训练时间，并具有优异或准确性。
