##### Abstract
Discriminating targets moving against a cluttered background is a huge challenge, let alone detecting a target as small as one or a few pixels and tracking it in flight. In the fly's visual system, a class of specific neurons, called small target motion detectors (STMDs), have been identified as showing exquisite selectivity for small target motion. Some of the STMDs have also demonstrated directional selectivity which means these STMDs respond strongly only to their preferred motion direction. Directional selectivity is an important property of these STMD neurons which could contribute to tracking small targets such as mates in flight. However, little has been done on systematically modeling these directional selective STMD neurons. In this paper, we propose a directional selective STMD-based neural network (DSTMD) for small target detection in a cluttered background. In the proposed neural network, a new correlation mechanism is introduced for direction selectivity via correlating signals relayed from two pixels. Then, a lateral inhibition mechanism is implemented on the spatial field for size selectivity of STMD neurons. Extensive experiments showed that the proposed neural network not only is in accord with current biological findings, i.e. showing directional preferences, but also worked reliably in detecting small targets against cluttered backgrounds.

识别在杂乱背景下移动的目标是一个巨大的挑战，更不用说检测小到一个或几个像素的目标并在飞行中跟踪它。在苍蝇的视觉系统中，一类特定的神经元，称为小目标运动探测器（STMD），已被确定为显示出对小目标运动的精确选择性。一些STMD也表现出方向选择性，这意味着这些STMD仅对其优选的运动方向作出强烈反应。定向选择性是这些STMD神经元的重要特性，其可以有助于跟踪诸如飞行中的配偶之类的小目标。然而，在对这些定向选择性STMD神经元进行系统建模方面几乎没有做过。在本文中，我们提出了一种基于方向选择性STMD的神经网络（DSTMD），用于在杂乱的背景中进行小目标检测。在所提出的神经网络中，通过关联从两个像素中继的信号，引入了用于方向选择性的新的相关机制。然后，在空间场上实现横向抑制机制，用于STMD神经元的大小选择性。大量实验表明，所提出的神经网络不仅符合当前的生物学发现，即显示方向偏好，而且在检测针对杂乱背景的小目标时也可靠地工作。
