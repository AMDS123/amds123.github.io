##### Abstract
The language used in online forums differs in many ways from that of traditional language resources such as news. One difference is the use and frequency of nonliteral, subjective dialogue acts such as sarcasm. Whether the aim is to develop a theory of sarcasm in dialogue, or engineer automatic methods for reliably detecting sarcasm, a major challenge is simply the difficulty of getting enough reliably labelled examples. In this paper we describe our work on methods for achieving highly reliable sarcasm annotations from untrained annotators on Mechanical Turk. We explore the use of a number of common statistical reliability measures, such as Kappa, Karger's, Majority Class, and EM. We show that more sophisticated measures do not appear to yield better results for our data than simple measures such as assuming that the correct label is the one that a majority of Turkers apply.

在线论坛中使用的语言在许多方面与传统语言资源（如新闻）有所不同。一个不同之处是非诽谤的主观对话行为，如讽刺的使用和频率。无论是为了在对话中发展一个讽刺理论，还是设计可靠地检测讽刺的自动方法，一个主要挑战就是获得足够可靠标记的例子的难度。在本文中，我们描述了在Mechanical Turk上从未经训练的注释者获得高度可靠的讽刺注释的方法。我们探索使用一些常用的统计可靠性度量，如Kappa，Karger's，多数类和EM。我们表明，更复杂的措施似乎没有产生比我们的数据更好的结果比简单的措施，如假设正确的标签是大多数的土耳其人适用的标签。
