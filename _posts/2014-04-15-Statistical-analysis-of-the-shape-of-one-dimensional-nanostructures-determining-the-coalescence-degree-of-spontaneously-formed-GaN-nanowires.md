##### Abstract
Single GaN nanowires formed spontaneously on a given substrate represent nanoscopic single crystals free of any extended defects. However, due to the high area density of thus formed GaN nanowire ensembles, individual nanowires coalesce with others in their immediate vicinity. This coalescence process may introduce strain and structural defects, foiling the idea of defect-free material due to the nanowire geometry. To investigate the consequences of this process, a quantitative measure of the coalescence of nanowire ensembles is required. We derive objective criteria to determine the coalescence degree of GaN nanowire ensembles. These criteria are based on the area-perimeter relationship of the cross-sectional shapes observed, and in particular on their circularity. Employing these criteria, we distinguish single nanowires from coalesced aggregates in an ensemble, determine the diameter distribution of both, and finally analyze the coalescence degree of nanowire ensembles with increasing fill factor.
