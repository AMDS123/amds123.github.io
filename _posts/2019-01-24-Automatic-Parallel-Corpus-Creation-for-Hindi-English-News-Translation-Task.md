##### Abstract
The parallel corpus for multilingual NLP tasks, deep learning applications like Statistical Machine Translation Systems is very important. The parallel corpus of Hindi-English language pair available for news translation task till date is of very limited size as per the requirement of the systems are concerned. In this work we have developed an automatic parallel corpus generation system prototype, which creates Hindi-English parallel corpus for news translation task. Further to verify the quality of generated parallel corpus we have experimented by taking various performance metrics and the results are quite interesting.
