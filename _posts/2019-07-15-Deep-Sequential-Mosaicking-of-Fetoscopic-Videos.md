##### Abstract
Twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome treatment requires fetoscopic laser photocoagulation of placental vascular anastomoses to regulate blood flow to both fetuses. Limited field-of-view (FoV) and low visual quality during fetoscopy make it challenging to identify all vascular connections. Mosaicking can align multiple overlapping images to generate an image with increased FoV, however, existing techniques apply poorly to fetoscopy due to the low visual quality, texture paucity, and hence fail in longer sequences due to the drift accumulated over time. Deep learning techniques can facilitate in overcoming these challenges. Therefore, we present a new generalized Deep Sequential Mosaicking (DSM) framework for fetoscopic videos captured from different settings such as simulation, phantom, and real environments. DSM extends an existing deep image-based homography model to sequential data by proposing controlled data augmentation and outlier rejection methods. Unlike existing methods, DSM can handle visual variations due to specular highlights and reflection across adjacent frames, hence reducing the accumulated drift. We perform experimental validation and comparison using 5 diverse fetoscopic videos to demonstrate the robustness of our framework.
