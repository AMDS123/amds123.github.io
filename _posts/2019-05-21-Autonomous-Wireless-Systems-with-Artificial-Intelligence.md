##### Abstract
This paper discusses technology and opportunities to embrace artificial intelligence (AI) in the design of autonomous wireless systems. We aim to provide readers with motivation and general AI methodology of autonomous agents in the context of self-organization in real time by unifying knowledge management with sensing, reasoning and active learning. We highlight differences between training-based methods for matching problems and training-free methods for environment-specific problems. Finally, we conceptually introduce the functions of an autonomous agent with knowledge management.
