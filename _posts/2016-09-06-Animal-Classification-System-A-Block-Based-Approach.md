##### Abstract
In this work, we propose a method for the classification of animal in images. Initially, a graph cut based method is used to perform segmentation in order to eliminate the background from the given image. The segmented animal images are partitioned in to number of blocks and then the color texture moments are extracted from different blocks. Probabilistic neural network and K-nearest neighbors are considered here for classification. To corroborate the efficacy of the proposed method, an experiment was conducted on our own data set of 25 classes of animals, which consisted of 4000 sample images. The experiment was conducted by picking images randomly from the database to study the effect of classification accuracy, and the results show that the K-nearest neighbors classifier achieves good performance.

在这项工作中，我们提出了一种在图像中对动物进行分类的方法。最初，使用基于图切的方法来执行分割以消除来自给定图像的背景。将分割的动物图像分割成多个块，然后从不同的块提取颜色纹理矩。这里考虑概率神经网络和K近邻。为了证实所提出的方法的有效性，对我们自己的由25个类别的动物组成的数据集进行了实验，其中包括4000个样本图像。通过从数据库中随机选取图像进行实验，研究分类精度的影响，结果表明K-近邻分类器性能良好。
