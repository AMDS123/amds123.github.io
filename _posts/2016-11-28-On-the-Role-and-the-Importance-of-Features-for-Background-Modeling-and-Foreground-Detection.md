##### Abstract
Background modeling has emerged as a popular foreground detection technique for various applications in video surveillance. Background modeling methods have become increasing efficient in robustly modeling the background and hence detecting moving objects in any visual scene. Although several background subtraction and foreground detection have been proposed recently, no traditional algorithm today still seem to be able to simultaneously address all the key challenges of illumination variation, dynamic camera motion, cluttered background and occlusion. This limitation can be attributed to the lack of systematic investigation concerning the role and importance of features within background modeling and foreground detection. With the availability of a rather large set of invariant features, the challenge is in determining the best combination of features that would improve accuracy and robustness in detection. The purpose of this study is to initiate a rigorous and comprehensive survey of features used within background modeling and foreground detection. Further, this paper presents a systematic experimental and statistical analysis of techniques that provide valuable insight on the trends in background modeling and use it to draw meaningful recommendations for practitioners. In this paper, a preliminary review of the key characteristics of features based on the types and sizes is provided in addition to investigating their intrinsic spectral, spatial and temporal properties. Furthermore, improvements using statistical and fuzzy tools are examined and techniques based on multiple features are benchmarked against reliability and selection criterion. Finally, a description of the different resources available such as datasets and codes is provided.

背景建模已经成为视频监控中各种应用的流行前景检测技术。背景建模方法在对背景进行鲁棒建模方面已经变得越来越高效，并因此在任何视觉场景中检测运动对象。尽管近来已经提出了几种背景减除和前景检测，但是目前的传统算法似乎仍然不能同时解决照明变化，动态相机运动，杂乱背景和遮挡的所有关键挑战。这种局限性可归因于对背景建模和前景检测中的特征的作用和重要性缺乏系统的调查。随着一系列相当大的不变特征的可用性，挑战在于确定能够提高检测的准确性和鲁棒性的特征的最佳组合。本研究的目的是对背景建模和前景检测中使用的特征进行严格而全面的调查。此外，本文提供了系统的实验和统计分析的技术，提供有价值的背景建模趋势的见解，并用它来为从业人员提供有意义的建议。在本文中，除了研究其内在的光谱，空间和时间特性外，还对基于类型和大小的特征的关键特征进行了初步的回顾。此外，使用统计和模糊工具的改进进行了检查，基于多个特征的技术是基于可靠性和选择标准的基准。最后，提供了对数据集和代码等不同资源的描述。
