##### Abstract
Camera traps are a valuable tool for studying biodiversity, but research using this data is limited by the speed of human annotation. With the vast amounts of data now available it is imperative that we develop automatic solutions for annotating camera trap data in order to allow this research to scale. A promising approach is based on deep networks trained on human-annotated images. We provide a challenge dataset to explore whether such solutions generalize to novel locations, since systems that are trained once and may be deployed to operate automatically in new locations would be most useful.
