##### Abstract
In meetings where important decisions get made, what items receive more attention may influence the outcome. We examine how different types of rhetorical (de-)emphasis -- including hedges, superlatives, and contrastive conjunctions -- correlate with what gets revisited later, controlling for item frequency and speaker. Our data consists of transcripts of recurring meetings of the Federal Reserve's Open Market Committee (FOMC), where important aspects of U.S. monetary policy are decided on. Surprisingly, we find that words appearing in the context of hedging, which is usually considered a way to express uncertainty, are more likely to be repeated in subsequent meetings, while strong emphasis indicated by superlatives has a slightly negative effect on word recurrence in subsequent meetings. We also observe interesting patterns in how these effects vary depending on social factors such as status and gender of the speaker. For instance, the positive effects of hedging are more pronounced for female speakers than for male speakers.

在做出重要决定的会议上，哪些项目受到更多关注可能会影响结果。我们研究了不同类型的修辞（去）重点 - 包括对冲，最高级和对比连词 - 与以后重新审视的内容相关，控制项目频率和说话人。我们的数据包括美联储公开市场委员会（FOMC）经常性会议记录，这些会议决定了美国货币政策的重要方面。令人惊讶的是，我们发现在对冲的背景下出现的通常被认为是表达不确定性的方式在随后的会议中更有可能重复出现，而最高级别的强调则在随后的会议中对单词重现产生轻微的负面影响。我们还观察到这些效果如何随着说话者的地位和性别等社会因素而变化的有趣模式。例如，对于女性说话者而言，套期保值的积极作用比男性说话者更为明显。
