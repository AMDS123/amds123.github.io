##### Abstract
Results of the application of pattern recognition techniques to the problem of identifying Giant Radio Sources (GRS) from the data in the NVSS catalog are presented and issues affecting the process are explored. Decision-tree pattern recognition software was applied to training set source pairs developed from known NVSS large angular size radio galaxies. The full training set consisted of 51,195 source pairs, 48 of which were known GRS for which each lobe was primarily represented by a single catalog component. The source pairs had a maximum separation of 20 arc minutes and a minimum component area of 1.87 square arc minutes at the 1.4 mJy level. The importance of comparing resulting probability distributions of the training and application sets for cases of unknown class ratio is demonstrated. The probability of correctly ranking a randomly selected (GRS, non-GRS) pair from the best of the tested classifiers was determined to be 97.8 +/- 1.5%. The best classifiers were applied to the over 870,000 candidate pairs from the entire catalog. Images of higher ranked sources were visually screened and a table of over sixteen hundred candidates, including morphological annotation, is presented. These systems include doubles and triples, Wide-Angle Tail (WAT) and Narrow-Angle Tail (NAT), S- or Z-shaped systems, and core-jets and resolved cores. While some resolved lobe systems are recovered with this technique, generally it is expected that such systems would require a different approach.

介绍了模式识别技术在NVSS目录数据识别巨无线电源（GRS）问题中的应用结果，探讨了影响该过程的问题。将决策树模式识别软件应用于由已知NVSS大角度射电星系开发的训练集源对。完整的训练集包括51,195个源对，其中48个是已知的GRS，其中每个叶主要由单个目录组成部分表示。源对的最大间隔为20弧分，最小组分面积为1.4 mJy水平的1.87弧分。证明了比较未知类别比例情况下训练集和应用集的概率分布的重要性。从最好的测试分类器中随机选择（GRS，非GRS）对的概率被确定为97.8 +/- 1.5％。最好的分类器被应用于来自整个目录的超过870,000个候选对。视觉上筛选排名较高的来源的图像，并提供包括形态学注释在内的超过一千六百名候选人的表格。这些系统包括双倍和三倍，广角尾（WAT）和窄角尾（NAT），S形或Z形系统，核心射流和解决的核心。虽然用这种技术可以回收一些分解的叶系统，但是通常希望这样的系统需要不同的方法。
