##### Abstract
Binary features have been incrementally popular in the past few years due to their low memory footprints and the efficient computation of Hamming distance between binary descriptors. They have been shown with promising results on some real time applications, e.g., SLAM, where the matching operations are relative few. However, in computer vision, there are many applications such as 3D reconstruction requiring lots of matching operations between local features. Therefore, a natural question is that is the binary feature still a promising solution to this kind of applications? To get the answer, this paper conducts a comparative study of binary features and their matching methods on the context of 3D reconstruction in a recently proposed large scale mutliview stereo dataset. Our evaluations reveal that not all binary features are capable of this task. Most of them are inferior to the classical SIFT based method in terms of reconstruction accuracy and completeness with a not significant better computational performance.

由于二进制描述符之间的低内存占用和有效计算汉明距离，二进制特征在过去几年逐渐流行。在一些实时应用（例如，SLAM）中，它们已经显示出有希望的结果，其中匹配操作相对较少。然而，在计算机视觉领域，3D重建等诸多应用需要大量的局部特征匹配操作。因此，一个自然的问题是，二进制特性仍然是这种应用的有前途的解决方案？为了得到答案，本文在最近提出的大规模多点立体数据集的三维重建背景下，对二进制特征及其匹配方法进行了比较研究。我们的评估显示，并非所有的二进制功能都能完成这项任务。在重建准确性和完整性方面，它们大多不如经典的基于SIFT的方法，其计算性能并不显着。
