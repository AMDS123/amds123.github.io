##### Abstract
Despite the great advances made in the field of image super-resolution (ISR) during the last years, the performance has merely been evaluated perceptually. Thus, it is still unclear whether ISR is helpful for other vision tasks. In this paper, we present the first comprehensive study and analysis of the usefulness of ISR for other vision applications. In particular, six ISR methods are evaluated on four popular vision tasks, namely edge detection, semantic image segmentation, digit recognition, and scene recognition. We show that applying ISR to input images of other vision systems does improve their performance when the input images are of low-resolution. We also study the correlation between four standard perceptual evaluation criteria (namely PSNR, SSIM, IFC, and NQM) and the usefulness of ISR to the vision tasks. Experiments show that they correlate well with each other in general, but perceptual criteria are still not accurate enough to be used as full proxies for the usefulness. We hope this work will inspire the community to evaluate ISR methods also in real vision applications, and to adopt ISR as a pre-processing step of other vision tasks if the resolution of their input images is low.

尽管近年来在图像超分辨率（ISR）领域取得了巨大的进步，但其性能仅仅是通过感性评估。因此，ISR是否有助于其他视觉工作尚不清楚。在本文中，我们首先综合研究和分析ISR对其他视觉应用的有用性。特别是对四种常见的视觉任务，即边缘检测，语义图像分割，数字识别和场景识别评估了六种ISR方法。我们表明，应用ISR输入其他视觉系统的图像确实提高了输入图像的低分辨率时的性能。我们还研究了四种标准感知评估标准（即PSNR，SSIM，IFC和NQM）与ISR对视觉任务的有用性之间的相关性。实验表明，它们之间的相关性一般，但是感知标准仍然不够准确，不足以作为完整代理的用处。我们希望这项工作能激发社区在实际视觉应用中评估ISR方法，并且如果其输入图像的分辨率低，则将ISR作为其他视觉任务的预处理步骤。
