##### Abstract
This invited paper discusses a new but important problem, supervised autonomy, in the context of robotics. The paper defines supervised autonomy and compares the supervised autonomy with robotic teleoperation and robotic full autonomy. Based on the discussion, the significance of supervised autonomy was introduced. The paper discusses the challenging and unsolved problems in supervised autonomy, and reviews the related works in our research lab. Based on the discussions, the paper draws the conclusion that supervised autonomy is critical for applying robotic systems to address complicated problems in the real world.
