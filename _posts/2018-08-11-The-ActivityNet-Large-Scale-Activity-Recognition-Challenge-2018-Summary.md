##### Abstract
The 3rd annual installment of the ActivityNet Large- Scale Activity Recognition Challenge, held as a full-day workshop in CVPR 2018, focused on the recognition of daily life, high-level, goal-oriented activities from user-generated videos as those found in internet video portals. The 2018 challenge hosted six diverse tasks which aimed to push the limits of semantic visual understanding of videos as well as bridge visual content with human captions. Three out of the six tasks were based on the ActivityNet dataset, which was introduced in CVPR 2015 and organized hierarchically in a semantic taxonomy. These tasks focused on tracing evidence of activities in time in the form of proposals, class labels, and captions. In this installment of the challenge, we hosted three guest tasks to enrich the understanding of visual information in videos. The guest tasks focused on complementary aspects of the activity recognition problem at large scale and involved three challenging and recently compiled datasets: the Kinetics-600 dataset from Google DeepMind, the AVA dataset from Berkeley and Google, and the Moments in Time dataset from MIT and IBM Research.

ActivityNet大型活动识别挑战赛的第三届年度分期会，作为2018年CVPR的全天研讨会举行，重点是从用户生成的视频中识别日常生活，高水平，目标导向的活动。互联网视频门户网站。 2018年的挑战主持了六项不同的任务，旨在突破视频语义视觉理解的极限，并将人物标题与视觉内容联系起来。六个任务中有三个基于ActivityNet数据集，该数据集在CVPR 2015中引入，并在语义分类中按层次结构组织。这些任务的重点是以提案，类别标签和字幕的形式及时跟踪活动的证据。在本期挑战中，我们主持了三项客户任务，以丰富对视频中视觉信息的理解。客户任务主要集中在大规模活动识别问题的互补方面，涉及三个具有挑战性和最近编译的数据集：来自Google DeepMind的Kinetics-600数据集，来自Berkeley和Google的AVA数据集，以及来自麻省理工学院的时间数据集和IBM研究院。
