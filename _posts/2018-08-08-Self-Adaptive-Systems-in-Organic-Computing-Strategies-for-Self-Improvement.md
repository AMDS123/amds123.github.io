##### Abstract
With the intensified use of intelligent things, the demands on the technological systems are increasing permanently. A possible approach to meet the continuously changing challenges is to shift the system integration from design to run-time by using adaptive systems. Diverse adaptivity properties, so-called self-* properties, form the basis of these systems and one of the properties is self-improvement. It describes the ability of a system not only to adapt to a changing environment according to a predefined model, but also the capability to adapt the adaptation logic of the whole system. In this paper, a closer look is taken at the structure of self-adaptive systems. Additionally, the systems' ability to improve themselves during run-time is described from the perspective of Organic Computing. Furthermore, four different strategies for self-improvement are presented, following the taxonomy of self-adaptation suggested by Christian Krupitzer et al.

随着智能物品的使用越来越多，对技术系统的需求也在不断增加。应对不断变化的挑战的一种可能方法是通过使用自适应系统将系统集成从设计转移到运行时。不同的适应性特性，即所谓的自我特性，构成了这些系统的基础，其中一个特性是自我改进。它描述了系统不仅能够根据预定义的模型适应不断变化的环境，而且能够适应整个系统的适应逻辑。在本文中，我们仔细研究了自适应系统的结构。此外，从有机计算的角度描述了系统在运行期间自我改进的能力。此外，根据Christian Krupitzer等人提出的自适应分类法，提出了四种不同的自我改进策略。
