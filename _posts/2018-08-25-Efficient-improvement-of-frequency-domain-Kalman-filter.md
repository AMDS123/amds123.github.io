##### Abstract
The frequency-domain Kalman filter (FKF) has been utilized in many audio signal processing applications due to its fast convergence speed and robustness. However, the performance of the FKF in under-modeling situations has not been investigated. This paper presents an analysis of the steady-state behavior of the commonly used diagonalized FKF and reveals that it suffers from a biased solution in under-modeling scenarios. Two efficient improvements of the FKF are proposed, both having the benefits of the guaranteed optimal steady-state behavior at the cost of a very limited increase of the computational burden. The convergence behavior of the proposed algorithms is also compared analytically. Computer simulations are conducted to validate the improved performance of the proposed methods.

频域卡尔曼滤波器（FKF）由于其快速的收敛速度和鲁棒性而被用于许多音频信号处理应用中。然而，尚未研究FKF在欠模拟情况下的性能。本文提出了对常用对角化FKF的稳态行为的分析，并揭示了它在欠模型场景中存在偏向的解决方案。提出了FKF的两个有效改进，两者都具有保证的最佳稳态行为的益处，代价是计算负担的非常有限的增加。还分析了所提算法的收敛行为。进行计算机模拟以验证所提出方法的改进性能。
