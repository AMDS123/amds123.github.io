##### Abstract
This paper present a novel design of a crawler robot which is capable of transforming its chassis from an Omni crawler mode to a large sized wheel mode using a novel mechanism. The transformation occurs without any additional actuators. Interestingly the robot can transform into a large diameter and small width wheel which enhances its maneuverability like small turning radius and fast/efficient locomotion. This paper contributes on improving the locomotion mode of previously developed hybrid compliant omnicrawler robot CObRaSO. In addition to legged and tracked mechanism CObRaSO can now display large wheel mode which contributes to its locomotion capabilities. Mechanical design of the robot has been explained in a detailed manner in this paper and also the transforming experiment and torque analysis has been shown clearly

##### Abstract (translated by Google)
本文提出了一种新型履带式机器人设计，该设计能够使用新机制将其底盘从全方位履带式模式转变为大型轮式模式。转换不需要任何额外的执行器。有趣的是，机器人可以转化为大直径和小宽度的轮子，从而增强其机动性，如小转弯半径和快速/高效的运动。本文有助于改进先前开发的混合动力兼容式万能履带式机器人CObRaSO的运动模式。除了有腿和追踪机制外，CObRaSO现在还可以显示有助于其运动能力的大轮模式。本文详细阐述了机器人的机械设计，并对转换实验和转矩分析进行了清晰的表达
