##### Abstract
We present the first fully convolutional end-to-end solution for instance-aware semantic segmentation task. It inherits all the merits of FCNs for semantic segmentation and instance mask proposal. It performs instance mask prediction and classification jointly. The underlying convolutional representation is fully shared between the two sub-tasks, as well as between all regions of interest. The proposed network is highly integrated and achieves state-of-the-art performance in both accuracy and efficiency. It wins the COCO 2016 segmentation competition by a large margin. Code would be released at \url{this https URL}.

我们为实例感知语义分割任务提出了第一个完全卷积端到端解决方案。它继承了FCNs用于语义分割和实例掩码提议的所有优点。它共同执行实例掩码预测和分类。潜在的卷积表示在两个子任务之间以及在所有感兴趣的区域之间完全共享。所提出的网络高度集成，在准确性和效率方面实现了最先进的性能。它在很大程度上赢得了COCO 2016细分市场的竞争。代码将在\ url {this https URL}上发布。
