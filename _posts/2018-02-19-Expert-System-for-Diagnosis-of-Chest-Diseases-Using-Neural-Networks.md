##### Abstract
This article represents one of the contemporary trends in the application of the latest methods of information and communication technology for medicine through an expert system helps the doctor to diagnose some chest diseases which is important because of the frequent spread of chest diseases nowadays in addition to the overlap symptoms of these diseases, which is difficult to right diagnose by doctors with several algorithms: Forward Chaining, Backward Chaining, Neural Network(Back Propagation). However, this system cannot replace the doctor function, but it can help the doctor to avoid wrong diagnosis and treatments. It can also be developed in such a way to help the novice doctors.

##### Abstract (translated by Google)
本文介绍了通过专家系统应用最新的医学信息和通信技术的当代趋势之一，它有助于医生诊断一些胸部疾病，这些胸部疾病由于当今胸部疾病频繁传播这些疾病的重叠症状很难由医生用几种算法正确诊断：前向链，后向链，神经网络（后向传播）。但是，这个系统不能取代医生的功能，但它可以帮助医生避免错误的诊断和治疗。它也可以用这种方式来开发，以帮助新手医生。
