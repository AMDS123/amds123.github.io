##### Abstract
The 2010 Silent Speech Challenge benchmark is updated with new results obtained in a Deep Learning strategy, using the same input features and decoding strategy as in the original article. A Word Error Rate of 6.4% is obtained, compared to the published value of 17.4%. Additional results comparing new auto-encoder-based features with the original features at reduced dimensionality, as well as decoding scenarios on two different language models, are also presented. The Silent Speech Challenge archive has been updated to contain both the original and the new auto-encoder features, in addition to the original raw data.

“2010沉默的言语挑战”基准更新了深度学习策略中获得的新结果，使用与原始文章中相同的输入特性和解码策略。单词错误率为6.4％，与公布的17.4％相比较。还介绍了将新的基于自动编码器的特征与原始特征以较低的维度进行比较的另外的结果以及两种不同语言模型的解码场景。无声语音挑战存档已被更新，以包含原始和新的自动编码器功能，除了原始的原始数据。
