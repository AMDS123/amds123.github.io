##### Abstract
The fundamental role of hypernymy in NLP has motivated the development of many methods for the automatic identification of this relation, most of which rely on word distribution. We investigate an extensive number of such unsupervised measures, using several distributional semantic models that differ by context type and feature weighting. We analyze the performance of the different methods based on their linguistic motivation. Comparison to the state-of-the-art supervised methods shows that while supervised methods generally outperform the unsupervised ones, the former are sensitive to the distribution of training instances, hurting their reliability. Being based on general linguistic hypotheses and independent from training data, unsupervised measures are more robust, and therefore are still useful artillery for hypernymy detection.

##### Abstract (translated by Google)
上下文在NLP中的基本作用促使了这种关系的自动识别方法的发展，其中大部分依赖于词的分布。我们调查了大量的这种无监督的措施，使用不同的上下文类型和特征加权不同的分布式语义模型。我们根据他们的语言动机来分析不同方法的表现。与最先进的监督方法相比，监督方法通常优于无监督方法，前者对训练实例的分布敏感，损害其可靠性。基于一般的语言假设和独立于训练数据，无监督的措施更加强大，因此对于超监督检测仍然是有用的炮兵。
