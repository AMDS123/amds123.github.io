##### Abstract
Motion ability is one of the most important human properties, including gait as a basis of human transitional movement. Gait, as a biometric for recognizing human identities, can be non-intrusively captured signals using wearable or portable smart devices. In this study gait patterns is collected using a wireless platform of two sensors located at chest and right ankle of the subjects. Then the raw data has undergone some preprocessing methods and segmented into 5 seconds windows. Some time and frequency domain features is extracted and the performance evaluated by 5 different classifiers. Decision Tree (with all features) and K-Nearest Neighbors (with 10 selected features) classifiers reached 99.4% and 100% respectively.

运动能力是人类最重要的特性之一，包括步态作为人类过渡运动的基础。作为识别人类身份的生物特征，步态可以是使用可穿戴或便携式智能设备的非侵入性捕获信号。在这项研究中，步态模式采用位于胸部和右脚踝部的两个传感器的无线平台进行采集。然后原始数据经过一些预处理方法，并分割成5秒的窗口。一些时域和频域特征被提取并且由5个不同的分类器评估性能。决策树（具有全部特征）和K-最近邻（具有10个选择的特征）分类器分别达到99.4％和100％。
