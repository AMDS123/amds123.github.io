##### Abstract
We propose a novel biophysical and dichromatic reflectance model that efficiently characterises spectral skin reflectance. We show how to fit the model to multispectral face images enabling high quality estimation of diffuse and specular shading as well as biophysical parameter maps (melanin and haemoglobin). Our method works from a single image without requiring complex controlled lighting setups yet provides quantitatively accurate reconstructions and qualitatively convincing decomposition and editing.
