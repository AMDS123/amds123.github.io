##### Abstract
This paper proposes a new approach to representation learning based on geometric properties of the space of value functions. We study a two-part approximation of the value function: a nonlinear map from states to vectors, or representation, followed by a linear map from vectors to values. Our formulation considers adapting the representation to minimize the (linear) approximation of the value function of all stationary policies for a given environment. We show that this optimization reduces to making accurate predictions regarding a special class of value functions which we call adversarial value functions (AVFs). We argue that these AVFs make excellent auxiliary tasks, and use them to construct a loss which can be efficiently minimized to find a near-optimal representation for reinforcement learning. We highlight characteristics of the method in a series of experiments on the four-room domain.
