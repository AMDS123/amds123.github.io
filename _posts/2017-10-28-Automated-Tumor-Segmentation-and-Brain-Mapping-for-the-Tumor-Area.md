##### Abstract
Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is an important diagnostic tool for precise detection of various pathologies. Magnetic Resonance (MR) is more preferred than Computed Tomography (CT) due to the high resolution in MR images which help in better detection of neurological conditions. Graphical user interface (GUI) aided disease detection has become increasingly useful due to the increasing workload of doctors. In this proposed work, a novel two steps GUI technique for brain tumor segmentation as well as Brodmann area detec-tion of the segmented tumor is proposed. A data set of T2 weighted images of 15 patients is used for validating the proposed method. The patient data incor-porates variations in ethnicities, gender (male and female) and age (25-50), thus enhancing the authenticity of the proposed method. The tumors were segmented using Fuzzy C Means Clustering and Brodmann area detection was done using a known template, mapping each area to the segmented tumor image. The proposed method was found to be fairly accurate and robust in detecting tumor.

磁共振成像（MRI）是精确检测各种病变的重要诊断工具。磁共振（MR）比计算机断层扫描（CT）更优选，这是由于MR图像中的高分辨率有助于更好地检测神经病症。由于医生的工作量增加，图形用户界面（GUI）辅助疾病检测变得越来越有用。在这项提议的工作中，提出了一种新的两步GUI技术，用于脑肿瘤分割以及Brodmann区域分割肿瘤的检测。使用15名患者的T2加权图像的数据集来验证所提出的方法。患者数据包含种族，性别（男性和女性）和年龄（25-50岁）的变化，从而增强了所提出的方法的真实性。使用模糊C均值聚类对肿瘤进行分割，并使用已知模板进行Brodmann区域检测，将每个区域映射到分割的肿瘤图像。所提出的方法被发现在检测肿瘤方面相当准确和强大。
