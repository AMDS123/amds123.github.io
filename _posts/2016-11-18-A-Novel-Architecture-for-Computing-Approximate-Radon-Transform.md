##### Abstract
Radon transform is a type of transform which is used in image processing to transfer the image into intercept-slope coordinate. Its diagonal properties made it appropriate for some applications which need processes in different degrees. Radon transform computation needs a lot of arithmetic operations which makes it a compute-intensive algorithm. In literature an approximate algorithm for computing Radon transform is introduces which reduces the complexity of computations. But this algorithm is complex and need arbitrary accesses to memory. In this paper we proposed an algorithm which accesses to memory sequentially. In the following an architecture is introduced which uses pipeline to reduce the time complexity of algorithm.

Radon变换是一种用于图像处理的变换，将图像转换为截距坐标。其对角线特性使其适用于某些需要不同程度处理的应用。 Radon变换计算需要大量的算术运算，使其成为一个计算密集型算法。文献中介绍了一种计算Radon变换的近似算法，降低了计算的复杂度。但是这个算法是复杂的，需要任意访问内存。在本文中，我们提出了一种按顺序访问存储器的算法。下面介绍一种利用流水线来降低算法时间复杂度的架构。
