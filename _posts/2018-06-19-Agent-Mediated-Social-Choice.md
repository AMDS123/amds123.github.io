##### Abstract
Computational studies of voting are mostly motivated by two intended applications: the coordination of societies of artificial agents, and the study of human collective decisions whose complexity requires the use of computational techniques. Both research directions are too often confined to theoretical studies, with unrealistic assumptions constraining their significance for real-world situations. Most practical applications of these results are therefore confined to low-stakes decisions, which are of great importance in expanding the use of algorithms in society, but are far from high-stakes choices such as political elections, referenda, or parliamentary decisions, which societies still make using old-fashioned technologies like paper ballots. In this paper I argue in favour of conceiving "voting avatars", artificial agents that are able to act as proxies for voters in collective decisions at any level of society. Besides being an ideal test-bed for a large number of techniques developed in the field of multiagent systems and artificial intelligence in general, agent-mediated social choice may also suggests innovative solutions to the low voter participation that is endemic in most practical implementations of electronic decision processes.

对投票的计算研究主要受两个预期应用的驱动：协调人工代理社团和研究人的集体决策，其复杂性要求使用计算技术。这两个研究方向往往局限于理论研究，不切实际的假设限制了其对现实世界情况的重要性。因此，这些结果的大多数实际应用都局限于低风险的决策，这对于扩大社会中算法的使用非常重要，但远没有高风险的选择，如政治选举，全民投票或议会决策，这些社会仍然使用纸质投票等老式技术。在本文中，我认为赞成构思“投票头像”，这种人工代理能够在任何社会阶层的集体决策中作为选民的代理人。除了作为多学科系统和人工智能领域开发的大量技术的理想测试平台之外，以代理人为中介的社会选择还可能为低选民参与提供创新解决方案，这在大多数电子实践中是流行的决策过程。
