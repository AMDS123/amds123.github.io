##### Abstract
In this article, we describe the design and implementation of a publicly accessible dermatology image analysis benchmark challenge. The goal of the challenge is to sup- port research and development of algorithms for automated diagnosis of melanoma, a lethal form of skin cancer, from dermoscopic images. The challenge was divided into sub-challenges for each task involved in image analysis, including lesion segmentation, dermoscopic feature detection within a lesion, and classification of melanoma. Training data included 900 images. A separate test dataset of 379 images was provided to measure resultant performance of systems developed with the training data. Ground truth for both training and test sets was generated by a panel of dermoscopic experts. In total, there were 79 submissions from a group of 38 participants, making this the largest standardized and comparative study for melanoma diagnosis in dermoscopic images to date. While the official challenge duration and ranking of participants has concluded, the datasets remain available for further research and development.

在本文中，我们描述了一个可公开访问的皮肤病图像分析基准测试挑战的设计和实施。挑战的目标是支持皮肤镜像自动诊断黑色素瘤（一种致命形式的皮肤癌）的算法研究和开发。挑战分为涉及图像分析的每个任务的子挑战，包括病灶分割，病灶内的皮肤镜特征检测以及黑素瘤的分类。训练数据包括900个图像。提供了379个图像的单独测试数据集，以测量使用训练数据开发的系统的最终性能。皮肤镜专家小组产生了训练和测试集的基础事实。总共有38位参与者提交了79份意见书，这是迄今为止皮肤镜图像中诊断黑色素瘤最大的标准化和比较性研究。在参与者的正式挑战持续时间和排名结束时，数据集仍可供进一步研究和开发。
