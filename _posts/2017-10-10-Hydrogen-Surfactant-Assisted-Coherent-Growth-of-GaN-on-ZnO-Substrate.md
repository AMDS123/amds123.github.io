##### Abstract
Heterostructures of wurtzite based devices have attracted great research interests since the tremendous success of GaN in light emitting diodes (LED) industry. Among the possible heterostructure material candidates, high quality GaN thin films on inexpensive and lattice matched ZnO substrate are both commercially and technologically desirable. However, the energy of ZnO polar surfaces is much lower than that of GaN polar surfaces. Therefore, the intrinsic wetting condition forbids such heterostructures. As a result, poor crystal quality and 3D growth mode were obtained. To dramatically change the growth mode of the heterostructure, we propose to use hydrogen as a surfactant, confirmed by our first principles calculations. Stable H involved surface configurations and interfaces are investigated, with the help of newly developed algorithms. By applying the experimental Gibbs free energy of H$_2$, we also predict the temperature and chemical potential of H, which is critical in experimental realizations of our strategy. This novel approach will for the first time make the growth of high quality GaN thin films on ZnO substrates possible. We believe that our new strategy may reduce the manufactory cost and improve the crystal quality and the efficiency of GaN based devices.

由于氮化镓在发光二极管（LED）行业的巨大成功，纤锌矿型器件的异质结构吸引了很多研究兴趣。在可能的异质结构材料候选中，在便宜和晶格匹配的ZnO衬底上的高质量GaN薄膜在商业和技术上都是合乎需要的。然而，ZnO极性表面的能量远低于GaN极性表面的能量。因此，固有的润湿条件禁止这种异质结构。结果，获得了差的晶体质量和3D生长模式。为了大幅度地改变异质结构的生长模式，我们建议使用氢作为表面活性剂，通过我们的第一原理计算来证实。在新开发的算法的帮助下，研究稳定的H表面配置和界面。通过应用实验Gibbs自由能H $ _2 $，我们还预测了H的温度和化学势，这对于我们的策略的实验实现是至关重要的。这种新颖的方法将首次使在ZnO衬底上生长高质量的GaN薄膜成为可能。我们相信，我们的新策略可能会降低制造成本，提高氮化镓基器件的晶体质量和效率。
