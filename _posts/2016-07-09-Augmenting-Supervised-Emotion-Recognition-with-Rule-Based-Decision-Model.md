##### Abstract
The aim of this research is development of rule based decision model for emotion recognition. This research also proposes using the rules for augmenting inter-corporal recognition accuracy in multimodal systems that use supervised learning techniques. The classifiers for such learning based recognition systems are susceptible to over fitting and only perform well on intra-corporal data. To overcome the limitation this research proposes using rule based model as an additional modality. The rules were developed using raw feature data from visual channel, based on human annotator agreement and existing studies that have attributed movement and postures to emotions. The outcome of the rule evaluations was combined during the decision phase of emotion recognition system. The results indicate rule based emotion recognition augment recognition accuracy of learning based systems and also provide better recognition rate across inter corpus emotion test data.

本研究的目的是发展基于规则的情感识别决策模型。本研究还提出使用规则来增强使用监督学习技术的多模式系统中的体内识别精度。用于这种基于学习的识别系统的分类器容易过度拟合，并且仅在体内数据上表现良好。为了克服这个限制，本研究提出使用基于规则的模型作为附加模式。规则是基于人类注释协议和将运动和姿势归因于情感的现有研究，使用来自视觉通道的原始特征数据开发的。规则评估的结果在情绪识别系统的决策阶段被结合起来。结果表明基于规则的情感识别增强了基于学习的系统识别的准确性，并且还提供跨语料库情感测试数据的更好的识别率。
