##### Abstract
Global recruitment into radical Islamic movements has spurred renewed interest in the appeal of political extremism. Is the appeal a rational response to material conditions or is it the expression of psychological and personality disorders associated with aggressive behavior, intolerance, conspiratorial imagination, and paranoia? Empirical answers using surveys have been limited by lack of access to extremist groups, while field studies have lacked psychological measures and failed to compare extremists with contrast groups. We revisit the debate over the appeal of extremism in the U.S. context by comparing publicly available Twitter messages written by over 355,000 political extremist followers with messages written by non-extremist U.S. users. Analysis of text-based psychological indicators supports the moral foundation theory which identifies emotion as a critical factor in determining political orientation of individuals. Extremist followers also differ from others in four of the Big Five personality traits.

##### Abstract (translated by Google)
全球招募激进的伊斯兰运动激起了对政治极端主义的吸引力的重新兴趣。这种诉求是否是对物质条件的理性回应，还是表现出与攻击性行为，不容忍，阴谋妄想和偏执狂有关的心理和人格障碍？使用调查得出的经验回答受到缺乏进入极端主义群体的限制，而实地研究缺乏心理测量，没有将极端主义分子与对照组进行比较。我们通过将超过355,000名政治极端主义追随者所写的推特信息与非极端主义美国用户的信息进行比较，再次讨论美国极端主义对美国的吸引力。对基于文本的心理指标的分析支持道德基础理论，该理论将情绪确定为决定个人政治取向的关键因素。极端主义的追随者在五大人格特征中也有四个不同于其他人。
