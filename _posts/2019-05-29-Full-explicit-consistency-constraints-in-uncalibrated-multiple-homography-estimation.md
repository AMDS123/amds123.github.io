##### Abstract
We reveal a complete set of constraints that need to be imposed on a set of 3-by-3 matrices to ensure that the matrices represent genuine homographies associated with multiple planes between two views. We also show how to exploit the constraints to obtain more accurate estimates of homography matrices between two views. Our study resolves a long-standing research question and provides a fresh perspective and a more in-depth understanding of the multiple homography estimation task.
