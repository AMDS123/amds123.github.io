##### Abstract
Machine learning is increasingly used to make sense of the physical world yet may suffer from adversarial manipulation. We examine the Viola-Jones 2D face detection algorithm to study whether images can be created that humans do not notice as faces yet the algorithm detects as faces. We show that it is possible to construct images that Viola-Jones recognizes as containing faces yet no human would consider a face. Moreover, we show that it is possible to construct images that fool facial detection even when they are printed and then photographed.

机器学习越来越多地用于理解物理世界，但可能遭受对抗性操纵。我们研究了Viola-Jones 2D人脸检测算法，以研究是否可以创建人脸不会注意到的人脸图像，而算法检测为人脸。我们表明，有可能构建的图像，中提琴琼斯认识到包含面孔，但没有人会考虑一张脸。此外，我们表明，即使在打印和拍照时，也可以构建出愚弄面部检测的图像。
