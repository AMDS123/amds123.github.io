##### Abstract
Generative adversarial networks (GANs) have shown great promise in generating complex data such as images. A standard practice in GANs is to discard the discriminator after training and use only the generator for sampling. However, this loses valuable information of real data distribution learned by the discriminator. In this work, we propose a collaborative sampling scheme between the generator and discriminator for improved data generation. Guided by the discriminator, our approach refines generated samples through gradient-based optimization, shifting the generator distribution closer to the real data distribution. Additionally, we present a practical discriminator shaping method that can further improve the sample refinement process. Orthogonal to existing GAN variants, our proposed method offers a new degree of freedom in GAN sampling. We demonstrate its efficacy through experiments on synthetic data and image generation tasks.
