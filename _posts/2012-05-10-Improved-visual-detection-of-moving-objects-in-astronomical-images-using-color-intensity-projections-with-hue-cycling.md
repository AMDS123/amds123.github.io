##### Abstract
While fully automated methods for detecting faint moving objects in astronomical images - such as Kuiper belt objects (KBOs) - are constantly improving, visual detection still has a role to play especially when the fixed background is cluttered with stars. Color intensity projections (CIPs) using hue cycling - which combines a sequence of greyscale images into a single color image - aids in the visual detection of moving objects by highlighting them using color in an intuitive way. To demonstrate the usefulness of CIPs in detecting faint moving objects a sequence of 16 images from the SuprimeCam camera of the Subaru telescope were combined into a CIPs image. As well has making even faint moving objects easier to visually detect against a cluttered background, CCD artefacts were also more easily recognisable. The new Hyper SuprimeCam for the Subaru telescope - which will allow many short exposure images to be acquired with little dead time between images - should provide ideal data for use with the CIPs algorithm. In addition, the current search for KBOs to be targeted by the New Horizon's spacecraft after its flyby of Pluto provides an excellent test case for the state of the art in faint moving object detection against a cluttered background.

虽然用于检测天文图像中微弱移动物体的全自动方法（例如柯伊伯带状物体（KBO））正在不断改进，但是当固定背景与星星混杂在一起时，视觉检测仍然起着一定的作用。使用色调循环的色彩强度投影（CIP） - 将一系列灰度图像组合成单一色彩的图像 - 通过直观的方式使用颜色突出显示运动物体，从而帮助进行视觉检测。为了证明CIP在检测微弱移动物体方面的实用性，Subaru望远镜的SuprimeCam摄像机的16幅图像被组合成一张CIP图像。而且，即使微弱的移动物体也能够更容易地在杂乱的背景下进行视觉检测，所以CCD伪影也更容易识别。斯巴鲁望远镜新的超SuprimeCam  - 这将允许许多短曝光图像获得与图像之间的死亡时间很少 - 应提供理想的数据与CIPs算法一起使用。此外，目前搜寻新地平线飞船冥王星飞行后瞄准的KBO，提供了一个优秀的测试案例，可以在杂乱的背景下进行微弱的移动物体检测。
