##### Abstract
Depth from defocus and defocus deblurring from a single image are two challenging problems that are derived from the finite depth of field in conventional cameras. Coded aperture imaging is one of the techniques that is used for improving the results of these two problems. Up to now, different methods have been proposed for improving the results of either defocus deblurring or depth estimation. In this paper, a multi-objective function is proposed for evaluating and designing aperture patterns with the aim of improving the results of both depth from defocus and defocus deblurring. Pattern evaluation is performed by considering the scene illumination condition and camera system specification. Based on the proposed criteria, a single asymmetric pattern is designed that is used for restoring a sharp image and a depth map from a single input. Since the designed pattern is asymmetric, defocus objects on the two sides of the focal plane can be distinguished. Depth estimation is performed by using a new algorithm, which is based on image quality assessment criteria and can distinguish between blurred objects lying in front or behind the focal plane. Extensive simulations as well as experiments on a variety of real scenes are conducted to compare our aperture with previously proposed ones.

从单个图像的散焦和散焦去模糊的深度是两个具有挑战性的问题，这些问题是由常规相机的有限景深引起的。编码孔径成像是用于改善这两个问题的结果的技术之一。到目前为止，已经提出了不同的方法来改善散焦去模糊或深度估计的结果。本文提出了一种多目标函数来评价和设计光圈图案，以提高离焦和散焦去模糊效果。通过考虑场景照明条件和照相机系统规格来执行图案评估。基于所提出的标准，设计单个不对称图案，用于从单个输入恢复清晰的图像和深度图。由于设计的图案是不对称的，因此可以区分焦平面两侧的散焦物体。深度估计通过使用基于图像质量评估标准的新算法来执行，并且可以区分位于焦平面之前或之后的模糊物体。进行大量的模拟以及在各种真实场景下的实验来比较我们的孔径与先前提出的孔径。
