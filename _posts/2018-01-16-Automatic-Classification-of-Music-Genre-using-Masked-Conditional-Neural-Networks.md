##### Abstract
Neural network based architectures used for sound recognition are usually adapted from other application domains such as image recognition, which may not harness the time-frequency representation of a signal. The ConditionaL Neural Networks (CLNN) and its extension the Masked ConditionaL Neural Networks (MCLNN) are designed for multidimensional temporal signal recognition. The CLNN is trained over a window of frames to preserve the inter-frame relation, and the MCLNN enforces a systematic sparseness over the network's links that mimics a filterbank-like behavior. The masking operation induces the network to learn in frequency bands, which decreases the network susceptibility to frequency-shifts in time-frequency representations. Additionally, the mask allows an exploration of a range of feature combinations concurrently analogous to the manual handcrafting of the optimum collection of features for a recognition task. MCLNN have achieved competitive performance on the Ballroom music dataset compared to several hand-crafted attempts and outperformed models based on state-of-the-art Convolutional Neural Networks.

用于声音识别的基于神经网络的体系结构通常适用于其他应用领域，如图像识别，这些应用领域可能无法利用信号的时频表示。 ConditionaL神经网络（CLNN）及其扩展Masked ConditionaL神经网络（MCLNN）被设计用于多维时间信号识别。 CLNN在帧的窗口上被训练以保持帧间关系，并且MCLNN在网络的链路上强制系统稀疏，这模仿类似滤波器组的行为。掩蔽操作导致网络在频带中学习，这降低了网络在时频表示中对频移的敏感性。此外，蒙版允许探索一系列特征组合，同时类似于为识别任务手动手工制作最佳特征集合。 MCLNN已经在舞厅音乐数据集上获得了相对于几次手工尝试的竞争优势，并且在先进的卷积神经网络基础上获得了优异的表现。
