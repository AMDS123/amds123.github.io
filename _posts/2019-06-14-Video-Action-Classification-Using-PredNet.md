##### Abstract
In this paper, we evaluate the PredNet \cite{lotter16} on the Something-something action data set \cite{farzaneh18} and implement the PredNet+, which we train in a multi-task fashion to output both classification labels and predictions. Our idea is to condition video prediction and action classification on each other. We discuss a series of observations about the PredNet and conclude that it does not completely follow the principles of the predictive coding framework.
