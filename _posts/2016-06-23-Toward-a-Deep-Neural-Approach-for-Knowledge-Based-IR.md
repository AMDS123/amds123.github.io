##### Abstract
This paper tackles the problem of the semantic gap between a document and a query within an ad-hoc information retrieval task. In this context, knowledge bases (KBs) have already been acknowledged as valuable means since they allow the representation of explicit relations between entities. However, they do not necessarily represent implicit relations that could be hidden in a corpora. This latter issue is tackled by recent works dealing with deep representation learn ing of texts. With this in mind, we argue that embedding KBs within deep neural architectures supporting documentquery matching would give rise to fine-grained latent representations of both words and their semantic relations. In this paper, we review the main approaches of neural-based document ranking as well as those approaches for latent representation of entities and relations via KBs. We then propose some avenues to incorporate KBs in deep neural approaches for document ranking. More particularly, this paper advocates that KBs can be used either to support enhanced latent representations of queries and documents based on both distributional and relational semantics or to serve as a semantic translator between their latent distributional representations.

本文解决了特定信息检索任务中文档和查询之间的语义鸿沟问题。在这种情况下，知识库（KB）已经被认为是有价值的手段，因为它们允许表示实体之间的显式关系。然而，它们并不一定代表可能隐藏在语料库中的隐含关系。后面这个问题是由最近处理深度代表性学习文本的工作来解决的。考虑到这一点，我们认为将深度神经网络嵌入到支持文档查询匹配的深层神经结构中将会引起对这两个词及其语义关系的细粒度的潜在表示。在本文中，我们回顾了基于神经的文档排序的主要方法以及通过知识库的实体和关系的潜在表示的方法。然后，我们提出了一些途径来将KB纳入用于文档排名的深度神经方法。更具体地说，本文提倡KB可以用来支持基于分布和关系语义的查询和文档的增强型潜在表示，或者作为其潜在分布表示之间的语义翻译。
