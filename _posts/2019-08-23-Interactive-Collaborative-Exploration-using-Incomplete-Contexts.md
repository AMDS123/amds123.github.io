##### Abstract
A common representation of information about relations of objects and attributes in knowledge domains are data-tables. The structure of such information can be analysed using Formal Concept Analysis (FCA). Attribute exploration is a knowledge acquisition method from FCA that reveals dependencies in a set of attributes with help of a domain expert. However, in general no single expert is capable (time- and knowledge-wise) of exploring knowledge domains alone. Therefore it is important to develop methods that allow multiple experts to explore domains together. To this end we build upon results on representation of incomplete knowledge [2, 8-10], adapt the corresponding version of attribute exploration to fit the setting of multiple experts and suggest formalizations for key components like expert knowledge, interaction and collaboration strategy. Furthermore we discuss ways of comparing collaboration strategies and suggest avenues for future research.
