##### Abstract
With the immense number of videos being uploaded to the video sharing sites, issue of copyright infringement arises with uploading of illicit copies or transformed versions of original video. Thus safeguarding copyright of digital media has become matter of concern. To address this concern, it is obliged to have a video copy detection system which is sufficiently robust to detect these transformed videos with ability to pinpoint location of copied segments. This paper outlines recent advancement in content based video copy detection, mainly focusing on different visual features employed by video copy detection systems. Finally we evaluate performance of existing video copy detection systems.

随着大量视频上传到视频分享网站，上传非法拷贝或原始视频转换版本就会出现侵犯版权的问题。因此，保护​​数字媒体的版权成为关注的问题。为了解决这个问题，必须有一个足够强大的视频拷贝检测系统来检测这些经过转换的视频，能够精确定位复制的段的位置。本文概述了基于内容的视频拷贝检测的最新进展，主要集中在视频拷贝检测系统采用的不同视觉特征。最后，我们评估现有的视频拷贝检测系统的性能。
