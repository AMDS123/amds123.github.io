##### Abstract
Active depth cameras suffer from several limitations, which cause incomplete and noisy depth maps, and may consequently affect the performance of RGB-D Odometry. To address this issue, this paper presents a visual odometry method based on point and line features that leverages both measurements from a depth sensor and depth estimates from camera motion. Depth estimates are generated continuously by a probabilistic depth estimation framework for both types of features to compensate for the lack of depth measurements and inaccurate feature depth associations. The framework models explicitly the uncertainty of triangulating depth from both point and line observations to validate and obtain precise estimates. Furthermore, depth measurements are exploited by propagating them through a depth map registration module and using a frame-to-frame motion estimation method that considers 3D-to-2D and 2D-to-3D reprojection errors, independently. Results on RGB-D sequences captured on large indoor and outdoor scenes, where depth sensor limitations are critical, show that the combination of depth measurements and estimates through our approach is able to overcome the absence and inaccuracy of depth measurements.

主动深度相机受到几个限制，导致深度图不完整和嘈杂，并可能因此影响RGB-D Odometry的性能。为了解决这个问题，本文提出了基于点和线特征的视觉测距方法，该方法利用来自深度传感器的测量和来自相机运动的深度估计。深度估计是由两种特征的概率深度估计框架连续产生的，以补偿缺乏深度测量和不准确的特征深度关联。该框架明确地模拟了从点观测到观测到的三角测量深度的不确定性，以验证和获得精确的估计。此外，深度测量通过将其传播通过深度图配准模块并使用考虑3D到2D和2D到3D再投影错误的帧到帧运动估计方法而被利用。在深度传感器限制至关重要的大型室内和室外场景上捕获的RGB-D序列的结果表明，通过我们的方法进行的深度测量和估计的组合能够克服深度测量的缺失和不准确性。
