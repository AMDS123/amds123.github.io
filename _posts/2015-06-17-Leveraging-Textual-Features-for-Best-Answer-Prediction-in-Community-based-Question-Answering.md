##### Abstract
This paper addresses the problem of determining the best answer in Community-based Question Answering (CQA) websites by focussing on the content. In particular, we present a system, ACQUA [this http URL], that can be installed onto the majority of browsers as a plugin. The service offers a seamless and accurate prediction of the answer to be accepted. Previous research on this topic relies on the exploitation of community feedback on the answers, which involves rating of either users (e.g., reputation) or answers (e.g. scores manually assigned to answers). We propose a new technique that leverages the content/textual features of answers in a novel way. Our approach delivers better results than related linguistics-based solutions and manages to match rating-based approaches. More specifically, the gain in performance is achieved by rendering the values of these features into a discretised form. We also show how our technique manages to deliver equally good results in real-time settings, as opposed to having to rely on information not always readily available, such as user ratings and answer scores. We ran an evaluation on 21 StackExchange websites covering around 4 million questions and more than 8 million answers. We obtain 84% average precision and 70% recall, which shows that our technique is robust, effective, and widely applicable.

本文针对基于社区的问答（CQA）网站中关注内容确定最佳答案的问题。特别是，我们提供了一个系统，ACQUA [这个http URL]，可以作为插件安装到大多数浏览器上。该服务提供了一个无缝和准确的答案被接受的预测。以前对这个话题的研究依赖于利用社区对答案的反馈，其中涉及对用户（例如声誉）或答案（例如手动分配给答案的评分）的评分。我们提出了一种以新颖的方式利用答案的内容/文本特征的新技术。我们的方法比相关的基于语言学的解决方案提供更好的结果，并设法匹配基于评级的方法。更具体地说，性能的提高是通过将这些特征的值呈现为离散的形式来实现的。我们还展示了我们的技术如何能够在实时环境中提供同样好的结果，而不是依赖不总是容易获得的信息，例如用户评分和答案分数。我们对21个StackExchange网站进行了评估，覆盖了大约400万个问题和800多万个答案。我们获得84％的平均精度和70％的召回率，这表明我们的技术是强大的，有效的，广泛适用的。
