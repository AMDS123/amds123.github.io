##### Abstract
Image Registration is the process of aligning two or more images of the same scene with reference to a particular image. The images are captured from various sensors at different times and at multiple view-points. Thus to get a better picture of any change of a scene or object over a considerable period of time image registration is important. Image registration finds application in medical sciences, remote sensing and in computer vision. This paper presents a detailed review of several approaches which are classified accordingly along with their contributions and drawbacks. The main steps of an image registration procedure are also discussed. Different performance measures are presented that determine the registration quality and accuracy. The scope for the future research are presented as well.

图像配准是指参照特定图像对齐同一场景的两幅或多幅图像的过程。在不同的时间和多个视点从不同的传感器捕获图像。因此，为了在相当长的一段时间内更好地了解场景或对象的任何变化，图像配准是非常重要的。图像注册适用于医学，遥感和计算机视觉。本文详细回顾了几种相应的方法，以及它们的贡献和缺点。还讨论了图像注册程序的主要步骤。提出了不同的绩效衡量标准，以确定注册质量和准确性。还介绍了未来研究的范围。
