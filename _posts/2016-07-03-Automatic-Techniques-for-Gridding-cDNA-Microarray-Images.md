##### Abstract
Microarray is considered an important instrument and powerful new technology for large-scale gene sequence and gene expression analysis. One of the major challenges of this technique is the image processing phase. The accuracy of this phase has an important impact on the accuracy and effectiveness of the subsequent gene expression and identification analysis. The processing can be organized mainly into four steps: gridding, spot isolation, segmentation, and quantification. Although several commercial software packages are now available, microarray image analysis still requires some intervention by the user, and thus a certain level of image processing expertise. This paper describes and compares four techniques that perform automatic gridding and spot isolation. The proposed techniques are based on template matching technique, standard deviation, sum, and derivative of these profiles. Experimental results show that the accuracy of the derivative of the sum profile is highly accurate compared to other techniques for good and poor quality microarray images.

微阵列被认为是大规模基因序列和基因表达分析的重要手段和强大的新技术。这种技术的主要挑战之一是图像处理阶段。这一阶段的准确性对后续基因表达和鉴定分析的准确性和有效性有重要影响。处理可以主要分为四个步骤：网格化，点隔离，分割和量化。虽然现在有几种商业软件包可用，但微阵列图像分析仍然需要用户进行一些干预，从而具有一定的图像处理专业水平。本文介绍并比较了四种执行自动网格化和点分离的技术。所提出的技术基于模板匹配技术，标准偏差，总和，以及这些简档的导数。实验结果表明，与其他技术相比，总和分布的导数的精确性是高度准确的，以便获得良好的质量差的微阵列图像。
