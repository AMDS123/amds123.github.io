##### Abstract
Spoken dialogue systems allow humans to interact with machines using natural speech. As such, they have many benefits. By using speech as the primary communication medium, a computer interface can facilitate swift, human-like acquisition of information. In recent years, speech interfaces have become ever more popular, as is evident from the rise of personal assistants such as Siri, Google Now, Cortana and Amazon Alexa. Recently, data-driven machine learning methods have been applied to dialogue modelling and the results achieved for limited-domain applications are comparable to or outperform traditional approaches. Methods based on Gaussian processes are particularly effective as they enable good models to be estimated from limited training data. Furthermore, they provide an explicit estimate of the uncertainty which is particularly useful for reinforcement learning. This article explores the additional steps that are necessary to extend these methods to model multiple dialogue domains. We show that Gaussian process reinforcement learning is an elegant framework that naturally supports a range of methods, including prior knowledge, Bayesian committee machines and multi-agent learning, for facilitating extensible and adaptable dialogue systems.

##### Abstract (translated by Google)
口语对话系统允许人类使用自然语言与机器进行交互。因此，他们有很多好处。通过使用语音作为主要的通信媒介，计算机接口可以促进信息的快速，人性化的获取。近年来，语音界面变得越来越流行，从Siri，Google Now，Cortana和Amazon Alexa等个人助理的兴起即可见一斑。最近，数据驱动的机器学习方法已经应用于对话建模，并且有限领域应用所达到的结果可以与传统方法相媲美或超越传统方法。基于高斯过程的方法是特别有效的，因为它们能够从有限的训练数据中估计好的模型。此外，它们提供了对强化学习特别有用的不确定性的明确估计。本文将探讨扩展这些方法以模拟多个对话域所需的附加步骤。我们表明，高斯过程强化学习是一个优雅的框架，自然支持一系列的方法，包括先验知识，贝叶斯委员会机器和多代理学习，以促进可扩展和适应性对话系统。
