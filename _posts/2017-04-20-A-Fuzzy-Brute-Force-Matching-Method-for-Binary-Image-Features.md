##### Abstract
Matching of binary image features is an important step in many different computer vision applications. Conventionally, an arbitrary threshold is used to identify a correct match from incorrect matches using Hamming distance which may improve or degrade the matching results for different input images. This is mainly due to the image content which is affected by the scene, lighting and imaging conditions. This paper presents a fuzzy logic based approach for brute force matching of image features to overcome this situation. The method was tested using a well-known image database with known ground truth. The approach is shown to produce a higher number of correct matches when compared against constant distance thresholds. The nature of fuzzy logic which allows the vagueness of information and tolerance to errors has been successfully exploited in an image processing context. The uncertainty arising from the imaging conditions has been overcome with the use of compact fuzzy matching membership functions.

二进制图像特征的匹配在许多不同的计算机视觉应用中是重要的一步。传统上，使用任意阈值来从使用汉明距离的错误匹配中识别正确匹配，这可以改善或降低针对不同输入图像的匹配结果。这主要是由于受到场景，照明和成像条件影响的图像内容。本文提出了一种基于模糊逻辑的图像特征蛮力匹配方法来克服这种情况。该方法使用具有已知基本事实的公知图像数据库进行测试。与常量距离阈值相比，该方法显示产生更多的正确匹配。模糊逻辑的性质使得信息的模糊性和对错误的容忍度在图像处理环境中被成功地利用。使用紧凑模糊匹配隶属函数克服了由成像条件引起的不确定性。
