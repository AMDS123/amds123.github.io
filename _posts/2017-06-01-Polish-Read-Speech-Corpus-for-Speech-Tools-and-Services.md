##### Abstract
This paper describes the speech processing activities conducted at the Polish consortium of the CLARIN project. The purpose of this segment of the project was to develop specific tools that would allow for automatic and semi-automatic processing of large quantities of acoustic speech data. The tools include the following: grapheme-to-phoneme conversion, speech-to-text alignment, voice activity detection, speaker diarization, keyword spotting and automatic speech transcription. Furthermore, in order to develop these tools, a large high-quality studio speech corpus was recorded and released under an open license, to encourage development in the area of Polish speech research. Another purpose of the corpus was to serve as a reference for studies in phonetics and pronunciation. All the tools and resources were released on the the Polish CLARIN website. This paper discusses the current status and future plans for the project.

本文介绍了在CLARIN项目的波兰联盟进行的语音处理活动。该项目的这一部分的目的是开发特定的工具，以允许自动和半自动处理大量的声学语音数据。这些工具包括：字形到音素的转换，语音到文本的对齐，语音活动检测，说话者diarization，关键词识别和自动语音转录。此外，为了开发这些工具，一个大型高质量的工作室演讲语料库在公开许可下被录制和发布，以鼓励在波兰语言研究领域的发展。语料库的另一个目的是作为语音和发音研究的参考。所有的工具和资源都在波兰的CLARIN网站上发布。本文讨论了该项目的现状和未来计划。
