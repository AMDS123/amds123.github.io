##### Abstract
Several deep learning models have been proposed for question answering. However, due to their single-pass nature, they have no way to recover from local maxima corresponding to incorrect answers. To address this problem, we introduce the Dynamic Coattention Network (DCN) for question answering. The DCN first fuses co-dependent representations of the question and the document in order to focus on relevant parts of both. Then a dynamic pointing decoder iterates over potential answer spans. This iterative procedure enables the model to recover from initial local maxima corresponding to incorrect answers. On the Stanford question answering dataset, a single DCN model improves the previous state of the art from 71.0% F1 to 75.9%, while a DCN ensemble obtains 80.4% F1.

已经提出了几个深度学习模型来回答问题。但是，由于其单程性质，他们无法从当地最大值恢复相应的不正确答案。为了解决这个问题，我们引入动态Coattention网络（DCN）进行问答。 DCN首先融合问题和文件的相互依存表达，以便集中在两者的相关部分。然后动态指针解码器遍历潜在的答案跨度。这个迭代过程使模型从初始局部最大值恢复对应于不正确的答案。在斯坦福问答数据集中，单个DCN模型将先前的现状从71.0％F1提高到75.9％，而DCN合奏获得80.4％F1。
