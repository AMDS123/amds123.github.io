##### Abstract
Deep neural networks (DNN) and Gaussian processes (GP) are two powerful models with several theoretical connections relating them, but the relationship between their training methods is not well understood. In this paper, we show that certain Gaussian posterior approximations for Bayesian DNNs are equivalent to GP posteriors. As a result, we can obtain a GP kernel and a nonlinear feature map simply by training the DNN. Surprisingly, the resulting kernel is the neural tangent kernel which has desirable theoretical properties for infinitely-wide DNNs. We show feature maps obtained on real datasets and demonstrate the use of the GP marginal likelihood to tune hyperparameters of DNNs. Our work aims to facilitate further research on combining DNNs and GPs in practical settings.
