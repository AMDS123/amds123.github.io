##### Abstract
A Pascal challenge entitled monaural multi-talker speech recognition was developed, targeting the problem of robust automatic speech recognition against speech like noises which significantly degrades the performance of automatic speech recognition systems. In this challenge, two competing speakers say a simple command simultaneously and the objective is to recognize speech of the target speaker. Surprisingly during the challenge, a team from IBM research, could achieve a performance better than human listeners on this task. The proposed method of the IBM team, consist of an intermediate speech separation and then a single-talker speech recognition. This paper reconsiders the task of this challenge based on gain adapted factorial speech processing models. It develops a joint-token passing algorithm for direct utterance decoding of both target and masker speakers, simultaneously. Comparing it to the challenge winner, it uses maximum uncertainty during the decoding which cannot be used in the past two-phased method. It provides detailed derivation of inference on these models based on general inference procedures of probabilistic graphical models. As another improvement, it uses deep neural networks for joint-speaker identification and gain estimation which makes these two steps easier than before producing competitive results for these steps. The proposed method of this work outperforms past super-human results and even the results were achieved recently by Microsoft research, using deep neural networks. It achieved 5.5% absolute task performance improvement compared to the first super-human system and 2.7% absolute task performance improvement compared to its recent competitor.

开发了题为单声道多说话者语音识别的帕斯卡（Pascal）挑战，针对抗噪音等语音的鲁棒自动语音识别问题，这显着降低了自动语音识别系统的性能。在这个挑战中，两个竞争对手同时说一个简单的命令，目标是识别目标说话人的语音。令人惊讶的是，在这个挑战中，来自IBM研究的一个团队在这个任务上可以获得比听众更好的表现。所提出的IBM团队的方法包括中间语音分离和单个讲话者语音识别。本文重新考虑了基于增益适应因子语音处理模型的这一挑战的任务。它同时发展了一个联合令牌传递算法，用于目标和掩蔽说话者的直接话语解码。与挑战获胜者相比，它在解码过程中使用了最大的不确定性，而这在过去的两阶段方法中是不能使用的。它提供了基于概率图模型的一般推理过程对这些模型推导的详细推导。作为另一个改进，它使用深度神经网络进行联合说话人识别和增益估计，这使得这两个步骤比之前为这些步骤产生竞争结果更容易。这项工作的建议方法胜过了过去的超人类的结果，甚至最近微软公司的研究成果都是使用深度神经网络来实现的。与第一个超人类系统相比，它的绝对任务性能提高了5.5％，绝对任务性能提高了2.7％。
