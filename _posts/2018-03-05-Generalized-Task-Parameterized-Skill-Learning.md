##### Abstract
Programming by demonstration has recently gained much attention due to its user-friendly and natural way to transfer human skills to robots. In order to facilitate the learning of multiple demonstrations and meanwhile generalize to new situations, a task-parameterized Gaussian mixture model (TP-GMM) has been recently developed. This model has achieved reliable performance in areas such as human-robot collaboration and dual-arm manipulation. However, the crucial task frames and associated parameters in this learning framework are often set by the human teacher, which renders three problems that have not been addressed yet: (i) task frames are treated equally, without considering their individual importance, (ii) task parameters are defined without taking into account additional task constraints, such as robot joint limits and motion smoothness, and (iii) a fixed number of task frames are pre-defined regardless of whether some of them may be redundant or even irrelevant for the task at hand. In this paper, we generalize the task-parameterized learning by addressing the aforementioned problems. Moreover, we provide a novel learning perspective which allows the robot to refine and adapt previously learned skills in a low dimensional space. Several examples are studied in both simulated and real robotic systems, showing the applicability of our approach.

通过示范编程最近受到了很多关注，因为它以人性化和自然的方式将人类技能传递给机器人。为了便于多次演示的学习，同时推广到新的情况，最近开发了任务参数化的高斯混合模型（TP-GMM）。该模型在人机协作和双臂操纵等领域取得了可靠的性能。然而，这个学习框架中的关键任务框架和相关参数通常由人类老师设定，这导致了三个尚未解决的问题：（i）任务框架被平等对待，没有考虑到他们个人的重要性，（ii）任务参数是在不考虑附加任务约束的情况下定义的，例如机器人关节限制和运动平滑度，以及（iii）固定数量的任务框架是预先定义的，而不管它们中的一些可能是多余的甚至与任务无关在眼前。在本文中，我们通过解决上述问题来推广任务参数化学习。此外，我们提供了一种新颖的学习视角，使机器人能够在低维空间中细化和适应先前学到的技能。在模拟和真实机器人系统中都研究了几个例子，显示了我们方法的适用性。
