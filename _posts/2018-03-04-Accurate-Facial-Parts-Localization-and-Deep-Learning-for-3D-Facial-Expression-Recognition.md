##### Abstract
Meaningful facial parts can convey key cues for both facial action unit detection and expression prediction. Textured 3D face scan can provide both detailed 3D geometric shape and 2D texture appearance cues of the face which are beneficial for Facial Expression Recognition (FER). However, accurate facial parts extraction as well as their fusion are challenging tasks. In this paper, a novel system for 3D FER is designed based on accurate facial parts extraction and deep feature fusion of facial parts. In particular, each textured 3D face scan is firstly represented as a 2D texture map and a depth map with one-to-one dense correspondence. Then, the facial parts of both texture map and depth map are extracted using a novel 4-stage process consists of facial landmark localization, facial rotation correction, facial resizing, facial parts bounding box extraction and post-processing procedures. Finally, deep fusion Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) features of all facial parts are learned from both texture maps and depth maps, respectively and nonlinear SVMs are used for expression prediction. Experiments are conducted on the BU-3DFE database, demonstrating the effectiveness of combing different facial parts, texture and depth cues and reporting the state-of-the-art results in comparison with all existing methods under the same setting.

有意义的脸部可以传达面部动作单元检测和表情预测的关键线索。带纹理的3D人脸扫描可以提供详细的3D几何形状和面部表情识别（FER）有益的2D纹理外观提示。然而，准确的脸部提取以及它们的融合是具有挑战性的任务。本文提出了一种基于精确脸部提取和脸部深部特征融合的全新三维FER系统。具体而言，每个纹理化的3D人脸扫描首先被表示为具有一对一密集对应关系的2D纹理图和深度图。然后，使用由面部标志点定位，面部旋转校正，面部尺寸调整，面部部分包围盒提取和后处理程序组成的新的4阶段过程来提取纹理图和深度图的面部部分。最后，分别从纹理贴图和深度贴图中学习所有面部的深度融合卷积神经网络（CNNs）特征，并将非线性SVM用于表达预测。在BU-3DFE数据库上进行实验，证明梳理不同面部部分，纹理和深度线索的有效性，并与相同设置下的所有现有方法进行比较，报告最先进的结果。
