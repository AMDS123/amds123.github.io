##### Abstract
Languages employ different strategies to transmit structural and grammatical information. While, for example, grammatical dependency relationships in sentences are mainly conveyed by the ordering of the words for languages like Mandarin Chinese, or Vietnamese, the word ordering is much less restricted for languages such as Inupiatun or Quechua, as those languages (also) use the internal structure of words (e.g. inflectional morphology) to mark grammatical relationships in a sentence. Based on a quantitative analysis of more than 1,500 unique translations of different books of the Bible in more than 1,100 different languages that are spoken as a native language by approximately 6 billion people (more than 80% of the world population), we present large-scale evidence for a statistical trade-off between the amount of information conveyed by the ordering of words and the amount of information conveyed by internal word structure: languages that rely more strongly on word order information tend to rely less on word structure information and vice versa. In addition, we find that - despite differences in the way information is expressed - there is also evidence for a trade-off between different books of the biblical canon that recurs with little variation across languages: the more informative the word order of the book, the less informative its word structure and vice versa. We argue that this might suggest that, on the one hand, languages encode information in very different (but efficient) ways. On the other hand, content-related and stylistic features are statistically encoded in very similar ways.

语言使用不同的策略来传输结构和语法信息。例如，句子中的语法依赖关系主要通过汉语或越南语等单词的排序来表达，但是对于诸如Inupiatun或Quechua等语言，单词排序的限制要少得多，因为这些语言也使用词的内部结构（例如屈折形态）来标记句子中的语法关系。根据约60亿人口（世界人口的80％以上）以超过1,100种不同的语言（作为母语使用的语言）对1500多本不同的圣经的翻译进行定量分析，大量的证据表明，在单词排序传达的信息量与内部单词结构传达的信息量之间存在统计上的平衡：更依赖于单词信息的语言倾向于较少依赖单词结构信息，反之亦然。另外，我们发现尽管信息表达方式不同，但也有证据表明，圣经正典的不同书籍之间存在着一种平衡，这种书籍在各种语言之间几乎没有什么变化：书中词序更丰富，其字结构的信息量较少，反之亦然。我们认为，这可能表明，一方面，语言以非常不同（但有效）的方式编码信息。另一方面，内容相关和文体特征以非常相似的方式统计编码。
