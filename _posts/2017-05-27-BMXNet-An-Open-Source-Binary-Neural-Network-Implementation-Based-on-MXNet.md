##### Abstract
Binary Neural Networks (BNNs) can drastically reduce memory size and accesses by applying bit-wise operations instead of standard arithmetic operations. Therefore it could significantly improve the efficiency and lower the energy consumption at runtime, which enables the application of state-of-the-art deep learning models on low power devices. BMXNet is an open-source BNN library based on MXNet, which supports both XNOR-Networks and Quantized Neural Networks. The developed BNN layers can be seamlessly applied with other standard library components and work in both GPU and CPU mode. BMXNet is maintained and developed by the multimedia research group at Hasso Plattner Institute and released under Apache license. Extensive experiments validate the efficiency and effectiveness of our implementation. The BMXNet library, several sample projects, and a collection of pre-trained binary deep models are available for download at this https URL

二进制神经网络（BNN）可以通过应用按位操作而不是标准的算术运算来大幅度地减少存储器的大小和访问。因此，它可以显着提高效率，降低运行时的能耗，从而可以将最先进的深度学习模型应用于低功耗设备。 BMXNet是基于MXNet的开源BNN库，支持XNOR网络和量化神经网络。开发的BNN层可以与其他标准库组件无缝应用，并在GPU和CPU模式下工作。 BMXNet由Hasso Plattner Institute的多媒体研究组维护和开发，并在Apache许可下发布。大量的实验验证了我们实现的效率和有效性。 BMXNet库，多个示例项目以及一系列预先训练的二进制深度模型可在此https URL下载
