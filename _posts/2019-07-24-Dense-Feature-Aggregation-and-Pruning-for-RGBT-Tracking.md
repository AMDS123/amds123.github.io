##### Abstract
How to perform effective information fusion of different modalities is a core factor in boosting the performance of RGBT tracking. This paper presents a novel deep fusion algorithm based on the representations from an end-to-end trained convolutional neural network. To deploy the complementarity of features of all layers, we propose a recursive strategy to densely aggregate these features that yield robust representations of target objects in each modality. In different modalities, we propose to prune the densely aggregated features of all modalities in a collaborative way. In a specific, we employ the operations of global average pooling and weighted random selection to perform channel scoring and selection, which could remove redundant and noisy features to achieve more robust feature representation. Experimental results on two RGBT tracking benchmark datasets suggest that our tracker achieves clear state-of-the-art against other RGB and RGBT tracking methods.
