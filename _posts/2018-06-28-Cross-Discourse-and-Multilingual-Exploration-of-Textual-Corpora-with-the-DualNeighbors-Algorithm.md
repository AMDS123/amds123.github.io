##### Abstract
Word choice is dependent on the cultural context of writers and their subjects. Different words are used to describe similar actions, objects, and features based on factors such as class, race, gender, geography and political affinity. Exploratory techniques based on locating and counting words may, therefore, lead to conclusions that reinforce culturally inflected boundaries. We offer a new method, the DualNeighbors algorithm, for linking thematically similar documents both within and across discursive and linguistic barriers to reveal cross-cultural connections. Qualitative and quantitative evaluations of this technique are shown as applied to two cultural datasets of interest to researchers across the humanities and social sciences. An open-source implementation of the DualNeighbors algorithm is provided to assist in its application.

##### Abstract (translated by Google)
单词的选择取决于作家及其主题的文化背景。不同的词用于描述基于类别，种族，性别，地理和政治亲和力等因素的类似行为，对象和特征。因此，基于对单词进行定位和计数的探索性技术可以得出结论，这些结论可以强化文化上的边界。我们提供了一种新的方法，即DualNeighbors算法，用于在话语和语言障碍之间和之间链接主题相似的文档，以揭示跨文化联系。该技术的定性和定量评估显示为适用于整个人文和社会科学研究人员感兴趣的两个文化数据集。提供DualNeighbors算法的开源实现来协助其应用。
