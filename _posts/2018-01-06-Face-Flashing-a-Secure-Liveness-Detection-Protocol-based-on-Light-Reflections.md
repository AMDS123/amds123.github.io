##### Abstract
Face authentication systems are becoming increasingly prevalent, especially with the rapid development of Deep Learning technologies. However, human facial information is easy to be captured and reproduced, which makes face authentication systems vulnerable to various attacks. Liveness detection is an important defense technique to prevent such attacks, but existing solutions did not provide clear and strong security guarantees, especially in terms of time. 
 To overcome these limitations, we propose a new liveness detection protocol called Face Flashing that significantly increases the bar for launching successful attacks on face authentication systems. By randomly flashing well-designed pictures on a screen and analyzing the reflected light, our protocol has leveraged physical characteristics of human faces: reflection processing at the speed of light, unique textual features, and uneven 3D shapes. Cooperating with working mechanism of the screen and digital cameras, our protocol is able to detect subtle traces left by an attacking process. 
 To demonstrate the effectiveness of Face Flashing, we implemented a prototype and performed thorough evaluations with large data set collected from real-world scenarios. The results show that our Timing Verification can effectively detect the time gap between legitimate authentications and malicious cases. Our Face Verification can also differentiate 2D plane from 3D objects accurately. The overall accuracy of our liveness detection system is 98.8\%, and its robustness was evaluated in different scenarios. In the worst case, our system's accuracy decreased to a still-high 97.3\%.

人脸认证系统越来越普遍，特别是随着深度学习技术的快速发展。然而，人脸信息容易被捕获和再现，这使得脸部认证系统容易受到各种攻击。生存性检测是防止此类攻击的重要防御技术，但现有的解决方案并没有提供明确而强大的安全保证，尤其是在时间上。
 为了克服这些限制，我们提出了一种新的活跃检测协议，称为Face Flashing，它显着增加了在脸部认证系统上发起成功攻击的标准。通过在屏幕上随机闪烁精心设计的图片并分析反射光，我们的协议利用了人脸的物理特性：光速反射处理，独特的文本特征和不均匀的3D形状。配合屏幕和数码相机的工作机制，我们的协议能够检测攻击过程留下的细微痕迹。
 为了演示Face Flashing的有效性，我们实现了一个原型，并使用从实际场景中收集的大型数据集进行了彻底的评估。结果表明，我们的时间验证可以有效地检测合法认证与恶意案件之间的时间差距。我们的人脸识别还可以准确地区分二维平面和三维物体。我们的活体检测系统的总体准确率是98.8％，并且在不同情况下评估了它的健壮性。在最坏的情况下，我们的系统精度降到了97.3％。
