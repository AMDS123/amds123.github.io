##### Abstract
The traditional methods of image assessment, such as mean squared error (MSE), signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), and Peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR), are all based on the absolute error of images. Pearson's inner-product correlation coefficient (PCC) is also usually used to measure the similarity between images. Structural similarity (SSIM) index is another important measurement which has been shown to be more effective in the human vision system (HVS). Although there are many essential differences among these image assessments, some important associations among them as cost functions in linear decomposition are discussed in this paper. Firstly, the selected bases from a basis set for a target vector are the same in the linear decomposition schemes with different cost functions MSE, SSIM, and PCC. Moreover, for a target vector, the ratio of the corresponding affine parameters in the MSE-based linear decomposition scheme and the SSIM-based scheme is a constant, which is just the value of PCC between the target vector and its estimated vector.

图像评估的传统方法，如均方误差（MSE），信噪比（SNR）和峰值信噪比（PSNR）都是基于图像的绝对误差。皮尔逊的内积相关系数（PCC）通常也用来衡量图像之间的相似度。结构相似性（SSIM）指数是在人类视觉系统（HVS）中已被证明更有效的另一个重要测量。虽然这些图像评估之间存在着许多本质的区别，但它们之间的一些重要关联作为线性分解的代价函数进行了讨论。首先，从具有不同成本函数MSE，SSIM和PCC的线性分解方案中，针对目标向量的基集选择的基础是相同的。此外，对于目标矢量，基于MSE的线性分解方案和基于SSIM的方案中的对应仿射参数的比率是常数，它只是目标矢量与其估计矢量之间的PCC的值。
