##### Abstract
The ability to monitor respiratory rate is extremely important for medical treatment, healthcare and fitness sectors. In many situations, mobile methods, which allow users to undertake every day activities, are required. However, current monitoring systems can be obtrusive, requiring users to wear respiration belts or nasal probes. Recent advances in thermographic systems have shrunk their size, weight and cost, to the point where it is possible to create smart-phone based respiration rate monitoring devices that are not affected by lighting conditions. However, mobile thermal imaging is challenged in scenes with high thermal dynamic ranges. This challenge is further amplified by general problems such as motion artifacts and low spatial resolution, leading to unreliable breathing signals. In this paper, we propose a novel and robust approach for respiration tracking which compensates for the negative effects of variations in the ambient temperature and motion artifacts and can accurately extract breathing rates in highly dynamic thermal scenes. It has three main contributions. The first is a novel Optimal Quantization technique which adaptively constructs a color mapping of absolute temperature to improve segmentation, classification and tracking. The second is the Thermal Gradient Flow method that computes thermal gradient magnitude maps to enhance accuracy of the nostril region tracking. Finally, we introduce the Thermal Voxel method to increase the reliability of the captured respiration signals compared to the traditional averaging method. We demonstrate the extreme robustness of our system to track the nostril-region and measure the respiratory rate in high dynamic range scenes.

监测呼吸频率的能力对于医疗，医疗保健和健身行业来说非常重要。在许多情况下，需要使用户每天进行活动的移动方法。然而，目前的监测系统可能是突出的，要求用户佩戴呼吸带或鼻探针。热成像系统的最新进展缩小了它们的尺寸，重量和成本，从而可以创建不受照明条件影响的基于智能手机的呼吸率监测设备。然而，移动热成像在高热动态范围的场景中受到挑战。这个挑战进一步被诸如运动伪影和低空间分辨率等一般问题所放大，导致不可靠的呼吸信号。在本文中，我们提出了一种新颖，稳健的呼吸跟踪方法，可以补偿环境温度和运动伪影变化的负面影响，并可以在高动态热场景中准确提取呼吸率。它有三个主要贡献。首先是一种新的最优量化技术，自适应地构建绝对温度的颜色映射以改善分割，分类和跟踪。其次是热梯度流量法，计算热梯度幅度图，以提高鼻孔区域跟踪的准确性。最后，我们引入了Thermal Voxel方法，与传统的平均方法相比，提高了捕获的呼吸信号的可靠性。我们证明了我们的系统在追踪鼻孔区域和在高动态范围场景中测量呼吸率的极端鲁棒性。
