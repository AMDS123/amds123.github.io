##### Abstract
With the rise of end-to-end learning through deep learning, person detectors and re-identification (ReID) models have recently become very strong. Multi-camera multi-target (MCMT) tracking has not fully gone through this transformation yet. We intend to take another step in this direction by presenting a theoretically principled way of integrating ReID with tracking formulated as an optimal Bayes filter. This conveniently side-steps the need for data-association and opens up a direct path from full images to the core of the tracker. While the results are still sub-par, we believe that this new, tight integration opens many interesting research opportunities and leads the way towards full end-to-end tracking from raw pixels.

随着深度学习的端到端学习的兴起，人类探测器和重新识别（ReID）模型最近变得非常强大。多摄像机多目标（MCMT）跟踪还没有完全通过这个转换。我们打算在这个方向上再次提出一个理论原则的方法来整合ReID跟踪，作为一个最优Bayes滤波器。这便于对数据关联的需求进行旁观并开辟了从完整图像到跟踪器核心的直接路径。虽然结果仍然不尽人意，但我们相信，这种新的紧密整合开启了许多有趣的研究机会，并引领了从原始像素到全面的端到端跟踪。
