##### Abstract
Overparameterized models that interpolate training data often display surprisingly good generalization properties. Specifically, minimum norm solutions have been shown to generalize well in the overparameterized, interpolating regime. This paper introduces a new framework for active learning based on the notion of minimum norm interpolators. We analytically study its properties and behavior in the kernel-based setting and present experimental studies with kernel methods and neural networks. In general, active learning algorithms adaptively select examples for labeling that (1) rule-out as many (incompatible) classifiers as possible at each step and/or (2) discover cluster structure in unlabeled data and label representative examples from each cluster. We show that our new active learning approach based on a minimum norm heuristic automatically exploits both these strategies.
