##### Abstract
New computer vision techniques, which enable accurate extraction of insights from videos, and the deployment of cameras en masse have made many previously inconceivable applications possible. Scaling video analytics to massive camera deployments, however, presents a tremendous challenge, as cost and resource consumption grow proportionally to the number of camera feeds. This paper is driven by a simple question: can we scale video analytics in such a way that cost grows sub-linearly (or even remains constant) as we deploy more cameras, while the accuracy of the analytics remains stable (or even improves)? We believe the answer is yes. Our key insight is that as cameras are densely installed in a physical space, their video feeds become increasingly correlated with each other, correlations that can be harnessed to improve the cost efficiency and accuracy of multi-camera video analytics. By explaining use-cases and technical challenges, we shed light on the potential of leveraging cross-camera correlations to scale out video analytics to many cameras, and call on the community to unlock this potential.

新的计算机视觉技术能够准确地从视频中提取洞察力，并且大规模地部署摄像机，这使得许多以前难以想象的应用成为可能。然而，将视频分析扩展到大规模的摄像机部署带来了巨大的挑战，因为成本和资源消耗与摄像机馈送的数量成比例增长。本文由一个简单的问题驱动：我们可以扩展视频分析，以便在我们部署更多摄像机时成本增长呈亚线性（甚至保持不变），同时分析的准确性保持稳定（甚至提高）？我们相信答案是肯定的。我们的主要观点是，由于摄像机密集安装在物理空间中，因此它们的视频输入变得越来越相互关联，可以利用相关性来提高多摄像机视频分析的成本效率和准确性。通过解释用例和技术挑战，我们阐明了利用跨摄像头相关性将视频分析扩展到许多摄像头的潜力，并呼吁社区释放这一潜力。
