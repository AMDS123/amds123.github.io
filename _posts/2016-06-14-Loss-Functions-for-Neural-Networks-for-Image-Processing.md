##### Abstract
Neural networks are becoming central in several areas of computer vision and image processing and different architectures have been proposed to solve specific problems. The impact of the loss layer of neural networks, however, has not received much attention in the context of image processing: the default and virtually only choice is L2. In this paper we bring attention to alternative choices. We study the performance of several losses, including perceptually-motivated losses, and propose a novel, differentiable error function. We show that the quality of the results improves significantly with better loss functions, even when the network architecture is left unchanged.

神经网络正在成为计算机视觉和图像处理的几个领域的核心，并且已经提出了不同的体系结构来解决具体的问题。然而，神经网络的损失层的影响在图像处理的情况下并没有得到太多的关注：默认的和实际上唯一的选择是L2。在本文中，我们将注意力放在替代选择上。我们研究了包括感知动机损失在内的多种损失的表现，并提出了一种新的，可区分的误差函数。我们表明，即使在网络架构保持不变的情况下，结果的质量也会随着更好的损失函数而显着提高。
