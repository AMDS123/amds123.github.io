##### Abstract
Aim: Early detection and correct diagnosis of lung cancer are the most important steps in improving patient outcome. This study aims to assess which deep learning models perform best in lung cancer diagnosis. Methods: Non-small cell lung carcinoma and small cell lung carcinoma biopsy specimens were consecutively obtained and stained. The specimen slides were diagnosed by two experienced pathologists (over 20 years). Several deep learning models were trained to discriminate cancer and non-cancer biopsies. Result: Deep learning models give reasonable AUC from 0.8810 to 0.9119. Conclusion: The deep learning analysis could help to speed up the detection process for the whole-slide image (WSI) and keep the comparable detection rate with human observer.

目的：肺癌的早期发现和正确诊断是改善患者预后的最重要步骤。本研究旨在评估哪些深度学习模型在肺癌诊断中表现最佳。方法：连续获得非小细胞肺癌和小细胞肺癌活检标本并染色。标本载玻片由两位有经验的病理学家（超过20年）诊断。培训了几种深度学习模式来区分癌症和非癌症活检。结果：深度学习模型给出合理的AUC从0.8810到0.9119。结论：深度学习分析有助于加快整个幻灯片图像（WSI）的检测过程，并保持与人类观察者相当的检测率。
