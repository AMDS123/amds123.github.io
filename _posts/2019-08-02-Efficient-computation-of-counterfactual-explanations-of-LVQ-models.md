##### Abstract
With the increasing use of machine learning in practice and because of legal regulations like EU's GDPR, it becomes indispensable to be able to explain the prediction and behavior of machine learning models. An example of easy to understand explanations of AI models are counterfactual explanations. However, for many models it is still an open research problem how to efficiently compute counterfactual explanations. 
 We investigate how to efficiently compute counterfactual explanations of learning vector quantization models. In particular, we propose different types of convex and non-convex programs depending on the used learning vector quantization model.
