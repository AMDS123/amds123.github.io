##### Abstract
Blind ptychography is the scanning version of coherent diffractive imaging which seeks to recover both the object and the probe are simultaneously. Concrete examples of ambiguity in blind ptychography are presented to illustrate the challenge of blind ptychography. Two opposing classes of measurement schemes are discussed: the mixing schemes and the raster scans. The former generally admit only a complex scaling factor and a linear phase ambiguity as ambiguities while the latter a host of other ambiguities of many degrees of freedom. 
 AMDRS is a reconstruction algorithm based on alternating minimization by Douglas-Rachford splitting. Enabled by an initialization method informed by the probe phase constraint in the theory of uniqueness, AMDRS converges globally and geometrically. The technique of bright-field boundary condition is introduced to remove the linear phase ambiguity and accelerate convergence, and the technique of adding salt noise is used to improve the quality of reconstruction of objects exhibiting extensive area of dark pixels.

##### Abstract (translated by Google)
盲ptychography是相干衍射成像的扫描版本，其寻求同时恢复物体和探针。提出了盲目心理学中模糊性的具体例子来说明盲目心理学的挑战。讨论了两类相反的测量方案：混合方案和光栅扫描。前者通常只允许复杂的比例因子和线性相位模糊度作为模糊性，而后者则存在许多其他自由度模糊性。
 AMDRS是一种基于Douglas-Rachford分裂交替最小化的重建算法。通过由唯一性理论中的探针相位约束提供的初始化方法启用，AMDRS在全局和几何上收敛。引入明场边界条件技术消除线性相位模糊，加速收敛，采用加盐噪声技术提高暗像素广泛区域物体的重建质量。
