##### Abstract
Microscopic pedestrian studies consider detailed interaction of pedestrians to control their movement in pedestrian traffic flow. The tools to collect the microscopic data and to analyze microscopic pedestrian flow are still very much in its infancy. The microscopic pedestrian flow characteristics need to be understood. Manual, semi manual and automatic image processing data collection systems were developed. It was found that the microscopic speed resemble a normal distribution with a mean of 1.38 m/second and standard deviation of 0.37 m/second. The acceleration distribution also bear a resemblance to the normal distribution with an average of 0.68 m/ square second. A physical based microscopic pedestrian simulation model was also developed. Both Microscopic Video Data Collection and Microscopic Pedestrian Simulation Model generate a database called NTXY database. The formulations of the flow performance or microscopic pedestrian characteristics are explained. Sensitivity of the simulation and relationship between the flow performances are described. Validation of the simulation using real world data is then explained through the comparison between average instantaneous speed distributions of the real world data with the result of the simulations. The simulation model is then applied for some experiments on a hypothetical situation to gain more understanding of pedestrian behavior in one way and two way situations, to know the behavior of the system if the number of elderly pedestrian increases and to evaluate a policy of lane-like segregation toward pedestrian crossing and inspects the performance of the crossing. It was revealed that the microscopic pedestrian studies have been successfully applied to give more understanding to the behavior of microscopic pedestrians flow, predict the theoretical and practical situation and evaluate some design policies before its implementation.

微观行人研究考虑行人的详细互动，以控制他们在行人交通流中的移动。收集微观数据和分析微观人流的工具仍处于初级阶段。微观的行人流量特征需要被理解。开发了手动，半手动和自动图像处理数据采集系统。发现微观速度类似于正态分布，平均值为1.38米/秒，标准差为0.37米/秒。加速度分布也与正态分布相似，平均为0.68米/平方秒。还开发了基于物理的微观行人模拟模型。微观视频数据采集和微观行人模拟模型都生成一个名为NTXY数据库的数据库。流动性能或微观行人特征的配方进行解释。描述了模拟的灵敏度和流动性能之间的关系。然后通过现实世界数据的平均瞬时速度分布与模拟结果之间的比较来解释使用真实世界数据验证仿真。然后将仿真模型应用于假设情况下的一些实验，以获得对单向和双向情况下行人行为的更多理解，了解老年行人数量增加时系统的行为，例如隔离人行横道，并检查过路口的表现。揭示了微观行人研究成功应用于微观行人流动行为的理解，预测理论与实践情况，并对一些设计政策进行实施前的评价。
