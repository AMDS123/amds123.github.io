##### Abstract
Effective and accurate diagnosis of Diabetes Mellitus (DM), as well as its early stage Impaired Glucose Regulation (IGR), has attracted much attention recently. Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) [3], [5] etc. has proved that tongue, face and sublingual diagnosis as a noninvasive method is a reasonable way for disease detection. However, most previous works only focus on a single modality (tongue, face or sublingual) for diagnosis, although different modalities may provide complementary information for the diagnosis of DM and IGR. In this paper, we propose a novel multi-modal classification method to discriminate between DM (or IGR) and healthy controls. Specially, the tongue, facial and sublingual images are first collected by using a non-invasive capture device. The color, texture and geometry features of these three types of images are then extracted, respectively. Finally, our so-called multi-modal similar and specific learning (MMSSL) approach is proposed to combine features of tongue, face and sublingual, which not only exploits the correlation but also extracts individual components among them. Experimental results on a dataset consisting of 192 Healthy, 198 DM and 114 IGR samples (all samples were obtained from Guangdong Provincial Hospital of Traditional Chinese Medicine) substantiate the effectiveness and superiority of our proposed method for the diagnosis of DM and IGR, compared to the case of using a single modality.

糖尿病（DM）及其早期葡萄糖调节受损（IGR）的有效准确诊断近年来备受关注。传统中医药[3]，[5]等已经证明舌面，舌下诊断是一种非侵入性方法，是一种合理的疾病检测方法。然而，大多数以前的研究只关注单一的诊断方式（舌头，面部或舌下），尽管不同的方式可能为DM和IGR的诊断提供补充信息。在本文中，我们提出了一种新的多模态分类方法来区分DM（或IGR）和健康对照。特别地，舌头，面部和舌下图像首先通过使用非侵入式捕捉设备来收集。然后分别提取这三种图像的颜色，纹理和几何特征。最后，提出了将舌，脸和舌下特征相结合的所谓多模态相似和特定学习（MMSSL）方法，它不仅利用了相关性，而且还提取了其中的个体成分。由192个健康，198个DM和114个IGR样品（所有样品均来自广东省中医院）组成的数据集的实验结果证实了我们提出的用于诊断DM和IGR的方法的有效性和优越性，使用单一模式的情况。
