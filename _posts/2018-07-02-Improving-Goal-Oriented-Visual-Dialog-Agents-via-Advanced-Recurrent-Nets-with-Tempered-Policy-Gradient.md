##### Abstract
Learning goal-oriented dialogues by means of deep reinforcement learning has recently become a popular research topic. However, training text-generating agents efficiently is still a considerable challenge. Commonly used policy-based dialogue agents often end up focusing on simple utterances and suboptimal policies. To mitigate this problem, we propose a class of novel temperature-based extensions for policy gradient methods, which are referred to as Tempered Policy Gradients (TPGs). These methods encourage exploration with different temperature control strategies. We derive three variations of the TPGs and show their superior performance on a recently published AI-testbed, i.e., the GuessWhat?! game. On the testbed, we achieve significant improvements with two innovations. The first one is an extension of the state-of-the-art solutions with Seq2Seq and Memory Network structures that leads to an improvement of 9%. The second one is the application of our newly developed TPG methods, which improves the performance additionally by around 5% and, even more importantly, helps produce more convincing utterances. TPG can easily be applied to any goal-oriented dialogue systems.

通过深度强化学习来学习面向目标的对话最近成为一个热门的研究课题。但是，有效地培训文本生成代理仍然是一个相当大的挑战。常用的基于政策的对话代理人往往最终关注的是简单的话语和次优的政策。为了缓解这个问题，我们为策略梯度方法提出了一类新的基于温度的扩展，称为Tempered Policy Gradients（TPG）。这些方法鼓励采用不同的温控策略进行探索。我们得出了TPG的三种变体，并在最近发布的AI测试平台上展示了​​它们的优越性能，即GuessWhat ?!游戏。在测试平台上，我们通过两项创新实现了显着的改进。第一个是使用Seq2Seq和存储网络结构的最先进解决方案的扩展，导致9％的改进。第二个是我们新开发的TPG方法的应用，它将性能提高了约5％，更重要的是，有助于产生更有说服力的话语。 TPG可以轻松应用于任何面向目标的对话系统。
