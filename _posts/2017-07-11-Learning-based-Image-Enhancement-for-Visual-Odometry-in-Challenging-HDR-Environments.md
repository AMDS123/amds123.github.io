##### Abstract
Most approaches to stereo visual odometry reconstruct the motion based on the tracking of point features along a sequence of images. However, in low-textured scenes it is often difficult to encounter a large set of point features, or it may happen that they are not well distributed over the image, so that the behavior of these algorithms deteriorates. This paper proposes a probabilistic approach to stereo visual odometry based on the combination of both point and line segment that works robustly in a wide variety of scenarios. The camera motion is recovered through non-linear minimization of the projection errors of both point and line segment features. In order to effectively combine both types of features, their associated errors are weighted according to their covariance matrices, computed from the propagation of Gaussian distribution errors in the sensor measurements. The method, of course, is computationally more expensive that using only one type of feature, but still can run in real-time on a standard computer and provides interesting advantages, including a straightforward integration into any probabilistic framework commonly employed in mobile robotics.

大多数立体视觉测距方法基于沿着图像序列的点特征的跟踪来重建运动。然而，在低纹理的场景中，经常难以遇到大量的点特征，或者可能发生它们不能很好地分布在图像上，使得这些算法的行为恶化。本文提出了一种立体视觉测距的概率方法，基于点和线段的组合，在各种场景下都能够稳健地工作。通过非线性最小化点和线段特征的投影误差来恢复摄像机运动。为了有效地结合这两种类型的特征，根据它们的协方差矩阵对它们相关的误差进行加权，从传感器测量中的高斯分布误差的传播计算。当然，该方法在计算上更昂贵，仅使用一种类型的特征，但仍然可以在标准计算机上实时运行，并提供有趣的优点，包括直接集成到通常用于移动机器人的概率框架中。
