##### Abstract
We proposed a kind of naturally combined shape-color affine moment invariants (SCAMI), which consider both shape and color affine transformations simultaneously in one single system. In the real scene, color and shape deformations always exist in images simultaneously. Simple shape invariants or color invariants can not be qualified for this situation. The conventional method is just to make a simple linear combination of the two factors. Meanwhile, the manual selection of weights is a complex issue. Our construction method is based on the multiple integration framework. The integral kernel is assigned as the continued product of the shape and color invariant cores. It is the first time to directly derive an invariant to dual affine transformations of shape and color. The manual selection of weights is no longer necessary, and both the shape and color transformations are extended to affine transformation group. With the various of invariant cores, a set of lower-order invariants are constructed and the completeness and independence are discussed detailedly. A set of SCAMIs, which called SCAMI24, are recommended, and the effectiveness and robustness have been evaluated on both synthetic and real datasets.

我们提出了一种自然结合的形状色仿射矩不变量（SCAMI），它在一个单一的系统中同时考虑形状和颜色的仿射变换。在真实场景中，颜色和形状变形总是同时存在于图像中。简单的形状不变量或颜色不变量不能满足这种情况。传统的方法只是对这两个因素进行简单的线性组合。同时，手动选择权重是一个复杂的问题。我们的构建方法基于多重集成框架。积分内核被分配为形状和颜色不变核心的连续积。直接推导形状和颜色的双仿射变换不变量。不再需要手动选择权重，而且形状和颜色转换都扩展到仿射变换组。利用各种不变核，构造了一组低阶不变量，详细讨论了其完备性和独立性。推荐使用一组名为SCAMI24的SCAMI，并在合成和实际数据集上评估其有效性和鲁棒性。
