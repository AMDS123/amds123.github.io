##### Abstract
The unsupervised classification has a very important role in the analysis of multispectral images, given its ability to assist the extraction of a priori knowledge of images. Algorithms like k-means and fuzzy c-means has long been used in this task. Computational Intelligence has proven to be an important field to assist in building classifiers optimized according to the quality of the grouping of classes and the evaluation of the quality of vector quantization. Several studies have shown that Philosophy, especially the Dialectical Method, has served as an important inspiration for the construction of new computational methods. This paper presents an evaluation of four methods based on the Dialectics: the Objective Dialectical Classifier and the Dialectical Optimization Method adapted to build a version of k-means with optimal quality indices; each of them is presented in two versions: a canonical version and another version obtained by applying the Principle of Maximum Entropy. These methods were compared to k-means, fuzzy c-means and Kohonen's self-organizing maps. The results showed that the methods based on Dialectics are robust to noise, and quantization can achieve results as good as those obtained with the Kohonen map, considered an optimal quantizer.

无监督分类在多光谱图像分析中具有非常重要的作用，因为它能够协助提取图像的先验知识。像k-means和模糊c-means这样的算法早就用于这个任务。计算智能已经被证明是一个重要的领域，可以帮助建立根据类别分组质量和矢量量化质量评估优化的分类器。一些研究表明，哲学，尤其是辩证方法，已经成为构建新的计算方法的重要灵感。本文提出了一种基于辩证法的四种方法的评价：客观辩证法分类器和辩证优化法适用于构建具有最优质量指标的k-均值版本;每个版本都有两个版本：一个是规范版本，另一个是应用最大熵原理获得的版本。将这些方法与k均值，模糊c均值和Kohonen的自组织映射进行比较。结果表明，基于辩证法的方法对噪声有较强的鲁棒性，量化结果与Kohonen映射得到的结果一致，被认为是最优的量化器。
