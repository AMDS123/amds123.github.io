##### Abstract
We introduce an accurate lung segmentation model for chest radiographs based on deep convolutional neural networks. Our model is based on atrous convolutional layers to increase the field-of-view of filters efficiently. To improve segmentation performances further, we also propose a multi-stage training strategy, network-wise training, which the current stage network is fed with both input images and the outputs from pre-stage network. It is shown that this strategy has an ability to reduce falsely predicted labels and produce smooth boundaries of lung fields. We evaluate the proposed model on a common benchmark dataset, JSRT, and achieve the state-of-the-art segmentation performances with much fewer model parameters.

我们基于深度卷积神经网络为胸部X光片引入了一个准确的肺部分割模型。我们的模型基于有害的卷积层来有效地增加滤波器的视场。为了进一步提高分割性能，我们还提出了一个多阶段训练策略，即网络训练，当前阶段网络同时输入输入图像和前期网络输出。结果表明，该策略有能力减少错误预测的标签，并产生肺部平滑的边界。我们在通用基准数据集JSRT上评估所提出的模型，并用更少的模型参数实现最先进的分割性能。
