##### Abstract
Inspired by the recent successes of deep learning on Computer Vision and Natural Language Processing, we present a deep learning approach for recognizing scanned receipts. The recognition system has two main modules: text detection based on Connectionist Text Proposal Network and text recognition based on Attention-based Encoder-Decoder. We also proposed pre-processing to extract receipt area and OCR verification to ignore handwriting. The experiments on the dataset of the Robust Reading Challenge on Scanned Receipts OCR and Information Extraction 2019 demonstrate that the accuracies were improved by integrating the pre-processing and the OCR verification. Our recognition system achieved 71.9% of the F1 score for detection and recognition task.
