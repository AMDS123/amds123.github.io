##### Abstract
For convolutional neural networks, a simple algorithm to reduce off-chip memory accesses is proposed by maximally utilizing on-chip memory in a neural process unit. Especially, the algorithm provides an effective way to process a module which consists of multiple branches and a merge layer. For Inception-V3 on Samsung's NPU in Exynos, our evaluation shows that the proposed algorithm makes off-chip memory accesses reduced by 1/50, and accordingly achieves 97.59 % reduction in the amount of feature-map data to be transferred from/to off-chip memory.
