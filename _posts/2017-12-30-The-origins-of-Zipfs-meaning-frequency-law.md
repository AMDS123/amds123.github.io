##### Abstract
In his pioneering research, G. K. Zipf observed that more frequent words tend to have more meanings, and showed that the number of meanings of a word grows as the square root of its frequency. He derived this relationship from two assumptions: that words follow Zipf's law for word frequencies (a power law dependency between frequency and rank) and Zipf's law of meaning distribution (a power law dependency between number of meanings and rank). Here we show that a single assumption on the joint probability of a word and a meaning suffices to infer Zipf's meaning-frequency law or relaxed versions. Interestingly, this assumption can be justified as the outcome of a biased random walk in the process of mental exploration.

G.K.Zipf在他的开创性研究中观察到，更频繁的词语往往具有更多的含义，并且表明单词的含义数量随着其频率的平方根而增长。他从两个假设推导出这种关系：词语遵循Zipf定律的词频（频率和秩次之间的幂律依赖）和Zipf的意义分布定律（意义数量和秩次之间的幂律依赖）。在这里我们表明，关于一个词和一个意义的联合概率的单一假设足以推断Zipf的意义频率定律或轻松版本。有趣的是，这个假设可以被证明是在心理探索过程中有偏差随机行走的结果。
