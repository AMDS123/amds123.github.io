##### Abstract
Collecting fully annotated image datasets is challenging and expensive. Many types of weak supervision have been explored: weak manual annotations, web search results, temporal continuity, ambient sound and others. We focus on one particular unexplored mode: visual questions that are asked about images. The key observation that inspires our work is that the question itself provides useful information about the image (even without the answer being available). For instance, the question "what is the breed of the dog?" informs the AI that the animal in the scene is a dog and that there is only one dog present. We make three contributions: (1) providing an extensive qualitative and quantitative analysis of the information contained in human visual questions, (2) proposing two simple but surprisingly effective modifications to the standard visual question answering models that allow them to make use of weak supervision in the form of unanswered questions associated with images and (3) demonstrating that a simple data augmentation strategy inspired by our insights results in a 7.1% improvement on the standard VQA benchmark.

收集完全注释的图像数据集是具有挑战性和昂贵的。已经探索了许多类型的弱监督：弱手工注释，网页搜索结果，时间连续性，环境声音等。我们专注于一个特定的未开发模式：被问及图像的视觉问题。激发我们工作的关键观察是，问题本身提供了有关图像的有用信息（即使没有可用的答案）。例如，“什么是狗的品种？”通知AI，现场的动物是一只狗，只有一只狗在场。我们做出三个贡献：（1）对人类视觉问题中所包含的信息进行广泛的定性和定量分析;（2）对标准视觉问答模型提出两个简单但令人惊讶的有效修改，使他们能够利用弱监督以与图像相关的未解答的问题的形式，以及（3）表明由我们的洞察力启发的简单的数据增强策略导致标准VQA基准改进了7.1％。
