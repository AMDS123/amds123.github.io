##### Abstract
We have studied the high-frequency properties of the non-equilibrium electron gas in GaN samples subjected to electric and magnetic fields. Spectra of the complex tensor of the dynamical mobility have been calculated for THz frequency range. For the compensated GaN and low temperatures, in the intervals of electric fields of the few $kV/cm$ and magnetic fields of the few $T$ the existence of the cyclotron and optical phonon transit-time resonances has been identified. We have shown that interplay of two resonances gives rise to specific spectra of THz transmission and absorption (or gain). We suggest that experimental investigation of these effects will facilitate elaboration of field controlled devices for THz optoelectronics.
