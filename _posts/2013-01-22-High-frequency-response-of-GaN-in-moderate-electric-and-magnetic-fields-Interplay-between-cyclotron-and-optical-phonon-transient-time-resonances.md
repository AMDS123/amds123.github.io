##### Abstract
We have studied the high-frequency properties of the non-equilibrium electron gas in GaN samples subjected to electric and magnetic fields. Spectra of the complex tensor of the dynamical mobility have been calculated for THz frequency range. For the compensated GaN and low temperatures, in the intervals of electric fields of the few $kV/cm$ and magnetic fields of the few $T$ the existence of the cyclotron and optical phonon transit-time resonances has been identified. We have shown that interplay of two resonances gives rise to specific spectra of THz transmission and absorption (or gain). We suggest that experimental investigation of these effects will facilitate elaboration of field controlled devices for THz optoelectronics.

我们已经研究了在电场和磁场作用下的GaN样品中非平衡电子气的高频特性。已经计算了太赫兹频率范围内的动态迁移率的复张量的谱。对于补偿的GaN和低温，在$ kV / cm $几千电场的区间和几个T $的磁场的区间内，已经确定了回旋加速器和光学声子渡越时间共振的存在。我们已经表明，两个共振的相互作用产生了THz透射和吸收（或增益）的特定光谱。我们建议对这些效应的实验研究将有助于阐述太赫兹光电子的现场控制器件。
