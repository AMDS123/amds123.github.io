##### Abstract
In this paper, we propose a novel algorithm to rectify illumination of the digitized documents by eliminating shading artifacts. Firstly, a topographic surface of an input digitized document is created using luminance value of each pixel. Then the shading artifact on the document is estimated by simulating an immersion process. The simulation of the immersion process is modeled using a novel diffusion equation with an iterative update rule. After estimating the shading artifacts, the digitized document is reconstructed using the Lambertian surface model. In order to evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithm, we conduct rigorous experiments on a set of digitized documents which is generated using smartphones under challenging lighting conditions. According to the experimental results, it is found that the proposed method produces promising illumination correction results and outperforms the results of the state-of-the-art methods.
