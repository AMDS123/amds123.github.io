##### Abstract
Craters are among the most studied geomorphic features in the Solar System because they yield important information about the past and present geological processes and provide information about the relative ages of observed geologic formations. We present a method for automatic crater detection using advanced machine learning to deal with the large amount of satellite imagery collected. The challenge of automatically detecting craters comes from their is complex surface because their shape erodes over time to blend into the surface. Bandeira provided a seminal dataset that embodied this challenge that is still an unsolved pattern recognition problem to this day. There has been work to solve this challenge based on extracting shape and contrast features and then applying classification models on those features. The limiting factor in this existing work is the use of hand crafted filters on the image such as Gabor or Sobel filters or Haar features. These hand crafted methods rely on domain knowledge to construct. We would like to learn the optimal filters and features based on training examples. In order to dynamically learn filters and features we look to Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) which have shown their dominance in computer vision. The power of CNNs is that they can learn image filters which generate features for high accuracy classification.

火山口是太阳系中研究最多的地貌特征之一，因为它们产生了关于过去和现在的地质过程的重要信息，并提供了有关观测到的地质构造的相对年龄的信息。我们提出了一种使用高级机器学习来处理收集的大量卫星图像的自动火山口检测方法。自动检测陨石坑的挑战来自它们的复杂表面，因为它们的形状会随着时间的推移而受到侵蚀而融入表面。 Bandeira提供了一个重要的数据集，体现了这个挑战，至今仍是一个未解决的模式识别问题。基于提取形状和对比度特征，然后对这些特征应用分类模型，已经有工作去解决这个挑战。现有工作中的限制因素是在图像上使用手工制作的滤镜，如Gabor或Sobel滤镜或Haar特征。这些手工制作的方法依靠领域知识来构建。我们想学习基于训练样例的最优滤波器和特征。为了动态地学习滤波器和特征，我们期待卷积神经网络（CNN）在计算机视觉领域占据主导地位。 CNN的威力在于他们可以学习生成高精度分类特征的图像滤波器。
