##### Abstract
Image segmentation of touching objects plays a key role in providing accurate classification for computer vision technologies. A new line profile based imaging segmentation algorithm has been developed to provide a robust and accurate segmentation of a group of touching corns. The performance of the line profile based algorithm has been compared to a watershed based imaging segmentation algorithm. Both algorithms are tested on three different patterns of images, which are isolated corns, single-lines, and random distributed formations. The experimental results show that the algorithm can segment a large number of touching corn kernels efficiently and accurately.

触摸物体的图像分割在为计算机视觉技术提供精确分类方面起着关键作用。已经开发了一种新的基于线轮廓的成像分割算法，以提供对一组接触式玉米的健壮和精确的分割。基于线轮廓的算法的性能已经与基于分水岭的成像分割算法进行比较。这两种算法都是在三种不同的图像上进行测试的，这些图像是孤立的玉米，单线和随机分布的地层。实验结果表明，该算法能够高效，准确地分割出大量的玉米接触颗粒。
