##### Abstract
When, in addition to stability, position synchronization is also desired in bilateral teleoperation, Time Domain Passivity Approach (TDPA) alone might not be able to fulfill the desired objective. This is due to an undesired effect caused by admittance type passivity controllers, namely position drift. Previous works focused on developing TDPA-based drift compensation methods to solve this issue. It was shown that, in addition to reducing drift, one of the proposed methods was able to keep the force signals within their normal range, guaranteeing the safety of the task. However, no multi-DoF treatment of those approaches has been addressed. In that scope, this paper focuses on providing an extension of previous TDPA-based approaches to multi-DoF Cartesian-space teleoperation. An analysis of the convergence properties of the presented method is also provided. In addition, its applicability to multi-DoF devices is shown through hardware experiments and numerical simulation with round-trip time delays up to 700 ms.
