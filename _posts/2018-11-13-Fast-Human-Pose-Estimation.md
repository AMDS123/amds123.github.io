##### Abstract
Existing human pose estimation approaches often only consider how to improve the model generalisation performance, but putting aside the significant efficiency problem. This leads to the development of heavy models with poor scalability and cost-effectiveness in practical use. In this work, we investigate the under-studied but practically critical pose model efficiency problem. To this end, we present a new Fast Pose Distillation (FPD) model learning strategy. Specifically, the FPD trains a lightweight pose neural network architecture capable of executing rapidly with low computational cost by effectively transferring the pose structure knowledge of a strong teacher. Extensive evaluations demonstrate the advantages of our FPD method over a broad range of state-of-the-art pose estimation approaches in terms of model cost-effectiveness on the standard benchmark datasets, MPII Human Pose and Leeds Sports Pose.
