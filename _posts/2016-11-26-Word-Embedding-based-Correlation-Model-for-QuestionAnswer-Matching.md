##### Abstract
With the development of community based question answering (Q&A) services, a large scale of Q&A archives have been accumulated and are an important information and knowledge resource on the web. Question and answer matching has been attached much importance to for its ability to reuse knowledge stored in these systems: it can be useful in enhancing user experience with recurrent questions. In this paper, we try to improve the matching accuracy by overcoming the lexical gap between question and answer pairs. A Word Embedding based Correlation (WEC) model is proposed by integrating advantages of both the translation model and word embedding, given a random pair of words, WEC can score their co-occurrence probability in Q&A pairs and it can also leverage the continuity and smoothness of continuous space word representation to deal with new pairs of words that are rare in the training parallel text. An experimental study on Yahoo! Answers dataset and Baidu Zhidao dataset shows this new method's promising potential.

随着社区问答（Q＆A）服务的发展，大量的问答档案已经积累起来，成为网络上的重要信息和知识资源。问题和答案的匹配已经非常重视其重用存储在这些系统中的知识的能力：它可以有助于提高用户对经常性问题的体验。在本文中，我们试图通过克服问答对之间的词汇鸿沟来提高匹配的准确性。基于WEC模型，结合翻译模型和词嵌入的优点，给出了一个随机的词对，WEC可以在Q＆A对中得到其共现概率，并且可以利用连续性和平滑性的连续空间词表示来处理训练并行文本中罕见的新对词。雅虎实验研究Answers数据集和百度知道数据集显示了这种新方法的潜力。
