##### Abstract
Axions are well motivated particles that could make up most or all of the dark matter if they have masses below 100 $\mu$eV. Microwave cavity techniques comprised of closed resonant structures immersed in solenoid magnets are sensitive to dark matter axions with masses of a few $\mu$eV, but face difficulties scaling to higher masses. We present the a novel detector architecture consisting of an open, Fabry-PÃ©rot resonator and a series of current-carrying wire planes, and demonstrate this technique with a search for dark matter axion-like particles called Orpheus. This search excludes dark matter axion-like particles with masses between 68.2 and 76.5 $\mu$eV and axion-photon couplings greater than $4\times10^{-7} \mathrm{GeV}^{-1}$. We project that the fundamental sensitivity of this technique could be extended to be sensitive to couplings below $1\times10^{-15} \mathrm{GeV}^{-1}$, consistent with the DFSZ model of QCD axions.
