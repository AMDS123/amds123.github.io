##### Abstract
Shared Mobility-on-Demand using automated vehicles can reduce energy consumption and cost for future mobility. However, its full potential in energy saving has not been fully explored. An algorithm to minimize fleet fuel consumption while satisfying customers travel time constraints is developed in this paper. Numerical simulations with realistic travel demand and route choice are performed, showing that if fuel consumption is not considered, the MOD service can increase fleet fuel consumption due to increased empty vehicle mileage. With fuel consumption as part of the cost function, we can reduce total fuel consumption by 12 percent while maintaining a high level of mobility service.
