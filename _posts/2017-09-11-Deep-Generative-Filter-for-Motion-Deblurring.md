##### Abstract
Removing blur caused by camera shake in images has always been a challenging problem in computer vision literature due to its ill-posed nature. Motion blur caused due to the relative motion between the camera and the object in 3D space induces a spatially varying blurring effect over the entire image. In this paper, we propose a novel deep filter based on Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) architecture integrated with global skip connection and dense architecture in order to tackle this problem. Our model, while bypassing the process of blur kernel estimation, significantly reduces the test time which is necessary for practical applications. The experiments on the benchmark datasets prove the effectiveness of the proposed method which outperforms the state-of-the-art blind deblurring algorithms both quantitatively and qualitatively.

在计算机视觉文献中，由于其不适当的性质，一直以来都是在图像中去除相机晃动造成的模糊。由于相机与三维空间中的物体之间的相对运动而引起的运动模糊在整个图像上引起空间变化的模糊效应。为了解决这个问题，本文提出了一种基于生成对抗网络（GAN）架构的新型深度过滤器，集成了全局跳跃连接和密集架构。我们的模型虽然绕过了模糊核估计的过程，但却大大缩短了实际应用所需的测试时间。基准数据集上的实验证明了所提出的方法在数量和质量上均优于现有技术的盲去模糊算法的有效性。
