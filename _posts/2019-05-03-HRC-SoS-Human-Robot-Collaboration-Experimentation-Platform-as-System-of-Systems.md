##### Abstract
This paper presents an experimentation platform for human robot collaboration as a system of systems as well as proposes a conceptual framework describing the aspects of Human Robot Collaboration. These aspects are Awareness, Intelligence and Compliance of the system. Based on this framework case studies describing experiment setups performed using this platform are discussed. Each experiment highlights the use of the subsystems such as the digital twin, motion capture system, human-physiological monitoring system, data collection system and robot control and interface systems. A highlight of this paper showcases a subsystem with the ability to monitor human physiological feedback during a human robot collaboration task.
