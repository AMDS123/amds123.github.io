##### Abstract
Rankings, representing preferences over a set of candidates, are widely used in many information systems, e.g., group decision making. It is of great importance to evaluate the consensus of the obtained rankings from multiple agents. There is often no ground truth available for a ranking task. An overall measure of the consensus degree enables us to have a clear cognition about the ranking data. Moreover, it could provide a quantitative indicator for consensus comparison between groups and further improvement of a ranking system. In this paper, a novel consensus quantifying approach, without the need for any correlation or distance functions, is proposed based on a concept of q-support patterns of rankings. The q-support patterns represent the commonality embedded in a set of rankings. A method for detecting outliers in a set of rankings is naturally derived from the proposed consensus quantifying approach. Experimental studies are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.
