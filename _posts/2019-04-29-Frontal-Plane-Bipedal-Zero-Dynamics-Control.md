##### Abstract
In bipedal gait design literature, one of the common ways of generating stable 3D walking gait is by designing the frontal and sagittal controllers as decoupled dynamics. The study of the decoupled frontal dynamics is, however, still understudied if compared with the sagittal dynamics. In this paper it is presented a formal approach to the problem of frontal dynamics stabilization by extending the hybrid zero dynamics framework to deal with the frontal gait design problem.
