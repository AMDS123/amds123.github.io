##### Abstract
We propose a novel 3D segmentation method for RBGD stream data to deal with 3D object segmentation task in a generic scenario with frequent object interactions. It mainly contributes in two aspects, while being generic and not requiring initialization: firstly, a novel tree structure representation for the point cloud of the scene is proposed. Then, a dynamic manangement mechanism for connected component splits and merges exploits the tree structure representation.
