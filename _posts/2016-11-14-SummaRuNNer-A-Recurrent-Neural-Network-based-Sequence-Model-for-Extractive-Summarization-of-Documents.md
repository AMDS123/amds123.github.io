##### Abstract
We present SummaRuNNer, a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) based sequence model for extractive summarization of documents and show that it achieves performance better than or comparable to state-of-the-art. Our model has the additional advantage of being very interpretable, since it allows visualization of its predictions broken up by abstract features such as information content, salience and novelty. Another novel contribution of our work is abstractive training of our extractive model that can train on human generated reference summaries alone, eliminating the need for sentence-level extractive labels.

##### Abstract (translated by Google)
我们提出SummaRuNNer，一个基于循环神经网络（RNN）的序列模型，用于文档的抽取汇总，并显示其性能优于或与最先进的技术相比。我们的模型还有另外一个优点，就是可以很好地解释，因为它可以通过抽象的特征，比如信息内容，显着性和新颖性来分析预测的可视化。我们工作的另一个新颖贡献是我们的抽取模型的抽象训练，可以单独训练人类生成的参考摘要，消除了对句子级抽取标签的需求。
