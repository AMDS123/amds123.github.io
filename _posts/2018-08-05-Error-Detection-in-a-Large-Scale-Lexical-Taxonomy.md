##### Abstract
Knowledge base (KB) is an important aspect in artificial intelligence. One significant challenge faced by KB construction is that it contains many noises, which prevents its effective usage. Even though some KB cleansing algorithms have been proposed, they focus on the structure of the knowledge graph and neglect the relation between the concepts, which could be helpful to discover wrong relations in KB. Motived by this, we measure the relation of two concepts by the distance between their corresponding instances and detect errors within the intersection of the conflicting concept sets. For efficient and effective knowledge base cleansing, we first apply a distance-based Model to determine the conflicting concept sets using two different methods. Then, we propose and analyze several algorithms on how to detect and repairing the errors based on our model, where we use hash method for an efficient way to calculate distance. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approaches could cleanse the knowledge bases efficiently and effectively.

知识库（KB）是人工智能的一个重要方面。 KB构造面临的一个重大挑战是它包含许多噪音，这会阻碍其有效使用。尽管已经提出了一些KB清理算法，但它们关注知识图的结构并忽略了概念之间的关系，这可能有助于发现KB中的错误关系。由此推动，我们通过它们相应实例之间的距离来测量两个概念的关系，并在冲突概念集的交叉点内检测错误。为了高效和有效地进行知识库清理，我们首先应用基于距离的模型来使用两种不同的方法来确定冲突的概念集。然后，我们基于我们的模型提出并分析了几种关于如何检测和修复错误的算法，其中我们使用哈希方法来有效地计算距离。实验结果表明，所提出的方法可以有效地清理知识库。
