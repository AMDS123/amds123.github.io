##### Abstract
This manuscript describes the elements of a theory of information tailored to control and decision tasks and specifically to visual data. The concept of Actionable Information is described, that relates to a notion of information championed by J. Gibson, and a notion of "complete information" that relates to the minimal sufficient statistics of a complete representation. It is shown that the "actionable information gap" between the two can be reduced by exercising control on the sensing process. Thus, senging, control and information are inextricably tied. This has consequences in the so-called "signal-to-symbol barrier" problem, as well as in the analysis and design of active sensing systems. It has ramifications in vision-based control, navigation, 3-D reconstruction and rendering, as well as detection, localization, recognition and categorization of objects and scenes in live video. 
 This manuscript has been developed from a set of lecture notes for a summer course at the First International Computer Vision Summer School (ICVSS) in Scicli, Italy, in July of 2008. They were later expanded and amended for subsequent lectures in the same School in July 2009. Starting on November 1, 2009, they were further expanded for a special topics course, CS269, taught at UCLA in the Spring term of 2010.

本手稿描述了为控制和决策任务量身定制的信息理论元素，特别是视觉数据。描述了可操作信息的概念，涉及J. Gibson所倡导的信息概念，以及与完整代表的最小充分统计相关的“完整信息”的概念。结果表明，通过对传感过程进行控制，可以减少两者之间的“可操作的信息差距”。因此，排序，控制和信息是密不可分的。这在所谓的“信号到符号障碍”问题以及有源传感系统的分析和设计中都有影响。它在基于视觉的控制，导航，三维重建和渲染以及实时视频中的对象和场景的检测，定位，识别和分类方面具有分歧。
 本手稿是在2008年7月在意大利希克利的第一届国际计算机视觉暑期学校（ICVSS）举办的夏季课程讲义中发展起来的。之后他们在同一所学校的后续讲座中进行了扩展和修订。 2009年7月。自2009年11月1日起，他们进一步扩展为2010年春季在加州大学洛杉矶分校授课的专题课程CS269。
