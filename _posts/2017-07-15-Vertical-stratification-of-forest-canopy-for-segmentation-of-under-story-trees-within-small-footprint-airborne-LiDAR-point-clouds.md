##### Abstract
Airborne LiDAR point cloud representing a forest contains 3D data, from which vertical stand structure even of understory layers can be derived. This paper presents a tree segmentation approach for multi-story stands that stratifies the point cloud to canopy layers and segments individual tree crowns within each layer using a digital surface model based tree segmentation method. The novelty of the approach is the stratification procedure that separates the point cloud to an overstory and multiple understory tree canopy layers by analyzing vertical distributions of LiDAR points within overlapping locales. The procedure does not make a priori assumptions about the shape and size of the tree crowns and can, independent of the tree segmentation method, be utilized to vertically stratify tree crowns of forest canopies. We applied the proposed approach to the University of Kentucky Robinson Forest - a natural deciduous forest with complex and highly variable terrain and vegetation structure. The segmentation results showed that using the stratification procedure strongly improved detecting understory trees (from 46% to 68%) at the cost of introducing a fair number of over-segmented understory trees (increased from 1% to 16%), while barely affecting the overall segmentation quality of overstory trees. Results of vertical stratification of the canopy showed that the point density of understory canopy layers were suboptimal for performing a reasonable tree segmentation, suggesting that acquiring denser LiDAR point clouds would allow more improvements in segmenting understory trees. As shown by inspecting correlations of the results with forest structure, the segmentation approach is applicable to a variety of forest types.

代表森林的机载LiDAR点云包含3D数据，甚至可以从中得到垂直层站结构。本文提出了一个多层次的树状分割方法，使用基于数字表面模型的树状分割方法，将点云层化为树冠层，并对每层内的单个树冠进行分割。该方法的新颖之处在于通过分析重叠区域内的LiDAR点的垂直分布，将点云分成多层和多层下层树冠层的分层过程。该程序不会对树冠的形状和大小做出先验假设，并且可以独立于树分割方法来利用树冠的树冠垂直分层。我们将所提出的方法应用于肯塔基大学罗宾逊森林 - 这是一个自然落叶林，地形和植被结构复杂多变。分割结果表明，以引入相当数量的过度分割的林下树木（从1％增加到16％）为代价，使用分层过程极大地改进了检测林下树木（从46％到68％），而几乎不影响整体树冠分割质量。冠层垂直分层的结果表明，林下冠层的点密度对于进行合理的树分割是不理想的，这表明获得更密集的LiDAR点云将允许在分割林下树方面进行更多的改进。通过检测森林结构与森林结构的相关性可以看出，分割方法适用于多种森林类型。
