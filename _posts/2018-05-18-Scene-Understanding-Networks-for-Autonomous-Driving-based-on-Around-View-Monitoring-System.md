##### Abstract
Modern driver assistance systems rely on a wide range of sensors (RADAR, LIDAR, ultrasound and cameras) for scene understanding and prediction. These sensors are typically used for detecting traffic participants and scene elements required for navigation. In this paper we argue that relying on camera based systems, specifically Around View Monitoring (AVM) system has great potential to achieve these goals in both parking and driving modes with decreased costs. The contributions of this paper are as follows: we present a new end-to-end solution for delimiting the safe drivable area for each frame by means of identifying the closest obstacle in each direction from the driving vehicle, we use this approach to calculate the distance to the nearest obstacles and we incorporate it into a unified end-to-end architecture capable of joint object detection, curb detection and safe drivable area detection. Furthermore, we describe the family of networks for both a high accuracy solution and a low complexity solution. We also introduce further augmentation of the base architecture with 3D object detection.

现代驾驶辅助系统依靠各种传感器（雷达，激光雷达，超声波和相机）进行场景理解和预测。这些传感器通常用于检测交通参与者和导航所需的场景元素。在本文中，我们认为依靠基于摄像机的系统，特别是全景视图监控（AVM）系统，在停车和驾驶模式下实现这些目标的潜力巨大，成本下降。本文的贡献如下：我们提出了一种新的端到端解决方案，通过从驾驶车辆识别每个方向上最近的障碍物，为每个框架划定安全驾驶区域，我们使用这种方法来计算距离最近的障碍物，我们将其整合到一个统一的端到端架构中，能够进行联合对象检测，路缘检测和安全驾驶区域检测。此外，我们描述了高精度解决方案和低复杂度解决方案的网络系列。我们还介绍了使用3D对象检测进一步增强基础架构。
