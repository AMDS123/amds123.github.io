##### Abstract
This paper presents a novel approach for enhancing the multiple sets of acoustic patterns automatically discovered from a given corpus. In a previous work it was proposed that different HMM configurations (number of states per model, number of distinct models) for the acoustic patterns form a two-dimensional space. Multiple sets of acoustic patterns automatically discovered with the HMM configurations properly located on different points over this two-dimensional space were shown to be complementary to one another, jointly capturing the characteristics of the given corpus. By representing the given corpus as sequences of acoustic patterns on different HMM sets, the pattern indices in these sequences can be relabeled considering the context consistency across the different sequences. Good improvements were observed in preliminary experiments of pattern spoken term detection (STD) performed on both TIMIT and Mandarin Broadcast News with such enhanced patterns.

本文提出了一种新的方法来增强从给定的语料库自动发现的多组声学模式。在之前的工作中，提出了针对声学图案的不同HMM配置（每个模型的状态的数量，不同模型的数量）形成二维空间。在这个二维空间的不同点上正确定位的HMM配置自动发现的多组声学模式被证明是相互补充的，共同捕捉给定语料库的特征。通过将给定的语料库表示为不同HMM集合上的声学模式序列，考虑到不同序列上的上下文一致性，可以对这些序列中的模式索引进行重新标记。在TIMIT和普通话广播新闻中进行的模式口头词检测（STD）的初步实验中观察到具有如此增强模式的良好改进。
