##### Abstract
In this paper, an effective unconstrained correlation filter called Uncon- strained Optimal Origin Tradeoff Filter (UOOTF) is presented and applied to robust face recognition. Compared with the conventional correlation filters in Class-dependence Feature Analysis (CFA), UOOTF improves the overall performance for unseen patterns by removing the hard constraints on the origin correlation outputs during the filter design. To handle non-linearly separable distributions between different classes, we further develop a non- linear extension of UOOTF based on the kernel technique. The kernel ex- tension of UOOTF allows for higher flexibility of the decision boundary due to a wider range of non-linearity properties. Experimental results demon- strate the effectiveness of the proposed unconstrained correlation filter and its kernelization in the task of face recognition.

##### Abstract (translated by Google)
本文提出了一种有效的无约束相关滤波器，称为无约束最优产地平衡滤波器（UOOTF），并将其应用于鲁棒人脸识别。与类依赖特性分析（CFA）中的传统相关滤波器相比，UOOTF在滤波器设计中通过消除原始相关输出的严格限制来提高未见模式的整体性能。为了处理不同类之间的非线性可分的分布，我们进一步开发了基于核心技术的UOOTF的非线性扩展。由于非线性特性的范围更广，UOOTF的内核扩展允许决策边界更高的灵活性。实验结果证明了提出的无约束相关滤波器的有效性及其在人脸识别任务中的核化。
