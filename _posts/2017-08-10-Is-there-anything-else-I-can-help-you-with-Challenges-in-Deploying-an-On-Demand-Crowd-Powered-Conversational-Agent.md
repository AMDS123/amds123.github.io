##### Abstract
Intelligent conversational assistants, such as Apple's Siri, Microsoft's Cortana, and Amazon's Echo, have quickly become a part of our digital life. However, these assistants have major limitations, which prevents users from conversing with them as they would with human dialog partners. This limits our ability to observe how users really want to interact with the underlying system. To address this problem, we developed a crowd-powered conversational assistant, Chorus, and deployed it to see how users and workers would interact together when mediated by the system. Chorus sophisticatedly converses with end users over time by recruiting workers on demand, which in turn decide what might be the best response for each user sentence. Up to the first month of our deployment, 59 users have held conversations with Chorus during 320 conversational sessions. In this paper, we present an account of Chorus' deployment, with a focus on four challenges: (i) identifying when conversations are over, (ii) malicious users and workers, (iii) on-demand recruiting, and (iv) settings in which consensus is not enough. Our observations could assist the deployment of crowd-powered conversation systems and crowd-powered systems in general.

智能会话助手，如苹果的Siri，微软的Cortana和亚马逊的Echo，已经迅速成为我们数字生活的一部分。但是，这些助手有很大的局限性，阻止了用户与人类对话伙伴的交谈。这限制了我们观察用户真正想要与底层系统交互的能力。为了解决这个问题，我们开发了一个人群驱动的会话助理合唱团，并部署它来看用户和工作人员在系统调解时如何互动。随着时间的推移，合唱团与终端用户进行了高深的对话，通过按需招聘工作人员，进而决定每个用户句子的最佳答案。截至我们部署的第一个月，有59个用户在320个会话期间与Chorus进行了对话。在本文中，我们提出了合唱部署的一个帐户，重点是四个挑战：（i）确定对话何时结束，（ii）恶意用户和工作人员，（iii）按需招聘和（iv）设置在哪个共识是不够的。我们的观察可以帮助部署人群通话系统和人群驱动系统。
