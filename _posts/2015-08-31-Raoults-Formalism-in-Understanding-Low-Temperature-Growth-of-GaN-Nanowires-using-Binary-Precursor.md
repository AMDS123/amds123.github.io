##### Abstract
Growth of GaN nanowires are carried out via metal initiated vapor-liquid-solid mechanism, with Au as the catalyst. In chemical vapour deposition technique, GaN nanowires are usually grown at high temperatures in the range of 900-1100 ^oC because of low vapor pressure of Ga below 900 ^oC. In the present study, we have grown the GaN nanowires at a temperature, as low as 700 ^oC. Role of indium in the reduction of growth temperature is discussed in the ambit of Raoult's law. Indium is used to increase the vapor pressure of the Ga sufficiently to evaporate even at low temperature initiating the growth of GaN nanowires. In addition to the studies related to structural and vibrational properties, optical properties of the grown nanowires are also reported for detailed structural analysis.
