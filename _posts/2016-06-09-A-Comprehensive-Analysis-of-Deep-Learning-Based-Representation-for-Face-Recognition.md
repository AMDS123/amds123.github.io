##### Abstract
Deep learning based approaches have been dominating the face recognition field due to the significant performance improvement they have provided on the challenging wild datasets. These approaches have been extensively tested on such unconstrained datasets, on the Labeled Faces in the Wild and YouTube Faces, to name a few. However, their capability to handle individual appearance variations caused by factors such as head pose, illumination, occlusion, and misalignment has not been thoroughly assessed till now. In this paper, we present a comprehensive study to evaluate the performance of deep learning based face representation under several conditions including the varying head pose angles, upper and lower face occlusion, changing illumination of different strengths, and misalignment due to erroneous facial feature localization. Two successful and publicly available deep learning models, namely VGG-Face and Lightened CNN have been utilized to extract face representations. The obtained results show that although deep learning provides a powerful representation for face recognition, it can still benefit from preprocessing, for example, for pose and illumination normalization in order to achieve better performance under various conditions. Particularly, if these variations are not included in the dataset used to train the deep learning model, the role of preprocessing becomes more crucial. Experimental results also show that deep learning based representation is robust to misalignment and can tolerate facial feature localization errors up to 10% of the interocular distance.

基于深度学习的方法已经在人脸识别领域占据主导地位，这是因为他们在具有挑战性的野生数据集上提供了显着的性能改进。这些方法已经在这些不受约束的数据集，野外标签化面孔和YouTube面孔等方面进行了广泛的测试。但是，由于头部姿势，照明，咬合，错位等因素引起的个体外观变化的能力到现在还没有得到充分的评估。在本文中，我们提出了一个全面的研究来评估基于深度学习的人脸表示在多种条件下的性能，包括变化的头部姿态角度，上下脸部遮挡，不同强度的变化照明以及由于错误的脸部特征定位导致的未对准。两个成功和公开的深度学习模型，即VGG-Face和Lighted CNN已经被用来提取人脸表示。得到的结果表明，虽然深度学习为人脸识别提供了强有力的表示，但它仍然可以受益于预处理，例如姿态和光照归一化，以便在各种条件下获得更好的性能。特别是，如果这些变化不包括在训练深度学习模型的数据集中，那么预处理的作用就变得更加重要。实验结果还表明，基于深度学习的表示对于未对齐是有效的，并且能够容忍高达10％的双眼距离的面部特征定位误差。
