##### Abstract
This paper describes a possible way to improve computer security by implementing a program which implements the following three features related to a weak notion of artificial consciousness: (partial) self-monitoring, ability to compute the truth of quantifier-free propositions and the ability to communicate with the user. The integrity of the program could be enhanced by using a trusted computing approach, that is to say a hardware module that is at the root of a chain of trust. This paper outlines a possible approach but does not refer to an implementation (which would need further work), but the author believes that an implementation using current processors, a debugger, a monitoring program and a trusted processing module is currently possible.
