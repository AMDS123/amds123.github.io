##### Abstract
Due to the large amount of textual information available on Internet, it is of paramount relevance to use techniques that find relevant and concise content. A typical task devoted to the identification of informative sentences in documents is the so called extractive document summarization task. In this paper, we use complex network concepts to devise an extractive Multi Document Summarization (MDS) method, which extracts the most central sentences from several textual sources. In the proposed model, texts are represented as networks, where nodes represent sentences and the edges are established based on the number of shared words. Differently from previous works, the identification of relevant terms is guided by the characterization of nodes via dynamical measurements of complex networks, including symmetry, accessibility and absorption time. The evaluation of the proposed system revealed that excellent results were obtained with particular dynamical measurements, including those based on the exploration of networks via random walks.

由于互联网上提供了大量的文本信息，因此使用能够找到相关简洁内容的技术具有极其重要的意义。用于识别文件中信息句子的典型任务是所谓的抽取文件摘要任务。在本文中，我们使用复杂的网络概念来设计一个抽取的多文档摘要（MDS）方法，从多个文本源中提取最中心的句子。在所提出的模型中，文本被表示为网络，其中节点表示句子，并且边缘根据共享单词的数量来建立。与以前的工作不同，相关术语的识别是通过复杂网络的动态测量来表征节点，包括对称性，可达性和吸收时间。所提出的系统的评估显示，通过特定的动态测量获得了优异的结果，包括基于通过随机游走探索网络的结果。
