##### Abstract
The European Southern Observatory's (ESO) Visible and Infrared Survey Telescope for Astronomy (VISTA) is a 4-m class survey telescope for wide-field near-infrared imaging. VISTA is currently running a suite of six public surveys, which will shortly deliver their first Europe wide public data releases to ESO. The VISTA Kilo-degree Infrared Galaxy Survey (VIKING) forms a natural intermediate between current wide shallow, and deeper more concentrated surveys, by targeting two patches totalling 1500 sq.deg in the northern and southern hemispheres with measured 5-sigma limiting depths of Z ~ 22.4, Y ~ 21.4, J ~ 20.9, H ~ 19.9 and Ks ~19.3 (Vega). This architecture forms an ideal working parameter space for the discovery of a significant sample of 6.5 <= z <= 7.5 quasars. In the first data release priority has been placed on small areas encompassing a number of fields well sampled at many wavelengths, thereby optimising science gains and synergy whilst ensuring a timely release of the first products. For rare object searches e.g. high-z quasars, this policy is not ideal since photometric selection strategies generally evolve considerably with the acquisition of data. Without a reasonably representative data set sampling many directions on the sky it is not clear how a rare object search can be conducted in a highly complete and efficient manner. In this paper, we alleviate this problem by supplementing initial data with a realistic model of the spatial, luminosity and colour distributions of sources known to heavily contaminate photometric quasar selection spaces, namely dwarf stars of spectral type M, L and T. We use this model along with a subset of available data to investigate contamination of quasar selection space by cool stars and galaxies and lay down a set of benchmark selection constraints that limit contamination to reasonable levels whilst maintaining high completeness...
