##### Abstract
Firefighters suffer a variety of life-threatening risks, including line-of-duty deaths, injuries, and exposures to hazardous substances. Support for reducing these risks is important. We built a partially occluded object reconstruction method on augmented reality glasses for first responders. We used a deep learning based on conditional generative adversarial networks to train associations between the various images of flammable and hazardous objects and their partially occluded counterparts. Our system then reconstructed an image of a new flammable object. Finally, the reconstructed image was superimposed on the input image to provide "transparency". The system imitates human learning about the laws of physics through experience by learning the shape of flammable objects and the flame characteristics.

消防队员面临各种危及生命的风险，包括值班死亡，伤害和危险物质暴露。支持降低这些风险很重要。我们在增强现实眼镜上为第一响应者构建了部分遮挡对象重建方法。我们使用基于条件生成对抗网络的深度学习来训练易燃和危险物体及其部分遮挡对象的各种图像之间的关联。我们的系统然后重建了一个新的易燃物体的图像。最后，重建的图像叠加在输入图像上以提供“透明度”。该系统通过学习可燃物体的形状和火焰特性，通过经验模仿人类对物理定律的学习。
