##### Abstract
With the increasing need of personalised decision making, such as personalised medicine and online recommendations, a growing attention has been paid to the discovery of the context and heterogeneity of causal relationships. Most existing methods, however, assume a known cause (e.g. a new drug) and focus on identifying from data the contexts of heterogeneous effects of the cause (e.g. patient groups with different responses to the new drug). There is no approach to efficiently detecting directly from observational data context specific causal relationships, i.e. discovering the causes and their contexts simultaneously. In this paper, by taking the advantages of highly efficient decision tree induction and the well established causal inference framework, we propose the Tree based Context Causal rule discovery (TCC) method, for efficient exploration of context specific causal relationships from data. Experiments with both synthetic and real world data sets show that TCC can effectively discover context specific causal rules from the data.

随着个性化医疗和在线推荐等个性化决策的需求不断增加，人们越来越关注因果关系的背景和异质性的发现。然而，大多数现有方法假设已知原因（例如新药）并且关注于从数据中识别原因的异质效应的背景（例如，对新药具有不同反应的患者组）。没有办法有效地直接从观察数据上下文特定的因果关系中检测，即同时发现原因及其背景。在本文中，通过利用高效决策树归纳和完善的因果推理框架的优势，我们提出了基于树的上下文因果规则发现（TCC）方法，用于从数据中有效地探索上下文特定的因果关系。使用合成数据集和现实世界数据集的实验表明，TCC可以从数据中有效地发现上下文特定的因果规则。
