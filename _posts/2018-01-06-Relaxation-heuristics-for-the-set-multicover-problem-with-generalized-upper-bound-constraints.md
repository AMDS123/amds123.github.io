##### Abstract
We consider an extension of the set covering problem (SCP) introducing (i)~multicover and (ii)~generalized upper bound (GUB)~constraints. For the conventional SCP, the pricing method has been introduced to reduce the size of instances, and several efficient heuristic algorithms based on such reduction techniques have been developed to solve large-scale instances. However, GUB constraints often make the pricing method less effective, because they often prevent solutions from containing highly evaluated variables together. To overcome this problem, we develop heuristic algorithms to reduce the size of instances, in which new evaluation schemes of variables are introduced taking account of GUB constraints. We also develop an efficient implementation of a 2-flip neighborhood local search algorithm that reduces the number of candidates in the neighborhood without sacrificing the solution quality. In order to guide the search to visit a wide variety of good solutions, we also introduce a path relinking method that generates new solutions by combining two or more solutions obtained so far. According to computational comparison on benchmark instances, the proposed method succeeds in selecting a small number of promising variables properly and performs quite effectively even for large-scale instances having hard GUB constraints.

我们考虑扩展集覆盖问题（SCP）引入（i）〜多路复用和（ii）〜广义上界（GUB）约束。对于传统的SCP，已经引入定价方法来减小实例的大小，并且已经开发了几种基于这种减少技术的有效启发式算法来解决大规模实例。但是，GUB约束常常使得定价方法效率较低，因为它们经常会阻止解决方案将高度评估的变量包含在一起。为了克服这个问题，我们开发了启发式算法来减小实例的大小，其中考虑到GUB约束引入了新的变量评估方案。我们还开发了一个2翻转邻域局部搜索算法的有效实现，该算法减少了邻域中候选人的数量而不牺牲解的质量。为了引导搜索访问各种各样的优秀解决方案，我们还引入了一种路径重新链接方法，该方法通过结合迄今为止获得的两个或更多个解来生成新的解决方案。根据基准实例的计算比较，所提出的方法成功地选择了少量有前途的变量，并且即使对于具有硬GUB约束的大规模实例也能够有效地执行。
