##### Abstract
Flooding is the world's most costly type of natural disaster in terms of both economic losses and human causalities. A first and essential procedure towards flood monitoring is based on identifying the area most vulnerable to flooding, which gives authorities relevant regions to focus. In this work, we propose several methods to perform flooding identification in high-resolution remote sensing images using deep learning. Specifically, some proposed techniques are based upon unique networks, such as dilated and deconvolutional ones, while other was conceived to exploit diversity of distinct networks in order to extract the maximum performance of each classifier. Evaluation of the proposed algorithms were conducted in a high-resolution remote sensing dataset. Results show that the proposed algorithms outperformed several state-of-the-art baselines, providing improvements ranging from 1 to 4% in terms of the Jaccard Index.

在经济损失和人为因素方面，洪水是世界上成本最高的自然灾害类型。洪水监测的第一个基本步骤是基于确定最易受洪水侵袭的地区，这使当局有关地区得以重点关注。在这项工作中，我们提出了几种使用深度学习在高分辨率遥感图像中进行洪水识别的方法。具体而言，一些提出的技术是基于独特的网络，如扩张和去卷积的网络，而另一些则旨在利用不同网络的多样性，以提取每个分类器的最大性能。所提出的算法的评估是在高分辨率遥感数据集中进行的。结果表明，所提出的算法胜过了几个最先进的基线，根据Jaccard指数提供了从1％到4％的改进。
