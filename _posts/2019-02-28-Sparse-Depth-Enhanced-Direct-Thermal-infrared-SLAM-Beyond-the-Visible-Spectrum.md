##### Abstract
In this paper, we propose a thermal-infrared simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) system enhanced by sparse depth measurements from Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR). Thermal-infrared cameras are relatively robust against fog, smoke, and dynamic lighting conditions compared to RGB cameras operating under the visible spectrum. Due to the advantages of thermal-infrared cameras, exploiting them for motion estimation and mapping is highly appealing. However, operating a thermal-infrared camera directly in existing vision-based methods is difficult because of the modality difference. This paper proposes a method to use sparse depth measurement for 6-DOF motion estimation by directly tracking under 14- bit raw measurement of the thermal camera. In addition, we perform a refinement to improve the local accuracy and include a loop closure to maintain global consistency. The experimental results demonstrate that the system is not only robust under various lighting conditions such as day and night, but also overcomes the scale problem of monocular cameras.
