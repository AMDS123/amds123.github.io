##### Abstract
Many significant applications need land cover information of remote sensing images that are acquired from different areas and times, such as change detection and disaster monitoring. However, it is difficult to find a generic land cover classification scheme for different remote sensing images due to the spectral shift caused by diverse acquisition condition. In this paper, we develop a novel land cover classification method that can deal with large-scale data captured from widely distributed areas and different times. Additionally, we establish a large-scale land cover classification dataset consisting of 150 Gaofen-2 imageries as data support for model training and performance evaluation. Our experiments achieve outstanding classification accuracy compared with traditional methods.

许多重要的应用需要从不同地区和时间获取的遥感图像的土地覆盖信息，如变化检测和灾害监测。然而，由于采集条件的多样性导致谱变化，很难找到不同遥感图像的通用土地覆盖分类方案。在本文中，我们开发了一种新颖的土地覆盖分类方法，可以处理从广泛分布的区域和不同时间捕获的大规模数据。此外，我们还建立了由150个高芬2影像组成的大型土地覆盖分类数据集，作为模型培训和绩效评估的数据支持。与传统方法相比，我们的实验获得了出色的分类精度
