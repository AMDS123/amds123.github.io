##### Abstract
Communicative interactions involve a kind of procedural knowledge that is used by the human brain for processing verbal and nonverbal inputs and for language production. Although considerable work has been done on modeling human language abilities, it has been difficult to bring them together to a comprehensive tabula rasa system compatible with current knowledge of how verbal information is processed in the brain. This work presents a cognitive system, entirely based on a large-scale neural architecture, which was developed to shed light on the procedural knowledge involved in language elaboration. The main component of this system is the central executive, which is a supervising system that coordinates the other components of the working memory. In our model, the central executive is a neural network that takes as input the neural activation states of the short-term memory and yields as output mental actions, which control the flow of information among the working memory components through neural gating mechanisms. The proposed system is capable of learning to communicate through natural language starting from tabula rasa, without any a priori knowledge of the structure of phrases, meaning of words, role of the different classes of words, only by interacting with a human through a text-based interface, using an open-ended incremental learning process. It is able to learn nouns, verbs, adjectives, pronouns and other word classes, and to use them in expressive language. The model was validated on a corpus of 1587 input sentences, based on literature on early language assessment, at the level of about 4-years old child, and produced 521 output sentences, expressing a broad range of language processing functionalities.

交际互动涉及一种程序性的知识，被人类的大脑用来处理语言和非语言的输入以及语言的产生。虽然人类语言能力建模方面已经做了大量的工作，但是很难将它们集成到一个全面的白板系统中，与目前大脑中如何处理口头信息的知识相兼容。这项工作提出了一个完全基于大规模神经结构的认知系统，这个系统是为了阐明语言阐述过程中涉及的程序性知识。该系统的主要组成部分是中央执行机构，它是一个协调工作记忆的其他组成部分的监督系统。在我们的模型中，中央执行者是一个神经网络，将短期记忆的神经激活状态作为输入，并将其作为输出心智行为，通过神经门控机制控制工作记忆成分之间的信息流动。所提出的系统能够通过从白板开始的自然语言进行学习，而不需要关于短语的结构，词语的含义，不同类别的词语的任何先验知识，仅通过与文本相关联的人类来进行交互，使用开放式增量学习过程。它能够学习名词，动词，形容词，代词和其他词类，并用它们表达的语言。该模型基于关于早期语言评估的文献，在大约4岁儿童的水平上在1587个输入句子的语料库上进行了验证，并产生了521个输出句子，表达了广泛的语言处理功能。
