##### Abstract
We apply the Ordered Weighted Averaging (OWA) operator in multi-criteria decision-making. To satisfy different kinds of uncertainty, measure based dominance has been presented to gain the order of different criterion. However, this idea has not been applied in fuzzy system until now. In this paper, we focus on the situation where the linguistic satisfactions are fuzzy measures instead of the exact values. We review the concept of OWA operator and discuss the order mechanism of fuzzy number. Then we combine with measure-based dominance to give an overall score of each alternatives. An example is illustrated to show the whole procedure.
