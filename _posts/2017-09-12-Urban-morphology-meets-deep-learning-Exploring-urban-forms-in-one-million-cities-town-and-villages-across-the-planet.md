##### Abstract
Study of urban form is an important area of research in urban planning/design that contributes to our understanding of how cities function and evolve. However, classical approaches are based on very limited observations and inconsistent methods. As an alternative, availability of massive urban data collections such as Open Street Map from the one hand and the recent advancements in machine learning methods such as deep learning techniques on the other have opened up new possibilities to automatically investigate urban forms at the global scale. In this work for the first time, by collecting a large data set of street networks in more than one million cities, towns and villages all over the world, we trained a deep convolutional auto-encoder, that automatically learns the hierarchical structures of urban forms and represents them via dense and comparable vectors. We showed how the learned urban vectors could be used for different investigations. Using the learned urban vectors, one is able to easily find and compare similar urban forms all over the world, considering their overall spatial structure and other factors such as orientation, graphical structure, and density and partial deformations. Further cluster analysis reveals the distribution of the main patterns of urban forms all over the planet.

城市形态研究是城市规划/设计研究的一个重要领域，有助于我们理解城市如何运作和发展。然而，经典的方法是基于非常有限的观察和不一致的方法。另一方面，开放式街道地图等大规模城市数据收集的可用性以及深度学习技术等机器学习方法的最新进展为开展全球范围内的城市形态自动化研究提供了新的可能性。首次在这项工作中，我们通过在全世界100多万个城市和乡镇收集了大量的街道网络数据集，训练了一个深度卷积自动编码器，自动学习城市形态的层次结构并通过密集和相似的载体表示它们。我们展示了学习到的城市载体如何用于不同的调查。使用学习到的城市向量，可以很容易地找到和比较世界各地类似的城市形态，考虑到它们的整体空间结构和其他因素，如方向，图形结构，密度和部分变形。进一步的聚类分析揭示了全球城市形态的主要分布格局。
