##### Abstract
Most researchers regard AI as a static function without memory. This is one of the few articles where AI is seen as a device with memory. When we have memory, we can ask ourselves: "Where am I?", and "What is going on?" When we have no memory, we have to assume that we are always in the same place and that the world is always in the same state.

大多数研究人员认为人工智能是一种无记忆的静态功能这是AI被视为带有内存的设备的少数文章之一。当我们有记忆时，我们可以问自己：“我在哪里？”和“发生了什么事？”当我们没有记忆时，我们必须假设我们总是在同一个地方，并且世界总是处于相同的状态。
