##### Abstract
Wearable cameras can gather large amounts of image data that provide rich visual information about the daily activities of the wearer. Motivated by the large number of health applications that could be enabled by the automatic recognition of daily activities, such as lifestyle characterization for habit improvement, context-aware personal assistance and tele-rehabilitation services, we propose a system to classify 21 daily activities from photo-streams acquired by a wearable photo-camera. Our approach combines the advantages of a Late Fusion Ensemble strategy relying on convolutional neural networks at image level with the ability of recurrent neural networks to account for the temporal evolution of high level features in photo-streams. The proposed method was tested on a set of 44,902 egocentric images and achieved an overall accuracy of 87.07%, outperforming state of the art end-to-end methodologies.

可穿戴相机可以收集大量的图像数据，提供有关佩戴者日常活动的丰富视觉信息。受到自动识别日常活动（如改善生活习惯的生活习惯，情境感知个人帮助和远程康复服务）所能实现的大量健康应用的启发，我们提出了一个从照片中对21种日常活动进行分类的系统通过可穿戴照相机获取的流。我们的方法结合了依赖于卷积神经网络在图像层面的晚期融合集成策略的优点和递归神经网络能够解释光流中高层特征的时间演变的能力。所提出的方法在一组44902个以自我为中心的图像上进行测试，并且获得87.07％的总体准确度，优于现有技术的端到端方法。
