##### Abstract
In this paper, the Lingban entry to the third 'CHiME' speech separation and recognition challenge is presented. A time-frequency masking based speech enhancement front-end is proposed to suppress the environmental noise utilizing multi-channel coherence and spatial cues. The state-of-the-art speech recognition techniques, namely recurrent neural network based acoustic and language modeling, state space minimum Bayes risk based discriminative acoustic modeling, and i-vector based acoustic condition modeling, are carefully integrated into the speech recognition back-end. To further improve the system performance by fully exploiting the advantages of different technologies, the final recognition results are obtained by lattice combination and rescoring. Evaluations carried out on the official dataset prove the effectiveness of the proposed systems. Comparing with the best baseline result, the proposed system obtains consistent improvements with over 57% relative word error rate reduction on the real-data test set.

本文介绍了灵板进入第三届“中墨”语音分离与识别的挑战。提出了一种基于时频掩蔽的语音增强前端，利用多通道相干和空间线索来抑制环境噪声。基于递归神经网络的声学和语言建模，基于状态空间最小贝叶斯风险的判别式声学建模和基于i向量的声学条件建模的最先进的语音识别技术被仔细地整合到语音识别后端处理中，结束。通过充分利用不同技术的优势，进一步提高系统性能，最终识别结果通过格点组合和重新获得。对官方数据集进行的评估证明了所提议的系统的有效性。与最佳基线结果相比较，所提出的系统在实际数据测试集上获得了一致的改进，相对误码率降低了57％以上。
