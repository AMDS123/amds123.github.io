##### Abstract
The compressed sensing (CS) theory has been successfully applied to image compression in the past few years as most image signals are sparse in a certain domain. Several CS reconstruction models have been recently proposed and obtained superior performance. However, there still exist two important challenges within the CS theory. The first one is how to design a sampling mechanism to achieve an optimal sampling efficiency, and the second one is how to perform the reconstruction to get the highest quality to achieve an optimal signal recovery. In this paper, we try to deal with these two problems with a deep network. First of all, we train a sampling matrix via the network training instead of using a traditional manually designed one, which is much appropriate for our deep network based reconstruct process. Then, we propose a deep network to recover the image, which imitates traditional compressed sensing reconstruction processes. Experimental results demonstrate that our deep networks based CS reconstruction method offers a very significant quality improvement compared against state of the art ones.

压缩感知（CS）理论在过去几年已经成功应用于图像压缩，因为大多数图像信号在某个领域是稀疏的。最近提出了几种CS重建模型并获得了优越的性能。但是，CS理论仍然存在着两个重要的挑战。第一个是如何设计一个采样机制来实现最佳的采样效率，第二个是如何进行重构来获得最高的质量来实现最佳的信号恢复。在本文中，我们试图用深度网络来处理这两个问题。首先，我们通过网络训练来训练一个采样矩阵，而不是使用传统的手工设计的矩阵，这非常适合我们的深度网络重构过程。然后，我们提出一个深度网络来恢复图像，模仿传统的压缩感知重建过程。实验结果表明，我们的基于深度网络的CS重建方法与现有技术相比提供了非常显着的质量改进。
