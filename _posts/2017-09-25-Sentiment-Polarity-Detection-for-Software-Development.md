##### Abstract
The role of sentiment analysis is increasingly emerging to study software developers' emotions by mining crowd-generated content within social software engineering tools. However, off-the-shelf sentiment analysis tools have been trained on non-technical domains and general-purpose social media, thus resulting in misclassifications of technical jargon and problem reports. Here, we present Senti4SD, a classifier specifically trained to support sentiment analysis in developers' communication channels. Senti4SD is trained and validated using a gold standard of Stack Overflow questions, answers, and comments manually annotated for sentiment polarity. It exploits a suite of both lexicon- and keyword-based features, as well as semantic features based on word embedding. With respect to a mainstream off-the-shelf tool, which we use as a baseline, Senti4SD reduces the misclassifications of neutral and positive posts as emotionally negative. To encourage replications, we release a lab package including the classifier, the word embedding space, and the gold standard with annotation guidelines.

##### Abstract (translated by Google)
情感分析的角色越来越多地通过在社交软件工程工具中挖掘人群生成的内容来研究软件开发者的情绪。然而，现成的情绪分析工具已经在非技术领域和通用社交媒体上进行了培训，从而导致对技术术语和问题报告的错误分类。在这里，我们介绍Senti4SD，一个经过专门培训的分类器，以支持开发人员沟通渠道中的情感分析。 Senti4SD使用堆栈溢出问题，答案和评论的黄金标准进行训练和验证，手动注释了情感极性。它利用了一套基于词典和关键词的特征，以及基于词嵌入的语义特征。对于我们用作基线的主流现成工具，Senti4SD将中立和正面职位的错误分类减少为情绪负面。为了鼓励复制，我们发布了包含分类器，嵌入空间这个词的实验包，以及带有注解准则的黄金标准。
