##### Abstract
Opinion mining mainly involves three elements: feature and feature-of relations, opinion expressions and the related opinion attributes (e.g. Polarity), and feature-opinion relations. Although many works have emerged to achieve its aim of gaining information, the previous researches typically handled each of the three elements in isolation, which cannot give sufficient information extraction results; hence, the complexity and the running time of information extraction is increased. In this paper, we propose an opinion mining extraction algorithm to jointly discover the main opinion mining elements. Specifically, the algorithm automatically builds kernels to combine closely related words into new terms from word level to phrase level based on dependency relations; and we ensure the accuracy of opinion expressions and polarity based on: fuzzy measurements, opinion degree intensifiers, and opinion patterns. The 3458 analyzed reviews show that the proposed algorithm can effectively identify the main elements simultaneously and outperform the baseline methods. The proposed algorithm is used to analyze the features among heterogeneous products in the same category. The feature-by-feature comparison can help to select the weaker features and recommend the correct specifications from the beginning life of a product. From this comparison, some interesting observations are revealed. For example, the negative polarity of video dimension is higher than the product usability dimension for a product. Yet, enhancing the dimension of product usability can more effectively improve the product (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.
