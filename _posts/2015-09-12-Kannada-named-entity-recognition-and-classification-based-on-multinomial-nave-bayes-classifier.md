##### Abstract
Named Entity Recognition and Classification (NERC) is a process of identification of proper nouns in the text and classification of those nouns into certain predefined categories like person name, location, organization, date, and time etc. NERC in Kannada is an essential and challenging task. The aim of this work is to develop a novel model for NERC, based on Multinomial Na\"ive Bayes (MNB) Classifier. The Methodology adopted in this paper is based on feature extraction of training corpus, by using term frequency, inverse document frequency and fitting them to a tf-idf-vectorizer. The paper discusses the various issues in developing the proposed model. The details of implementation and performance evaluation are discussed. The experiments are conducted on a training corpus of size 95,170 tokens and test corpus of 5,000 tokens. It is observed that the model works with Precision, Recall and F1-measure of 83%, 79% and 81% respectively.

命名实体识别和分类（NERC）是在文本中对专有名词进行识别的过程，并将这些名词分类为特定的预定义类别，如人名，位置，组织，日期和时间等.NERC在卡纳达任务。本文的研究目标是基于多项式贝叶斯（MNB）分类器开发一种新型的NERC模型，本文采用的方法是基于训练语料库的特征提取，利用词频，逆文档频率并将它们拟合成一个tf-idf矢量化器，讨论了该模型开发过程中的各种问题，讨论了实现的细节和性能评估，对一个95170个标记的训练语料库和5000个测试语料可以观察到该模型的精度，召回率分别为83％，79％和81％。
