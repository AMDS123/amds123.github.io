##### Abstract
Basing on the theory for arbitrary oriented surfaces, we developed the theory of the moir\'e effect for cylindrical single-layer objects in the paraxial approximation. With using the dual grids, the moir\'e effect in the plane gratings is simulated, as well as the near-axis moir\'e effect in cylinders including the chiral layouts. The results can be applied to the graphene layers, to single-walled nanotubes, and to cylinders in general.

本文在任意取向表面理论的基础上，建立了傍轴近似下圆柱单层物体的摩尔效应理论。利用双栅格，模拟了平面光栅中的摩尔效应，以及包括手征布局在内的近轴摩尔效应。结果可以应用于石墨烯层，单壁纳米管和一般的圆柱体。
