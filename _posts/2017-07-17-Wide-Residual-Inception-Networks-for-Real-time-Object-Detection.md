##### Abstract
Since convolutional neural network(CNN)models emerged,several tasks in computer vision have actively deployed CNN models for feature extraction. However,the conventional CNN models have a high computational cost and require high memory capacity, which is impractical and unaffordable for commercial applications such as real-time on-road object detection on embedded boards or mobile platforms. To tackle this limitation of CNN models, this paper proposes a wide-residual-inception (WR-Inception) network, which constructs the architecture based on a residual inception unit that captures objects of various sizes on the same feature map, as well as shallower and wider layers, compared to state-of-the-art networks like ResNet. To verify the proposed networks, this paper conducted two experiments; one is a classification task on CIFAR-10/100 and the other is an on-road object detection task using a Single-Shot Multi-box Detector(SSD) on the KITTI dataset.

由于卷积神经网络（CNN）模型的出现，计算机视觉中的几个任务已经积极配置CNN模型进行特征提取。然而，传统的CNN模型计算成本较高，需要较高的存储容量，对于嵌入式板卡或移动平台上的实时路上物体检测等商业应用来说，这是不切实际和不可支付的。为了解决CNN模型的局限性，本文提出了一种基于残差初始单元的广义残差初始化（WR-Inception）网络，该残差初始单元在相同的特征映射上捕获各种尺寸的对象，和更广泛的层，相比最先进的网络，如ResNet。为了验证提出的网络，本文进行了两个实验;一个是在CIFAR-10/100上的分类任务，另一个是在KITTI数据集上使用单发多盒检测器（SSD）的路上物体检测任务。
