##### Abstract
In this study we approach the problem of distinguishing general profanity from hate speech in social media, something which has not been widely considered. Using a new dataset annotated specifically for this task, we employ supervised classification along with a set of features that includes n-grams, skip-grams and clustering-based word representations. We apply approaches based on single classifiers as well as more advanced ensemble classifiers and stacked generalization, achieving the best result of 80% accuracy for this 3-class classification task. Analysis of the results reveals that discriminating hate speech and profanity is not a simple task, which may require features that capture a deeper understanding of the text not always possible with surface n-grams. The variability of gold labels in the annotated data, due to differences in the subjective adjudications of the annotators, is also an issue. Other directions for future work are discussed.

在这项研究中，我们将社会媒体中的仇恨言论与一般亵渎行为区分开来，这个问题尚未得到广泛的考虑。使用专门为此任务注释的新数据集，我们采用监督分类以及一组功能，其中包括n-gram，skip-grams和基于聚类的词表示。我们应用基于单个分类器以及更先进的集成分类器和堆叠泛化的方法，实现这个3类分类任务的80％准确度的最佳结果。分析结果表明，歧视仇恨言论和亵渎并不是一项简单的任务，这可能需要功能来捕捉对文本的深入理解，而这些文本对于表面n-gram并不总是可能的。由于注释者主观判断的差异，注释数据中黄金标签的变化也是一个问题。讨论未来工作的其他方向。
