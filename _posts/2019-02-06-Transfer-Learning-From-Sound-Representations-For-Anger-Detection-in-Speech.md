##### Abstract
In this work, we train fully convolutional networks to detect anger in speech. Since training these deep architectures requires large amounts of data and the size of emotion datasets is relatively small, we use transfer learning. However, unlike previous approaches that use speech or emotion-based tasks for the source model, we instead use SoundNet, a fully convolutional neural network trained multimodally on a massive video dataset to classify audio, with ground-truth labels provided by vision-based classifiers. As a result of transfer learning from SoundNet, our trained anger detection model improves performance and generalizes well on a variety of acted, elicited, and natural emotional speech datasets. We also test the cross-lingual effectiveness of our model by evaluating our English-trained model on Mandarin Chinese speech emotion data. Furthermore, our proposed system has low latency suitable for real-time applications, only requiring 1.2 seconds of audio to make a reliable classification.
