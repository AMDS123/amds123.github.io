##### Abstract
Recently, due to the collection of large scale 3D face models, as well as the advent of deep learning, a significant progress has been made in the field of 3D face alignment "in-the-wild". That is, many methods have been proposed that establish sparse or dense 3D correspondences between a 2D facial image and a 3D face model. The utilization of 3D face alignment introduces new challenges and research directions, especially on the analysis of facial texture images. In particular, texture does not suffer any more from warping effects (that occurred when 2D face alignment methods were used). Nevertheless, since facial images are commonly captured in arbitrary recording conditions, a considerable amount of missing information and gross outliers is observed (e.g., due to self-occlusion, or subjects wearing eye-glasses). Given that many annotated databases have been developed for face analysis tasks, it is evident that component analysis techniques need to be developed in order to alleviate issues arising from the aforementioned challenges. In this paper, we propose a novel component analysis technique that is suitable for facial UV maps containing a considerable amount of missing information and outliers, while additionally, incorporates knowledge from various attributes (such as age and identity). We evaluate the proposed Multi-Attribute Robust Component Analysis (MA-RCA) on problems such as UV completion and age progression, where the proposed method outperforms compared techniques. Finally, we demonstrate that MA-RCA method is powerful enough to provide weak annotations for training deep learning systems for various applications, such as illumination transfer.

近年来，由于大面积三维人脸模型的收集，以及深度学习的出现，“野内”三维人脸对齐领域取得了重大进展。也就是说，已经提出了许多方法来建立2D面部图像和3D面部模型之间的稀疏或密集的3D对应。三维人脸定位技术的应用带来了新的挑战和研究方向，特别是面部纹理图像的分析。特别是纹理不会受到翘曲效应（使用2D面对齐方法时发生）的影响。然而，由于通常在任意记录条件下捕捉面部图像，所以观察到大量的遗漏信息和总的异常值（例如，由于自闭症或者戴着眼镜的受试者）。鉴于许多注释数据库已经被开发用于脸部分析任务，显然需要开发组件分析技术以减轻上述挑战引起的问题。在本文中，我们提出了一种新颖的分量分析技术，适用于包含大量缺失信息和异常值的面部UV图，同时还包含了来自各种属性（如年龄和身份）的知识。我们评估提出的多属性鲁棒组件分析（MA-RCA）的问题，如紫外线完成和年龄进展，其中提出的方法胜过比较技术。最后，我们证明MA-RCA方法足够强大，可以为各种应用（如照明传输）提供深度学习系统的弱注释。
