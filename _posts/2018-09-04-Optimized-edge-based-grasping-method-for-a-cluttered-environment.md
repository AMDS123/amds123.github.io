##### Abstract
This paper looks into the problem of grasping region localization along with suitable pose from a cluttered environment without any a priori knowledge of the object geometry. This end-to-end method detects the handles from a single frame of input sensor. The pipeline starts with the creation of multiple surface segments to detect the required gap in the first stage, and eventually helps in detecting boundary lines. Our novelty lies in the fact that we have merged color based edge and depth edge in order to get more reliable boundary points through which a pair of boundary line is fitted. Also this information is used to validate the handle by measuring the angle between the boundary lines and also by checking for amy potential occlusion. In addition, we also proposed an optimizing cost function based method to choose the best handle from a set of valid handles. The method proposed is tested on real-life datasets and is found to out form state of the art methods in terms of precision.

本文研究了在没有任何物体几何学先验知识的情况下从杂乱环境中抓取区域定位以及合适姿态的问题。这种端到端方法从单帧输入传感器检测手柄。管道从创建多个表面段开始，以检测第一阶段中所需的间隙，并最终帮助检测边界线。我们的新颖之处在于我们合并了基于颜色的边缘和深度边缘，以便获得更加可靠的边界点，通过这些边界点可以安装一对边界线。此信息还用于通过测量边界线之间的角度以及通过检查amy潜在遮挡来验证手柄。此外，我们还提出了一种基于优化成本函数的方法，从一组有效句柄中选择最佳句柄。所提出的方法在现实生活中的数据集上进行了测试，并且在精度方面被发现形成了最先进的方法。
