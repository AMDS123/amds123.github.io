##### Abstract
This dataset challenges the time series community with the task of satellite-based vegetation identification on large scale real-world dataset of satellite data acquired during one entire year. It consists of time series data with associated crop types from 580k field parcels in Brittany, France (Breizh in local language). Along with this dataset, we provide results and code of a Long Short-Term Memory network and Transformer network as baselines. We release dataset, along with preprocessing scripts and baseline models in this https URL and encourage methodical researchers to benchmark and develop novel methods applied to satellite-based crop monitoring.
