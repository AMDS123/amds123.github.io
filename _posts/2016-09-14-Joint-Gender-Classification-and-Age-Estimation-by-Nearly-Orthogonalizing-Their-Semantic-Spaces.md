##### Abstract
In human face-based biometrics, gender classification and age estimation are two typical learning tasks. Although a variety of approaches have been proposed to handle them, just a few of them are solved jointly, even so, these joint methods do not yet specifically concern the semantic difference between human gender and age, which is intuitively helpful for joint learning, consequently leaving us a room of further improving the performance. To this end, in this work we firstly propose a general learning framework for jointly estimating human gender and age by specially attempting to formulate such semantic relationships as a form of near-orthogonality regularization and then incorporate it into the objective of the joint learning framework. In order to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed framework, we exemplify it by respectively taking the widely used binary-class SVM for gender classification, and two threshold-based ordinal regression methods (i.e., the discriminant learning for ordinal regression and support vector ordinal regression) for age estimation, and crucially coupling both through the proposed semantic formulation. Moreover, we develop its kernelized nonlinear counterpart by deriving a representer theorem for the joint learning strategy. Finally, through extensive experiments on three aging datasets FG-NET, Morph Album I and Morph Album II, we demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed joint learning strategy.

在基于人脸的生物测量学中，性别分类和年龄估计是两个典型的学习任务。虽然已经提出了各种方法来处理它们，但是其中的少数几个可以联合解决，即使如此，这些联合方法还没有特别关注人类性别和年龄之间的语义差异，这对于联合学习是直观上有帮助的，因此给我们留下了进一步改善表现的空间。为此，本文首先提出了一个通用的学习框架，通过专门设计这种语义关系作为一种近正交正则化的形式，然后将其纳入到联合学习框架的目标中来共同估计人的性别和年龄。为了评估所提出的框架的有效性，我们通过分别采用广泛使用的用于性别分类的二元类SVM和两种基于阈值的序数回归方法（即用于序数回归和支持向量序列回归的判别式学习）进行年龄估计，并通过所提出的语义表达来关键地耦合两者。此外，我们通过推导联合学习策略的表示者定理来发展其核化的非线性对应。最后，通过对三个老化数据集FG-NET，Morph Album I和Morph Album II进行广泛的实验，证明了所提出的联合学习策略的有效性和优越性。
