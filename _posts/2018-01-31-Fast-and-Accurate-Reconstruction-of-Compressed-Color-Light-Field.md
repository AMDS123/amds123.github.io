##### Abstract
Light field photography has been studied thoroughly in recent years. One of its drawbacks is the need for multilens in the imaging. To compensate that, compressed light field photography has been proposed to tackle the tradeoffs between the spatial and angular resolutions. It obtains using only one lens, a compressed version of the regular multi-lens system. The acquisition system consists of a dedicated hardware followed by a decompression algorithm, which usually suffers from high computational time. In our work, we suggest to compress the color channels as well and propose a computationally efficient neural network that achieves high-quality color light field reconstruction from a single coded image. Our approach outperforms existing solutions in terms of recovery quality and computational complexity. We also present a neural network for depth map extraction from the decompressed light field, which is trained in an unsupervised way without the ground truth depth map.

近年来对光场摄影进行了深入的研究。其缺点之一是在成像中需要多透镜。为了弥补这一点，已经提出压缩光场照相来解决空间和角度分辨率之间的折衷。它只使用一个镜头，一个普通的多镜头系统的压缩版本。采集系统由一个专用硬件和一个解压缩算法组成，而这个解压算法通常会遇到很高的计算时间。在我们的工作中，我们建议压缩彩色通道，并提出一个计算效率高的神经网络，实现从单一的编码图像高品质的彩色光场重建。我们的方法在恢复质量和计算复杂度方面优于现有解决方案。我们还提出了一个从解压的光场中提取深度图的神经网络，它是以无监督的方式训练的，没有地面深度图。
