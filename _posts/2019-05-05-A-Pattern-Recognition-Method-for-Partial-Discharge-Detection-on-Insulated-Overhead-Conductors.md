##### Abstract
Today,insulated overhead conductors are increasingly used in many places of the world due to the higher operational reliability, elimination of phase-to-phase contact, closer distances between phases and stronger protection for animals. However, the standard protection devices are often not able to detect the conductor phase-to-ground fault and the more frequent tree/tree branch hitting conductor events as these events only lead to partial discharge (PD) activities instead of causing overcurrent seen on bare conductors. To solve this problem, in recent years, Technical University of Ostrava (VSB) devised a special meter to measure the voltage signal of the stray electrical field along the insulated overhead conductors, hoping to detect the above hazardous PD activities. In 2018, VSB published a large amount of waveform data recorded by their meter on Kaggle, the world's largest data science collaboration platform, looking for promising pattern recognition methods for this application. To tackle this challenge, we developed a unique method based on Seasonal and Trend decomposition using Loess (STL) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) to recognize PD activities on insulated overhead conductors. Different SVM kernels were tested and compared. Satisfactory classification rates on VSB dataset were achieved with the use of Gaussian radial basis kernel.
