##### Abstract
We study strain relaxation and surface damage of GaN nanopillar arrays fabricated using inductively coupled plasma (ICP) etching and post etch wet chemical treatment. We controlled the shape and surface damage of such nanopillar structures through selection of etching parameters. We compared different substrate temperatures and different chlorine-based etch chemistries to fabricate high quality GaN nanopillars. Room temperature photoluminescence and Raman scattering measurements were carried to study the presence of surface defect and strain relaxation on these nanostructures, respectively. We found that wet KOH etching can remove the side wall damages caused by dry plasma etching, leading to better quality of GaN nanopillars arrays. The Si material underneath the GaN pillars was removed by KOH wet etching, leaving behind a fine Si pillar to support the GaN structure. Substantial strain relaxations were observed in these structures from room temperature Raman spectroscopy measurements. Room temperature Photoluminescence spectroscopy shows the presence of whispering gallery modes from these the nano disks structures.

我们研究了利用电感耦合等离子体（ICP）刻蚀和后蚀刻湿化学处理制造的GaN纳米柱阵列的应变松弛和表面损伤。我们通过选择蚀刻参数来控制这种纳米柱结构的形状和表面损伤。我们比较了不同的衬底温度和不同的氯基蚀刻剂，以制造出高质量的GaN纳米柱。进行室温光致发光和拉曼散射测量以分别研究这些纳米结构上的表面缺陷和应变松弛的存在。我们发现湿法KOH刻蚀可以消除干法等离子刻蚀造成的侧壁损伤，从而提高GaN纳米柱阵列的质量。 GaN柱下方的Si材料通过KOH湿法蚀刻去除，留下精细的Si柱以支撑GaN结构。在室温拉曼光谱测量的这些结构中观察到实质应变松弛。室温光致发光光谱显示这些纳米盘结构存在耳语廊模式。
