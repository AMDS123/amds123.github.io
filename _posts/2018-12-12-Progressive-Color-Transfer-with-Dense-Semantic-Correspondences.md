##### Abstract
We propose a new algorithm for color transfer between images that have perceptually similar semantic structures. We aim to achieve a more accurate color transfer that leverages semantically-meaningful dense correspondence between images. To accomplish this, our algorithm uses neural representations for matching. Additionally, the color transfer should be spatially variant and globally coherent. Therefore, our algorithm optimizes a local linear model for color transfer satisfying both local and global constraints. Our proposed approach jointly optimizes matching and color transfer, adopting a coarse-to-fine strategy. The proposed method can be successfully extended from one-to-one to one-to-many color transfer. The latter further addresses the problem of mismatching elements of the input image. We validate our proposed method by testing it on a large variety of image content.
