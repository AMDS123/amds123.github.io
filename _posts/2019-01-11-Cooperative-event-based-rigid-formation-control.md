##### Abstract
This paper discusses cooperative stabilization control of rigid formations via an event-based approach. We first design a centralized event-based formation control system, in which a central event controller determines the next triggering time and broadcasts the event signal to all the agents for control input update. We then build on this approach to propose a distributed event control strategy, in which each agent can use its local event trigger and local information to update the control input at its own event time. For both cases, the triggering condition, event function and triggering behavior are discussed in detail, and the exponential convergence of the event-based formation system is guaranteed.
