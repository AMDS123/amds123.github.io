##### Abstract
In this paper, we describe recent performance improvements to the production Marchex speech recognition system for our spontaneous customer-to-business telephone conversations. In our previous work, we focused on in-domain language and acoustic model training. In this work we employ state-of-the-art semi-supervised lattice-free maximum mutual information (LF-MMI) training process which can supervise over full lattices from unlabeled audio. On Marchex English (ME), a modern evaluation set of conversational North American English, we observed a 3.3% (3.2% for agent, 3.6% for caller) reduction in absolute word error rate (WER) with 3x faster decoding speed over the performance of the 2017 production system. We expect this improvement boost Marchex Call Analytics system performance especially for natural language processing pipeline.
