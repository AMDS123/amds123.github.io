##### Abstract
A problem faced by many instructors is that of designing exams that accurately assess the abilities of the students. Typically these exams are prepared several days in advance, and generic question scores are used based on rough approximation of the question difficulty and length. For example, for a recent class taught by the author, there were 30 multiple choice questions worth 3 points, 15 true/false with explanation questions worth 4 points, and 5 analytical exercises worth 10 points. We describe a novel framework where algorithms from machine learning are used to modify the exam question weights in order to optimize the exam scores, using the overall class grade as a proxy for a student's true ability. We show that significant error reduction can be obtained by our approach over standard weighting schemes, and we make several new observations regarding the properties of the "good" and "bad" exam questions that can have impact on the design of improved future evaluation methods.

许多教师面临的问题是设计考试，准确评估学生的能力。通常情况下，这些考试是提前几天准备的，通用的问题分数是根据问题难度和长度的粗略近似来使用的。例如，笔者最近的一堂课，有30个选择题3分，15分为真，有解释题4分，10分为10分。我们描述了一个新的框架，其中来自机器学习的算法被用来修改考题的权重，以优化考试成绩，使用总体的成绩作为学生真实能力的代表。我们表明，通过我们的标准加权方案的方法可以获得显着的误差减少，并且我们对可能影响改进的未来评估方法的设计的“好”和“坏”考试题目的属性提出几个新的观察。
