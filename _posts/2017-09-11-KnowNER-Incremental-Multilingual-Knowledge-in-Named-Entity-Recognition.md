##### Abstract
KnowNER is a multilingual Named Entity Recognition (NER) system that leverages different degrees of external knowledge. A novel modular framework divides the knowledge into four categories according to the depth of knowledge they convey. Each category consists of a set of features automatically generated from different information sources (such as a knowledge-base, a list of names or document-specific semantic annotations) and is used to train a conditional random field (CRF). Since those information sources are usually multilingual, KnowNER can be easily trained for a wide range of languages. In this paper, we show that the incorporation of deeper knowledge systematically boosts accuracy and compare KnowNER with state-of-the-art NER approaches across three languages (i.e., English, German and Spanish) performing amongst state-of-the art systems in all of them.

##### Abstract (translated by Google)
KnowNER是一个多语言命名实体识别（NER）系统，利用不同程度的外部知识。一个新颖的模块化框架根据知识的深度将知识分为四类。每个类别由不同信息源（如知识库，名称列表或文档特定语义注释）自动生成的一组特征组成，用于训练条件随机场（CRF）。由于这些信息源通常是多语言的，因此KnowNER可以很容易地接受各种语言的培训。在本文中，我们表明，更深层次的知识系统地提高了准确性，并将三种语言（即英语，德语和西班牙语）中的KnowNER与最先进的NER方法进行比较，他们全部。
