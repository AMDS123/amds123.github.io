##### Abstract
Imitation learning for end-to-end autonomous driving has drawn attention from academic communities. Current methods either only use images as the input which is ambiguous when a car approaches an intersection, or use additional command information to navigate the vehicle but not automated enough. Focusing on making the vehicle drive along the given path, we propose a new navigation command that does not require human's participation and a novel model architecture called angle branched network. Both the new navigation command and the angle branched network are easy to understand and effective. Besides, we find that not only segmentation information but also depth information can boost the performance of the driving model. We conduct experiments in a 3D urban simulator and both qualitative and quantitative evaluation results show the effectiveness of our model.

学习社区关注端到端自动驾驶的模仿学习。当前的方法或者仅使用图像作为当汽车接近交叉口时模糊的输入，或者使用附加的命令信息来导航车辆但不够自动化。着眼于使车辆沿着给定路径行驶，我们提出了一种不需要人参与的新导航命令和一种称为角度分支网络的新型模型架构。新的导航命令和角度分支网络都很容易理解和有效。此外，我们发现不仅分割信息而且深度信息都可以提高驾驶模型的性能。我们在三维城市模拟器中进行实验，定性和定量评估结果都显示了我们模型的有效性。
