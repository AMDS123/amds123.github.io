##### Abstract
Recently ConvNets or convolutional neural networks (CNN) have come up as state-of-the-art classification and detection algorithms, achieving near-human performance in visual detection. However, ConvNet algorithms are typically very computation and memory intensive. In order to be able to embed ConvNet-based classification into wearable platforms and embedded systems such as smartphones or ubiquitous electronics for the internet-of-things, their energy consumption should be reduced drastically. This paper proposes methods based on approximate computing to reduce energy consumption in state-of-the-art ConvNet accelerators. By combining techniques both at the system- and circuit level, we can gain energy in the systems arithmetic: up to 30x without losing classification accuracy and more than 100x at 99% classification accuracy, compared to the commonly used 16-bit fixed point number format.

最近ConvNets或卷积神经网络（CNN）已经成为最新的分类和检测算法，在视觉检测中实现接近人类的性能。然而，ConvNet算法通常是非常计算和内存密集型的。为了能够将基于ConvNet的分类技术嵌入到可穿戴平台和智能手机等嵌入式系统或物联网的无处不在的电子产品中，应大幅降低其能耗。本文提出了基于近似计算的方法来降低最先进的ConvNet加速器的能耗。通过在系统级和电路级组合技术，我们可以在系统运算中获得能量：与常用的16位定点数字格式相比，分类精度可达30倍，分类精度可达99％，分类精度可达100倍以上。
