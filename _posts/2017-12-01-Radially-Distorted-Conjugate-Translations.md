##### Abstract
This paper introduces the first minimal solvers that jointly solve for affine-rectification and radial lens distortion from coplanar repeated patterns. Even with imagery from moderately distorted lenses, plane rectification using the pinhole camera model is inaccurate or invalid. The proposed solvers incorporate lens distortion into the camera model and extend accurate rectification to wide-angle imagery, which is now common from consumer cameras. The solvers are derived from constraints induced by the conjugate translations of an imaged scene plane, which are integrated with the division model for radial lens distortion. The hidden-variable trick with ideal saturation is used to reformulate the constraints so that the solvers generated by the Grobner-basis method are stable, small and fast. The proposed solvers are used in a RANSAC-based estimator. Rectification and lens distortion are recovered from either one conjugately translated affine-covariant feature or two independently translated similarity-covariant features. Experiments confirm that RANSAC accurately estimates the rectification and radial distortion with very few iterations. The proposed solvers are evaluated against the state-of-the-art for affine rectification and radial distortion estimation.

本文介绍了从共面重复模式共同解决仿射校正和径向透镜畸变的第一种最小解算器。即使使用适度变形的镜头的图像，使用针孔照相机模型的平面矫正也是不准确的或无效的。所提出的解算器将镜头畸变纳入相机模型中，并将精确纠正扩展到广角图像，这在消费相机中现在是常见的。求解器是由成像场景平面的共轭平移引起的约束导出的，与用于径向透镜畸变的分割模型相结合。利用理想饱和隐变量技巧重新约束约束，使基于Grobner方法产生的求解器稳定，小巧，快速。所提出的求解器被用于基于RANSAC的估计器中。从任一个共轭平移的仿射协变特征或两个独立翻译的相似协变特征中恢复整流和透镜畸变。实验证实，RANSAC能够以很少的迭代准确地估计整流和径向失真。所提出的求解器是针对仿射校正和径向失真估计的最新技术进行评估的。
