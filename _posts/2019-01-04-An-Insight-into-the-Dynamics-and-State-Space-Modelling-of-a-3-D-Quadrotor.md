##### Abstract
Drones have gained popularity in a wide range of field ranging from aerial photography, aerial mapping, and investigation of electric power lines. Every drone that we know today is carrying out some kind of control algorithm at the low level in order to manoeuvre itself around. For the quadrotor to either control itself autonomously or to develop a high-level user interface for us to control it, we need to understand the basic mathematics behind how it functions. This paper aims to explain the mathematical modelling of the dynamics of a 3 Dimensional quadrotor. As it may seem like a trivial task, it plays a vital role in how we control the drone. Also, additional effort has been taken to explain the transformations of the drone's frame of reference to the inertial frame of reference.
