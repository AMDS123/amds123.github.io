##### Abstract
We present a general framework and method for simultaneous detection and segmentation of an object in a video that moves (or comes into view of the camera) at some unknown time in the video. The method is an online approach based on motion segmentation, and it operates under dynamic backgrounds caused by a moving camera or moving nuisances. The goal of the method is to detect and segment the object as soon as it moves. Due to stochastic variability in the video and unreliability of the motion signal, several frames are needed to reliably detect the object. The method is designed to detect and segment with minimum delay subject to a constraint on the false alarm rate. The method is derived as a problem of Quickest Change Detection. Experiments on a dataset show the effectiveness of our method in minimizing detection delay subject to false alarm constraints.

我们提出了一个通用的框架和方法，用于同时检测和分割视频中的某个对象，该视频在视频中的某个未知时间移动（或进入相机的视图）。该方法是一种基于运动分割的在线方法，在运动相机或移动滋扰引起的动态背景下运行。该方法的目标是一旦移动就检测并分割对象。由于视频中的随机变化和运动信号的不可靠性，需要多个帧来可靠地检测对象。该方法设计为在误报率受到约束的情况下以最小延迟进行检测和分段。该方法是作为最快变化检测的问题得出的。在数据集上的实验显示了我们的方法在使误报约束条件下的检测延迟最小化方面的有效性。
