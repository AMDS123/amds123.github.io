##### Abstract
Domain adaptation (DA) addresses the real-world image classification problem of discrepancy between training (source) and testing (target) data distributions. We propose an unsupervised DA method that considers the presence of only unlabelled data in the target domain. Our approach centers on finding matches between samples of the source and target domains. The matches are obtained by treating the source and target domains as hyper-graphs and carrying out a class-regularized hyper-graph matching using first-, second- and third-order similarities between the graphs. We have also developed a computationally efficient algorithm by initially selecting a subset of the samples to construct a graph and then developing a customized optimization routine for graph-matching based on Conditional Gradient and Alternating Direction Multiplier Method. This allows the proposed method to be used widely. We also performed a set of experiments on standard object recognition datasets to validate the effectiveness of our framework over state-of-the-art approaches.
