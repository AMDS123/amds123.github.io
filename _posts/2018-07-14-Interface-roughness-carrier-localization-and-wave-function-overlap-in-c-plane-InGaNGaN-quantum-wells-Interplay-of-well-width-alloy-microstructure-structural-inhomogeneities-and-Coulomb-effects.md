##### Abstract
In this work we present a detailed analysis of the interplay of Coulomb effects and different mechanisms that can lead to carrier localization effects in c-plane InGaN/GaN quantum wells. As mechanisms for carrier localization we consider here effects introduced by random alloy fluctuations as well as structural inhomogeneities such as well width fluctuations. Special attention is paid to the impact of the well width on the results. All calculations have been carried out in the framework of atomistic tight-binding theory. Our theoretical investigations show that independent of the here studied well widths, carrier localization effects due to built-in fields, well width fluctuations and random alloy fluctuations dominate over Coulomb effects in terms of charge density redistributions. However, the situation is less clear cut when the well width fluctuations are absent. For large well width (approx. > 2.5 nm) charge density redistributions are possible but the electronic and optical properties are basically dominated by the spatial out-of plane carrier separation originating from the electrostatic built-in field. The situation changes for lower well width (< 2.5 nm) where the Coulomb effect can lead to significant charge density redistributions and thus might compensate a large fraction of the spatial in-plane wave function separation observed in a single-particle picture. Given that this in-plane separation has been regarded as one of the main drivers behind the green gap problem, our calculations indicate that radiative recombination rates might significantly benefit from a reduced quantum well barrier interface roughness.

在这项工作中，我们详细分析了库仑效应和不同机制的相互作用，这些机制可能导致c面InGaN / GaN量子阱中的载流子局域化效应。作为载流子定位的机制，我们在此考虑随机合金波动引起的效应以及诸如井宽波动的结构不均匀性。特别注意井宽对结果的影响。所有的计算都是在原子紧束缚理论的框架下进行的。我们的理论研究表明，独立于此处研究的阱宽度，由于内置场，载波局部化效应，阱宽度波动和随机合金波动在电荷密度重新分布方面优于库仑效应。然而，当没有井宽波动时，情况不太明确。对于大的阱宽（约> 2.5nm），电荷密度重新分布是可能的，但电子和光学性质基本上由源自静电内置场的空间平面外载体分离支配。对于较低的阱宽度（<2.5nm），情况发生变化，其中库仑效应可以导致显着的电荷密度重新分布，因此可以补偿在单粒子图像中观察到的大部分空间面内波函数分离。鉴于这种面内分离被认为是绿色间隙问题背后的主要驱动因素之一，我们的计算表明辐射复合率可能会从量子阱屏障界面粗糙度降低中获益。
