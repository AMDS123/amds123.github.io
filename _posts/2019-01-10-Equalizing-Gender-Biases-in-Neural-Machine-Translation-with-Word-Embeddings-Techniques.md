##### Abstract
Neural machine translation has significantly pushed forward the quality of the field. However, there are remaining big issues with the translations and one of them is fairness. Neural models are trained on large text corpora which contains biases and stereotypes. As a consequence, models inherit these social biases. Recent methods have shown results in reducing gender bias in other natural language processing applications such as word embeddings. We take advantage of the fact that word embeddings are used in neural machine translation to propose the first debiased machine translation system. Specifically, we propose, experiment and analyze the integration of two debiasing techniques over GloVe embeddings in the Transformer translation architecture. We evaluate our proposed system on a generic English-Spanish task, showing gains up to one BLEU point. As for the gender bias evaluation, we generate a test set of occupations and we show that our proposed system learns to equalize existing biases from the baseline system.
