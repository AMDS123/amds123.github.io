##### Abstract
The number and quality of user reviews greatly affects consumer purchasing decisions. While reviews in all languages are increasing, it is still often the case (especially for non-English speakers) that there are only a few reviews in a person's first language. Using an online experiment, we examine the value that potential purchasers receive from interfaces showing additional reviews in a second language. The results paint a complicated picture with both positive and negative reactions to the inclusion of foreign-language reviews. Roughly 26-28% of subjects clicked to see translations of the foreign-language content when given the opportunity, and those who did so were more likely to select the product with foreign-language reviews than those who did not.

用户评论的数量和质量极大地影响了消费者的购买决策。虽然所有语言的评论都在增加，但是对于一个人的第一语言来说，通常情况下（特别是对于非英语的人来说）只有少数评论。使用在线实验，我们检查潜在购买者从界面中获得的价值，显示第二种语言的额外评论。结果画了一幅复杂的画面，对于包含外语评论既有积极的反应，也有消极的反应。在有机会的情况下，大约有26-28％的受试者点击了翻译外语内容，而这样做的人更有可能选择外语评论的产品。
