##### Abstract
This work proposes a feature-based technique to recognize vehicle types within day and night times. Support vector machine (SVM) classifier is applied on image histogram and CENsus Transformed histogRam Oriented Gradient (CENTROG) features in order to classify vehicle types during the day and night. Thermal images were used for the night time experiments. Although thermal images suffer from low image resolution, lack of colour and poor texture information, they offer the advantage of being unaffected by high intensity light sources such as vehicle headlights which tend to render normal images unsuitable for night time image capturing and subsequent analysis. Since contour is useful in shape based categorisation and the most distinctive feature within thermal images, CENTROG is used to capture this feature information and is used within the experiments. The experimental results so obtained were compared with those obtained by employing the CENsus TRansformed hISTogram (CENTRIST). Experimental results revealed that CENTROG offers better recognition accuracies for both day and night times vehicle types recognition.

这项工作提出了一种基于特征的技术来识别在白天和黑夜时间的车辆类型。支持向量机（SVM）分类器被应用在图像直方图和CENSus变换的组方向梯度（CENTROG）特征上，以在白天和晚上分类车辆类型。热图像被用于夜间实验。尽管热图像具有低图像分辨率，缺乏颜色和不良纹理信息，但是它们提供了不受高强度光源如汽车前灯的影响，其倾向于使正常图像不适于夜间图像捕获和随后的分析。由于轮廓在基于形状的分类中是有用的，并且在热图像中是最显着的特征，所以CENTROG被用于捕获这个特征信息并且在实验中被使用。这样获得的实验结果与使用CENsus TRansformed hISTogram（CENTRIST）获得的结果进行比较。实验结果表明，CENTROG提供更好的识别精度，为日夜车辆类型识别。
