##### Abstract
Dictionary learning and sparse representation (DLSR) is a recent and successful mathematical model for data representation that achieves state-of-the-art performance in various fields such as pattern recognition, machine learning, computer vision, and medical imaging. The original formulation for DLSR is based on the minimization of the reconstruction error between the original signal and its sparse representation in the space of the learned dictionary. Although this formulation is optimal for solving problems such as denoising, inpainting, and coding, it may not lead to optimal solution in classification tasks, where the ultimate goal is to make the learned dictionary and corresponding sparse representation as discriminative as possible. This motivated the emergence of a new category of techniques, which is appropriately called supervised dictionary learning and sparse representation (S-DLSR), leading to more optimal dictionary and sparse representation in classification tasks. Despite many research efforts for S-DLSR, the literature lacks a comprehensive view of these techniques, their connections, advantages and shortcomings. In this paper, we address this gap and provide a review of the recently proposed algorithms for S-DLSR. We first present a taxonomy of these algorithms into six categories based on the approach taken to include label information into the learning of the dictionary and/or sparse representation. For each category, we draw connections between the algorithms in this category and present a unified framework for them. We then provide guidelines for applied researchers on how to represent and learn the building blocks of an S-DLSR solution based on the problem at hand. This review provides a broad, yet deep, view of the state-of-the-art methods for S-DLSR and allows for the advancement of research and development in this emerging area of research.

字典学习和稀疏表示（DLSR）是最近成功的数据表示的数学模型，在模式识别，机器学习，计算机视觉和医学成像等各个领域实现了最先进的性能。 DLSR的原始公式是基于原始信号与其在学习字典的空间中的稀疏表示之间的重构误差的最小化。尽管这个公式对于解决诸如去噪，修补和编码等问题是最优的，但是在分类任务中可能不会导致最佳的解决方案，其最终目的是使学习的字典和相应的稀疏表示尽可能地具有区分性。这促使了一类新的技术的出现，这种技术被适当地称为有监督的字典学习和稀疏表示（S-DLSR），导致在分类任务中更优化的字典和稀疏表示。尽管在S-DLSR方面进行了大量的研究工作，但文献却缺乏对这些技术及其联系，优点和缺点的全面认识。在本文中，我们解决了这个差距，并提供了最近提出的S-DLSR算法的综述。我们首先基于将标签信息包括到词典学习和/或稀疏表示中的方法，将这些算法的分类法分为六类。对于每个类别，我们在这个类别的算法之间绘制连接并为它们提供一个统一的框架。然后，我们为应用研究人员提供指导，帮助他们根据手头的问题来表达和学习S-DLSR解决方案的构建模块。本综述提供了对S-DLSR最先进方法的广泛而深入的认识，并有助于在这一新兴研究领域推动研究和发展。
