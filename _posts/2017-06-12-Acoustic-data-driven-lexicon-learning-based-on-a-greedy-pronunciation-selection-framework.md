##### Abstract
Speech recognition systems for irregularly-spelled languages like English normally require hand-written pronunciations. In this paper, we describe a system for automatically obtaining pronunciations of words for which pronunciations are not available, but for which transcribed data exists. Our method integrates information from the letter sequence and from the acoustic evidence. The novel aspect of the problem that we address is the problem of how to prune entries from such a lexicon (since, empirically, lexicons with too many entries do not tend to be good for ASR performance). Experiments on various ASR tasks show that, with the proposed framework, starting with an initial lexicon of several thousand words, we are able to learn a lexicon which performs close to a full expert lexicon in terms of WER performance on test data, and is better than lexicons built using G2P alone or with a pruning criterion based on pronunciation probability.

英语等不规则拼写的语言的语音识别系统通常需要手写的发音。在本文中，我们描述了一个系统，用于自动获取发音不可用，但是存在转录数据的单词的发音。我们的方法整合了来自字母序列和声学证据的信息。我们所处理的问题的新颖方面是如何从这样一个词典中删除条目的问题（因为实际上，条目太多的词典对ASR性能不利。在各种ASR任务上的实验表明，在所提出的框架下，从几千字的初始词典开始，我们能够学习在测试数据上WER性能方面接近完整专家词典的词典，并且更好而不是单独使用G2P构建的词典或基于发音概率的修剪标准。
