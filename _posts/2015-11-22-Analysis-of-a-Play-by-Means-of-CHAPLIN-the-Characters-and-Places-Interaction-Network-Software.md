##### Abstract
Recently, we have developed a software able of gathering information on social networks from written texts. This software, the CHAracters and PLaces Interaction Network (CHAPLIN) tool, is implemented in Visual Basic. By means of it, characters and places of a literary work can be extracted from a list of raw words. The software interface helps users to select their names out of this list. Setting some parameters, CHAPLIN creates a network where nodes represent characters/places and edges give their interactions. Nodes and edges are labelled by performances. In this paper, we propose to use CHAPLIN for the analysis a William Shakespeare's play, the famous 'Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark'. Performances of characters in the play as a whole and in each act of it are given by graphs.

最近，我们开发了一种能够从书面文本中收集社交网络信息的软件。该软件是CHAracters和PLaces交互网络（CHAPLIN）工具，在Visual Basic中实现。通过这种方式，可以从原始单词列表中提取文学作品的人物和地点。软件界面帮助用户从列表中选择他们的名字。设置一些参数，CHAPLIN创建一个网络，其中节点代表字符/地点和边缘给他们的互动。节点和边缘由性能标记。在本文中，我们建议用CHAPLIN来分析一个威廉·莎士比亚的剧作，着名的“丹麦王子哈姆雷特的悲剧”。剧中人物的表演整体以及每一个动作都是由图表给出的。
