##### Abstract
To realize the full spectrum of advantages that GaN materials system offers, demonstration of p-GaN based devices is valuable. Authors report the first p-field effect transistor (pFET) based on AlGaN/GaN superlattice (SL) grown using MOCVD. Magnesium was used to dope the material in the superlattice. Lowest sheet resistance of 10 k{\Omega}/sq was achieved for doping of 1.5e+19 cm^-3 of Mg (determined by SIMS). Mobility in the range of 7-10 cm^2/Vs and total sheet charge density in the range of 1e+13- 6e+13 cm^-2 were measured. The device had a maximum drain-source current (IDS) of 3mA/mm and On-Resistance (RON) of 3.48k{\Omega}.mm.
