##### Abstract
Epitaxy of semiconductors is a process of tremendous importance in applied science and optoelectronic industry. Controlling of defects introduced during epitaxial growth is a key point in manufacturing devices of high efficiency and durability. In this work, we demonstrate how useful hybrid reflections are on the study of epitaxial structures with anisotropic strain gradients due to patterned substrates. High accuracy to detect and distinguish elastic and plastic relaxations are one of the greatest advantages of measuring this type of reflection, as well as the fact that it can be exploited in symmetrical reflection geometry on a commercial high-resolution diffractometer.
