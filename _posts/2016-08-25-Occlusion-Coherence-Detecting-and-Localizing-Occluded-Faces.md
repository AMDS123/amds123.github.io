##### Abstract
The presence of occluders significantly impacts object recognition accuracy. However, occlusion is typically treated as an unstructured source of noise and explicit models for occluders have lagged behind those for object appearance and shape. In this paper we describe a hierarchical deformable part model for face detection and landmark localization that explicitly models part occlusion. The proposed model structure makes it possible to augment positive training data with large numbers of synthetically occluded instances. This allows us to easily incorporate the statistics of occlusion patterns in a discriminatively trained model. We test the model on several benchmarks for landmark localization and detection including challenging new data sets featuring significant occlusion. We find that the addition of an explicit occlusion model yields a detection system that outperforms existing approaches for occluded instances while maintaining competitive accuracy in detection and landmark localization for unoccluded instances.

封堵器的存在显着影响物体识别的准确性。然而，闭塞通常被视为非结构化的噪声源，闭塞物的显式模型已经落后于物体外观和形状的模型。在本文中，我们描述了一个用于人脸检测和地标定位的层次可变形部分模型，明确地模拟部分遮挡。所提出的模型结构使得可以用大量的合成闭塞实例来增加正面的训练数据。这使得我们可以很容易地将遮挡模式的统计结果纳入一个有区别的训练模型中。我们在地标定位和检测的几个基准测试模型，包括具有重大阻塞的具有挑战性的新数据集。我们发现，增加一个明确的遮挡模型会产生一个检测系统，该检测系统在被遮挡的实例中优于现有的方法，同时在未被遮挡的实例中保持检测和地标本地化的竞争精度。
