##### Abstract
Current advances in machine translation increase the need for translators to switch from traditional translation to post-editing of machine-translated text, a process that saves time and improves quality. Human and artificial intelligence need to be integrated in an efficient way to leverage the advantages of both for the translation task. This paper outlines approaches at this boundary of AI and HCI and discusses open research questions to further advance the field.
