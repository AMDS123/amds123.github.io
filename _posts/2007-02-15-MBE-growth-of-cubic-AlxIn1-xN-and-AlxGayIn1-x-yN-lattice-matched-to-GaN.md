##### Abstract
Ternary and quaternary cubic c-AlxIn1-xN/GaN and c-AlxGayIn1-x-y/GaN heterostructures lattice-matched to c-GaN on freestanding 3C-SiC substrates were grown by plasma-assisted molecular beam epitaxy. The c-AlxGayIn1-x-y alloy permits the independent control of band gap and lattice parameter. The ternary and quaternary films were grown at 620 C. Different alloy compositions were obtained by varying the Al and Ga fluxes. The alloy composition was measured by Energy Dispersive X-ray Spectroscopy (EDX) and Rutherford Backscattering Spectrometry (RBS). X-ray reciprocal space map of asymmetric (-1-13) reflex were used to measure the lattice parameters and to verify the lattice match between the alloy and the c-GaN buffer.
