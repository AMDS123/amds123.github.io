##### Abstract
The increasing illegal parking has become more and more serious. Nowadays the methods of detecting illegally parked vehicles are based on background segmentation. However, this method is weakly robust and sensitive to environment. Benefitting from deep learning, this paper proposes a novel illegal vehicle parking detection system. Illegal vehicles captured by camera are firstly located and classified by the famous Single Shot MultiBox Detector (SSD) algorithm. To improve the performance, we propose to optimize SSD by adjusting the aspect ratio of default box to accommodate with our dataset better. After that, a tracking and analysis of movement is adopted to judge the illegal vehicles in the region of interest (ROI). Experiments show that the system can achieve a 99% accuracy and real-time (25FPS) detection with strong robustness in complex environments.

越来越多的违法停车越来越严重。目前，非法停放车辆的检测方法是基于背景分割的。但是，这种方法对于环境来说是弱健壮性和敏感性的。本文从深度学习的角度出发，提出了一种新型的非法停车检测系统。相机捕获的非法车辆首先由着名的单发多框检测器（SSD）算法进行定位和分类。为了提高性能，我们建议通过调整默认盒子的长宽比以更好地适应我们的数据集来优化SSD。之后，通过追踪和分析运动来判断感兴趣区域（ROI）的非法车辆。实验表明，该系统可以在复杂环境下实现99％的精度和实时（25FPS）检测，具有较强的鲁棒性。
