##### Abstract
Generic Ontology Design Patterns, GODPs, are defined in Generic DOL, an extension of DOL, the Distributed Ontology, Model and Specification Language, and implemented using Heterogeneous Tool Set. 
 Parameters such as classes, properties, individuals, or whole ontologies may be instantiated with arguments in a host ontology. The potential of Generic DOL is illustrated with GODPs for an example from the literature, namely the Role design pattern. We also discuss how larger GODPs may be composed by instantiating smaller GODPs.
