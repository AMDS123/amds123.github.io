##### Abstract
Developing visual perception models for active agents and sensorimotor control are cumbersome to be done in the physical world, as existing algorithms are too slow to efficiently learn in real-time and robots are fragile and costly. This has given rise to learning-in-simulation which consequently casts a question on whether the results transfer to real-world. In this paper, we are concerned with the problem of developing real-world perception for active agents, propose Gibson Virtual Environment for this purpose, and showcase sample perceptual tasks learned therein. Gibson is based on virtualizing real spaces, rather than using artificially designed ones, and currently includes over 1400 floor spaces from 572 full buildings. The main characteristics of Gibson are: I. being from the real-world and reflecting its semantic complexity, II. having an internal synthesis mechanism, "Goggles", enabling deploying the trained models in real-world without needing further domain adaptation, III. embodiment of agents and making them subject to constraints of physics and space.

在物理世界中开发用于活动代理和感知运动控制的视觉感知模型是麻烦的，因为现有算法太慢而不能实时有效地学习并且机器人是脆弱且昂贵的。这导致了模拟学习，因此对结果是否转移到现实世界提出了疑问。在本文中，我们关注为活跃的代理开发真实世界的感知问题，为此目的提出Gibson虚拟环境，并展示其中学习的样本感知任务。 Gibson基于虚拟化真实空间，而不是使用人工设计的空间，目前包括来自572个完整建筑的1400多个楼层空间。 Gibson的主要特征是：I。来自现实世界并反映其语义复杂性，II。具有内部合成机制“Goggles”，可以在现实世界中部署训练好的模型，而无需进一步的域适应，III。代理人的体现，使他们受到物理和空间的限制。
