##### Abstract
We propose a simple Named Entity Linking system that can be trained from Wikidata only. This demonstrates the strengths and weaknesses of this data source for this task and provides an easily reproducible baseline to compare other systems against. Our model is lightweight to train, to run and to keep synchronous with Wikidata in real time.
