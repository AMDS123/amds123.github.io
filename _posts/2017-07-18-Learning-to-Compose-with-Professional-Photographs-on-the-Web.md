##### Abstract
Photo composition is an important factor affecting the aesthetics in photography. However, it is a highly challenging task to model the aesthetic properties of good compositions due to the lack of globally applicable rules to the wide variety of photographic styles. Inspired by the thinking process of photo taking, we formulate the photo composition problem as a view finding process which successively examines pairs of views and determines their aesthetic preferences. We further exploit the rich professional photographs on the web to mine unlimited high-quality ranking samples and demonstrate that an aesthetics-aware deep ranking network can be trained without explicitly modeling any photographic rules. The resulting model is simple and effective in terms of its architectural design and data sampling method. It is also generic since it naturally learns any photographic rules implicitly encoded in professional photographs. The experiments show that the proposed view finding network achieves state-of-the-art performance with sliding window search strategy on two image cropping datasets.

照片构图是影响摄影美学的重要因素。然而，由于对各种各样的照相风格缺乏全球适用的规则，对良好作品的美学特性进行建模是一项非常具有挑战性的任务。受照片拍摄的思考过程的启发，我们将照片构图问题作为一个查看过程，逐步检查视图对，确定其审美偏好。我们进一步利用网络上丰富的专业照片来挖掘无限高质量的排名样本，并证明可以在没有明确建模任何摄影规则的情况下训练具有美学意义的深度排名网络。所得到的模型在架构设计和数据采样方法上是简单而有效的。这也是通用的，因为它自然地学习了在专业照片中隐含编码的任何照相规则。实验表明，所提出的查找网络在两个图像裁剪数据集上实现了滑动窗口搜索策略的最新性能。
