##### Abstract
In this paper, we propose a spoofing detection system for replay attack using replay noise. In many previous studies across various domains, noise has been reduced. However, in replay attack, we hypothesize that noise is the prominent feature which is different with original signal and it can be one of the keys to find whether a signal has been spoofed. We define the noise that is caused by the replay attack as replay noise. Specifically, the noise of playback devices, recording environments, and recording devices, is included in the replay noise. We explore the effectiveness of training a deep neural network simultaneously for replay attack spoofing detection and replay noise classification. Multi-task learning was exploited to embed spoofing detection and replay noise classification in the code layer. The experiment results on the ASVspoof2017 datasets demonstrate that the performance of our proposed system is relatively improved 30% on the evaluation set.

在本文中，我们提出了一种使用重放噪声进行重放攻击的欺骗检测系统。在之前许多领域的研究中，噪音已经减少。然而，在重放攻击中，我们假设噪声是与原始信号不同的突出特征，并且它可以是发现信号是否被欺骗的关键之一。我们将重放攻击引起的噪声定义为重放噪声。具体地，重放设备，记录环境和记录设备的噪声包括在重放噪声中。我们探讨了同时训练深度神经网络对重放攻击欺骗检测和重放噪声分类的有效性。利用多任务学习在代码层中嵌入欺骗检测和重放噪声分类。 ASVspoof2017数据集的实验结果表明，我们提出的系统的性能在评估集上相对提高了30％。
