##### Abstract
Sparse coding (SC) is attracting more and more attention due to its comprehensive theoretical studies and its excellent performance in many signal processing applications. However, most existing sparse coding algorithms are nonconvex and are thus prone to becoming stuck into bad local minima, especially when there are outliers and noisy data. To enhance the learning robustness, in this paper, we propose a unified framework named Self-Paced Sparse Coding (SPSC), which gradually include matrix elements into SC learning from easy to complex. We also generalize the self-paced learning schema into different levels of dynamic selection on samples, features and elements respectively. Experimental results on real-world data demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed algorithms.

稀疏编码（SC）由于其全面的理论研究和在许多信号处理应用中的优异性能而受到越来越多的关注。然而，大多数现有的稀疏编码算法都是非凸的，因此容易陷入局部最小的极小值，特别是当存在异常值和噪声数据时。为了提高学习的鲁棒性，本文提出了一个名为自适应稀疏编码（SPSC）的统一框架，它将矩阵元素逐步纳入到SC学习中，从简单到复杂。我们也将自学的学习方案分别推广到样本，特征和元素的不同层次上。实际数据的实验结果证明了所提出算法的有效性。
