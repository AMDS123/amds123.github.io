##### Abstract
This paper presents two visual trackers from the different paradigms of learning and registration based tracking and evaluates their application in image based visual servoing. They can track object motion with four degrees of freedom (DoF) which, as we will show here, is sufficient for many fine manipulation tasks. One of these trackers is a newly developed learning based tracker that relies on learning discriminative correlation filters while the other is a refinement of a recent 8 DoF RANSAC based tracker adapted with a new appearance model for tracking 4 DoF motion. Both trackers are shown to provide superior performance to several state of the art trackers on an existing dataset for manipulation tasks. Further, a new dataset with challenging sequences for fine manipulation tasks captured from robot mounted eye-in-hand (EIH) cameras is also presented. These sequences have a variety of challenges encountered during real tasks including jittery camera movement, motion blur, drastic scale changes and partial occlusions. Quantitative and qualitative results on these sequences are used to show that these two trackers are robust to failures while providing high precision that makes them suitable for such fine manipulation tasks.

本文提出了两种不同的基于学习和注册的跟踪范式的视觉跟踪器，并评估它们在基于图像的视觉伺服中的应用。他们可以用四个自由度（DoF）跟踪物体运动，正如我们在这里所展示的那样，这对于许多精细的操作任务来说是足够的。其中一个跟踪器是一个新开发的基于学习的跟踪器，依赖于学习鉴别相关滤波器，而另一个是对最近8个基于DoF RANSAC的跟踪器的改进，适用于跟踪4个DoF运动的新外观模型。两个跟踪器都被显示为在现有的用于操纵任务的数据集上的几个现有技术跟踪器提供优越的性能。此外，还提供了一个新的数据集，具有挑战性的序列，从机器人手持式（EIH）相机捕获的精细操作任务。这些序列在实际任务中遇到了各种挑战，包括抖动相机移动，运动模糊，剧烈的尺度变化和部分遮挡。使用这些序列的定量和定性结果来显示这两个跟踪器对故障稳健，同时提供高精度，使其适合于这样的精细操作任务。
