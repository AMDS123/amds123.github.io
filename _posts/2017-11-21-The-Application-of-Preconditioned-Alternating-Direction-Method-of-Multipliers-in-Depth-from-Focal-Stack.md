##### Abstract
Post capture refocusing effect in smartphone cameras is achievable by using focal stacks. However, the accuracy of this effect is totally dependent on the combination of the depth layers in the stack. The accuracy of the extended depth of field effect in this application can be improved significantly by computing an accurate depth map which has been an open issue for decades. To tackle this issue, in this paper, a framework is proposed based on Preconditioned Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (PADMM) for depth from the focal stack and synthetic defocus application. In addition to its ability to provide high structural accuracy and occlusion handling, the optimization function of the proposed method can, in fact, converge faster and better than state of the art methods. The evaluation has been done on 21 sets of focal stacks and the optimization function has been compared against 5 other methods. Preliminary results indicate that the proposed method has a better performance in terms of structural accuracy and optimization in comparison to the current state of the art methods.

通过使用焦点堆栈，可以在智能手机相机中实现拍摄后重新聚焦效果。但是，这种效果的准确性完全取决于堆栈中深度层的组合。通过计算几十年来一直存在的公开问题的准确深度图，可以显着提高此应用中扩展景深效应的准确性。针对这一问题，本文提出了一种基于预处理交替方向乘法器（PADMM）的焦点叠加和合成散焦应用框架。除了提供高结构精度和遮挡处理的能力之外，所提出的方法的优化功能实际上可以比现有技术的方法更快且更好地收敛。已经对21组焦点叠加进行了评估，并将优化函数与其他5种方法进行了比较。初步结果表明，与现有技术方法相比，所提出的方法在结构精度和优化方面具有更好的性能。
