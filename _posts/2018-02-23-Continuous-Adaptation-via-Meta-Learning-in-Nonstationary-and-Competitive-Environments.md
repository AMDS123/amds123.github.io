##### Abstract
Ability to continuously learn and adapt from limited experience in nonstationary environments is an important milestone on the path towards general intelligence. In this paper, we cast the problem of continuous adaptation into the learning-to-learn framework. We develop a simple gradient-based meta-learning algorithm suitable for adaptation in dynamically changing and adversarial scenarios. Additionally, we design a new multi-agent competitive environment, RoboSumo, and define iterated adaptation games for testing various aspects of continuous adaptation strategies. We demonstrate that meta-learning enables significantly more efficient adaptation than reactive baselines in the few-shot regime. Our experiments with a population of agents that learn and compete suggest that meta-learners are the fittest.

不断学习和适应有限的非稳态环境经验是实现一般智能的重要里程碑。在本文中，我们将持续适应问题转化为学习学习框架。我们开发了一个简单的基于梯度的元学习算法，适合在动态变化和敌对情况下适应。另外，我们设计了一个新的多智能体竞争环境RoboSumo，并定义了迭代适应性游戏来测试连续适应策略的各个方面。我们证明，元数学习能够比反应式基线在少数情况下显着更有效的适应。我们对一群学习和竞争的代理人进行的实验表明，元学习者是最适合的。
