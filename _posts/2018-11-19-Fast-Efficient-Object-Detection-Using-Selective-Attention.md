##### Abstract
Deep learning object detectors achieve state-of-the-art accuracy at the expense of high computational overheads, impeding their utilization on embedded systems such as drones. A primary source of these overheads is the exhaustive classification of typically 10^4-10^5 regions per image. Given that most of these regions contain uninformative background, the detector designs seem extremely superfluous and inefficient. In contrast, biological vision systems leverage selective attention for fast and efficient object detection. Recent neuroscientific findings shedding new light on the mechanism behind selective attention allowed us to formulate a new hypothesis of object detection efficiency and subsequently introduce a new object detection paradigm. To that end, we leverage this knowledge to design a novel region proposal network and empirically show that it achieves high object detection performance on the COCO dataset. Moreover, the model uses two to three orders of magnitude fewer computations than state-of-the-art models and consequently achieves inference speeds exceeding 500 frames/s, thereby making it possible to achieve object detection on embedded systems.
