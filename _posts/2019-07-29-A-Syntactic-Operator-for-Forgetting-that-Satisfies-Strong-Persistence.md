##### Abstract
Whereas the operation of forgetting has recently seen a considerable amount of attention in the context of Answer Set Programming (ASP), most of it has focused on theoretical aspects, leaving the practical issues largely untouched. Recent studies include results about what sets of properties operators should satisfy, as well as the abstract characterization of several operators and their theoretical limits. However, no concrete operators have been investigated. 
 In this paper, we address this issue by presenting the first concrete operator that satisfies strong persistence - a property that seems to best capture the essence of forgetting in the context of ASP - whenever this is possible, and many other important properties. The operator is syntactic, limiting the computation of the forgetting result to manipulating the rules in which the atoms to be forgotten occur, naturally yielding a forgetting result that is close to the original program. 
 This paper is under consideration for acceptance in TPLP.
