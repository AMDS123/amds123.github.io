##### Abstract
We propose to quantify the effect of sensor and actuator uncertainties on the control of the center of mass and center of pressure in legged robots, since this is central for maintaining their balance with a limited support polygon. Our approach is based on robust control theory, considering uncertainties that can take any value between specified bounds. This provides a principled approach to deciding optimal feedback gains. Surprisingly, our main observation is that the sampling period can be as long as 200 ms with literally no impact on maximum tracking error and, as a result, on the guarantee that balance can be maintained safely. Our findings are validated in simulations and experiments with the torque-controlled humanoid robot Toro developed at DLR. The proposed mathematical derivations and results apply nevertheless equally to biped and quadruped robots.
