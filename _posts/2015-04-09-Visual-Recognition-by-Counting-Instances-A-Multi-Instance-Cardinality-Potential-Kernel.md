##### Abstract
Many visual recognition problems can be approached by counting instances. To determine whether an event is present in a long internet video, one could count how many frames seem to contain the activity. Classifying the activity of a group of people can be done by counting the actions of individual people. Encoding these cardinality relationships can reduce sensitivity to clutter, in the form of irrelevant frames or individuals not involved in a group activity. Learned parameters can encode how many instances tend to occur in a class of interest. To this end, this paper develops a powerful and flexible framework to infer any cardinality relation between latent labels in a multi-instance model. Hard or soft cardinality relations can be encoded to tackle diverse levels of ambiguity. Experiments on tasks such as human activity recognition, video event detection, and video summarization demonstrate the effectiveness of using cardinality relations for improving recognition results.

##### Abstract (translated by Google)
许多视觉识别问题可以通过计数实例来处理。为了确定一个事件是否存在于一个长的互联网视频中，可以计算出似乎包含该活动的帧数。对一组人的活动进行分类可以通过计算个人的行为来完成。对这些基数关系进行编码可以降低对混乱的敏感度，以不相关的框架或不参与群体活动的个人的形式出现。学过的参数可以编码在一个感兴趣的类中往往会出现多少个实例。为此，本文开发了一个强大而灵活的框架来推断多实例模型中潜在标签之间的任意基数关系。硬或软的基数关系可以被编码以处理不同程度的模糊性。人类活动识别，视频事件检测和视频摘要等任务的实验证明了使用基数关系提高识别结果的有效性。
