##### Abstract
We consider the problem of separating speech sources captured by multiple spatially separated devices, each of which has multiple microphones and samples its signals at a slightly different rate. Most asynchronous array processing methods rely on sample rate offset estimation and resampling, but these offsets can be difficult to estimate if the sources or microphones are moving. We propose a source separation method that does not require offset estimation or signal resampling. Instead, we divide the distributed array into several synchronous subarrays. All arrays are used jointly to estimate the time-varying signal statistics, and those statistics are used to design separate time-varying spatial filters in each array. We demonstrate the method for speech mixtures recorded on both stationary and moving microphone arrays.

我们考虑分离由多个空间分离设备捕获的语音源的问题，每个设备具有多个麦克风并以稍微不同的速率对其信号进行采样。大多数异步阵列处理方法依赖于采样率偏移估计和重采样，但是如果源或麦克风正在移动，则难以估计这些偏移。我们提出了一种不需要偏移估计或信号重采样的源分离方法。相反，我们将分布式数组划分为几个同步子数组。所有阵列共同用于估计时变信号统计，并且这些统计用于在每个阵列中设计单独的时变空间滤波器。我们演示了在静止和移动麦克风阵列上记录的语音混合的方法。
