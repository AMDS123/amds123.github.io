##### Abstract
Persistent surveillance from camera networks, such as at parking lots, UAVs, etc., often results in large amounts of video data, resulting in significant challenges for inference in terms of storage, communication and computation. Compressive cameras have emerged as a potential solution to deal with the data deluge issues in such applications. However, inference tasks such as action recognition require high quality features which implies reconstructing the original video data. Much work in compressive sensing (CS) theory is geared towards solving the reconstruction problem, where state-of-the-art methods are computationally intensive and provide low-quality results at high compression rates. Thus, reconstruction-free methods for inference are much desired. In this paper, we propose reconstruction-free methods for action recognition from compressive cameras at high compression ratios of 100 and above. Recognizing actions directly from CS measurements requires features which are mostly nonlinear and thus not easily applicable. This leads us to search for such properties that are preserved in compressive measurements. To this end, we propose the use of spatio-temporal smashed filters, which are compressive domain versions of pixel-domain matched filters. We conduct experiments on publicly available databases and show that one can obtain recognition rates that are comparable to the oracle method in uncompressed setup, even for high compression ratios.

来自摄像机网络（例如停车场，无人机等）的持续监视通常会导致大量的视频数据，从而导致在存储，通信和计算方面的重要挑战。压缩相机已经成为解决这些应用中的数据洪水问题的潜在解决方案。然而，动作识别等推理任务需要高质量的特征，这意味着重建原始视频数据。压缩感知（CS）理论的许多工作都是为了解决重建问题，其中最先进的方法是计算密集型的并且在高压缩率下提供低质量的结果。因此，非重建的推理方法是非常需要的。在本文中，我们提出了无压缩相机在100以上高压缩比情况下的无重建方法。直接从CS测量中识别动作需要非线性的特征，因此不容易适用。这导致我们搜索在压缩测量中保存的这种性质。为此，我们提出使用时空捣过滤器，它是压缩域版本的像素域匹配滤波器。我们在公开可用的数据库上进行实验，结果表明，即使对于高压缩比，也可以获得与未压缩设置中的oracle方法相当的识别率。
