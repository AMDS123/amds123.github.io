##### Abstract
Osteoporosis can be identified by looking at 2D x-ray images of the bone. The high degree of similarity between images of a healthy bone and a diseased one makes classification a challenge. A good bone texture characterization technique is essential for identifying osteoporosis cases. Standard texture feature extraction techniques like Local Binary Pattern (LBP), Gray Level Co-occurrence Matrix (GLCM) have been used for this purpose. In this paper, we draw a comparison between deep features extracted from convolution neural network against these traditional features. Our results show that deep features have more discriminative power as classifiers trained on them always outperform the ones trained on traditional features.

骨质疏松症可以通过观察骨骼的二维X射线图像来确定。健康骨骼和患病骨骼图像之间的高度相似性使分类成为一个挑战。良好的骨骼质地表征技术对鉴定骨质疏松症病例至关重要。标准的纹理特征提取技术，如局部二值模式（LBP），灰度共生矩阵（GLCM）已被用于此目的。在本文中，我们将卷积神经网络提取的深度特征与这些传统特征进行比较。我们的研究结果表明，深层特征具有更强的辨别力，因为训练过的分类器总是胜过传统特征训练的分类器。
