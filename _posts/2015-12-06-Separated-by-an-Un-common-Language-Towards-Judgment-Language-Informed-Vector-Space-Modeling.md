##### Abstract
A common evaluation practice in the vector space models (VSMs) literature is to measure the models' ability to predict human judgments about lexical semantic relations between word pairs. Most existing evaluation sets, however, consist of scores collected for English word pairs only, ignoring the potential impact of the judgment language in which word pairs are presented on the human scores. In this paper we translate two prominent evaluation sets, wordsim353 (association) and SimLex999 (similarity), from English to Italian, German and Russian and collect scores for each dataset from crowdworkers fluent in its language. Our analysis reveals that human judgments are strongly impacted by the judgment language. Moreover, we show that the predictions of monolingual VSMs do not necessarily best correlate with human judgments made with the language used for model training, suggesting that models and humans are affected differently by the language they use when making semantic judgments. Finally, we show that in a large number of setups, multilingual VSM combination results in improved correlations with human judgments, suggesting that multilingualism may partially compensate for the judgment language effect on human judgments.

##### Abstract (translated by Google)
矢量空间模型（VSM）文献中常见的评估实践是测量模型预测人类对词对之间词汇语义关系判断的能力。然而，大多数现有的评估集只包含仅为英语单词对收集的分数，忽略了将单词对呈现在人类分数上的判断语言的潜在影响。在本文中，我们将英语翻译成意大利语，德语和俄罗斯两个着名的评估集，单词im353（关联）和SimLex999（相似度），并收集每个数据集的语言流利的每个数据集的分数。我们的分析表明，人的判断受判断语言的强烈影响。此外，我们表明，单语VSMs的预测不一定与用于模型训练的语言做出的人类判断最相关，这表明模型和人类在语义判断时受到不同语言的影响。最后，我们展示了在大量的设置中，多语言VSM组合结果与人类判断的相关性得到了改善，这表明多语言可能部分地补偿判断语言对人类判断的影响。
