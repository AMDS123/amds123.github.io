##### Abstract
Artificial Intelligence is an excellent tool to improve efficiency and lower cost in many quantitative real world applications, but what if the task is not easily defined? What if the task is generating creativity? Poetry is a creative endeavor that is highly difficult to both grasp and achieve with any level of competence. As Rita Dove, a famous American poet and author states, "Poetry is language at its most distilled and most powerful." Taking Doves quote as an inspiration, our task was to generate high quality haikus using artificial intelligence and deep learning.
