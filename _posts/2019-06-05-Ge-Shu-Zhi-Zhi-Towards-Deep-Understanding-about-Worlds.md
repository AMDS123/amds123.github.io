##### Abstract
"Ge She Zhi Zhi" is a novel saying in Chinese, stated as "To investigate things from the underlying principle(s) and to acquire knowledge in the form of mathematical representations". The saying is adopted and modified based on the ideas from the Eastern and Western philosophers. This position paper discusses the saying in the background of artificial intelligence (AI). Some related subjects, such as the ultimate goals of AI and two levels of knowledge representations, are discussed from the perspective of machine learning. A case study on objective evaluations over multi attributes, a typical problem in the filed of social computing, is given to support the saying for wide applications. A methodology of meta rules is proposed for examining the objectiveness of the evaluations. The possible problems of the saying are also presented.
