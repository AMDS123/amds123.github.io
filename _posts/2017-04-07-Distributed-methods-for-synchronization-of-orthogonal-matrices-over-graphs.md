##### Abstract
This paper addresses the problem of synchronizing orthogonal matrices over directed graphs. For synchronized transformations (or matrices), composite transformations over loops equal the identity. We formulate the synchronization problem as a least-squares optimization problem with nonlinear constraints. The synchronization problem appears as one of the key components in applications ranging from 3D-localization to image registration. The main contributions of this work can be summarized as the introduction of two novel algorithms; one for symmetric graphs and one for graphs that are possibly asymmetric. Under general conditions, the former has guaranteed convergence to the solution of a spectral relaxation to the synchronization problem. The latter is stable for small step sizes when the graph is quasi-strongly connected. The proposed methods are verified in numerical simulations.

##### Abstract (translated by Google)
本文讨论了在有向图上同步正交矩阵的问题。对于同步转换（或矩阵），循环上的复合转换等于标识。我们将同步问题作为一个带有非线性约束的最小二乘优化问题。同步问题显示为从3D定位到图像配准的应用中的关键组件之一。这项工作的主要贡献可以概括为两个新算法的介绍;一个用于对称图，另一个用于可能不对称的图。在一般条件下，前者已经保证了向谱同步问题解的收敛性。当图形准连接时，后者对于小步长是稳定的。所提出的方法在数值模拟中被验证。
