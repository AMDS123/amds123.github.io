##### Abstract
In this paper, we present a new approach to learning for motion planning (MP) where critical regions of an environment with low probability measure are learned from a given set of motion plans and used to improve performance on new problem instances. We show that convolutional neural networks (CNN) can be used to identify critical regions for motion planning problems. We also introduce a new sampling-based motion planner, Learn and Link. Our planner leverages critical region locations identified by our CNN to overcome the limitations of uniform sampling, while still maintaining guarantees of correctness inherent to sampling-based algorithms. We evaluate Learn and Link against planners from the Open Motion Planning Library (OMPL) using an extensive suite of experiments on challenging navigation planning problems. We show that our approach requires far less planning time than the existing sampling-based planners.
