##### Abstract
Online symptom checkers have significant potential to improve patient care, however their reliability and accuracy remain variable. We hypothesised that an artificial intelligence (AI) powered triage and diagnostic system would compare favourably with human doctors with respect to triage and diagnostic accuracy. We performed a prospective validation study of the accuracy and safety of an AI powered triage and diagnostic system. Identical cases were evaluated by both an AI system and human doctors. Differential diagnoses and triage outcomes were evaluated by an independent judge, who was blinded from knowing the source (AI system or human doctor) of the outcomes. Independently of these cases, vignettes from publicly available resources were also assessed to provide a benchmark to previous studies and the diagnostic component of the MRCGP exam. Overall we found that the Babylon AI powered Triage and Diagnostic System was able to identify the condition modelled by a clinical vignette with accuracy comparable to human doctors (in terms of precision and recall). In addition, we found that the triage advice recommended by the AI System was, on average, safer than that of human doctors, when compared to the ranges of acceptable triage provided by independent expert judges, with only a minimal reduction in appropriateness.

在线症状检查有改善患者护理的重大潜力，但其可靠性和准确性仍然可变。我们假设人工智能（AI）动力分诊和诊断系统在分类​​和诊断准确性方面与人类医生相比有优势。我们对AI动力分诊和诊断系统的准确性和安全性进行了前瞻性验证研究。同一个案例由AI系统和人类医生进行评估。鉴别诊断和分流结果由独立法官评估，该法官不知道结果的来源（AI系统或人类医生）。独立于这些案例，还对公开可用资源的内容进行了评估，为以前的研究和MRCGP考试的诊断组件提供了基准。总体而言，我们发现巴比伦AI动力分诊和诊断系统能够识别临床小样的模型，其准确性与人类医生相当（在精确度和召回率方面）。此外，我们发现，与独立专家法官提供的可接受的分类范围相比，AI系统建议的分类建议平均比人类医生的分类建议安全，只是适当性降低很少。
