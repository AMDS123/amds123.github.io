##### Abstract
In the last three decades, human visual attention has been a topic of great interest in various disciplines. In computer vision, many models have been proposed to predict the distribution of human fixations on a visual input. Recently, thanks to the creation of large collections of data, machine learning algorithms have obtained state-of-the-art performance on the task of saliency map estimation. On the other hand, computational models of scanpath are much less studied. Works are often only descriptive or task specific. Computational models of scanpath with general purpose are present in the literature, but are then evaluated in tasks of saliency prediction, losing therefore information about the dynamics and the behaviour. This is due to the fact that the scanpath is harder to model because it must include the description of a dynamic. In addition to the difficulty of the problem itself, two technical reasons have limited the research. The first reason is the lack of robust and uniformly used set of metrics to compare the similarity between scanpath. The second reason is the lack of sufficiently large and varied scanpath datasets. In this report we want to help in both directions. We present FixaTons, a large collection of human scanpaths (and saliency maps). It comes along with a software library for easy data usage, statistics calculation and measures for scanpaths (and saliency maps) similarity.

在过去的三十年中，人类的视觉注意力一直是各学科极感兴趣的话题。在计算机视觉中，已经提出了许多模型来预测视觉输入上人类注意的分布。最近，由于创建了大量的数据，机器学习算法已经获得了显着图估计任务的最新性能。另一方面，扫描路径的计算模型的研究较少。作品往往只是描述性或特定的任务。文献中给出了具有一般用途的扫描路径的计算模型，然后在显着性预测的任务中对其进行评估，因此丢失关于动力学和行为的信息。这是由于扫描路径很难建模，因为它必须包含动态描述。除了问题本身的困难之外，还有两个技术原因限制了研究。第一个原因是缺乏稳健和统一使用的一组指标来比较scanpath之间的相似性。第二个原因是缺少足够大和多样化的扫描路径数据集。在这个报告中，我们想要帮助两个方向。我们介绍FixaTons，人类scanpaths（和显着性地图）的大集合。它附带了一个软件库，用于简化数据使用，统计计算和扫描路径（和显着图）的相似性度量。
