##### Abstract
Convolutional neural networks are ubiquitous in Machine Learning applications for solving a variety of problems. They however can not be used in their native form when the domain of the data is commonly encountered manifolds such as the sphere, the special orthogonal group, the Grassmanian, the manifold of symmetric positive definite matrices and others. Most recently, generalization of CNNs to data domains such as the 2-sphere has been reported by some research groups, which is referred to as the spherical CNNs (SCNNs). The key property of SCNNs distinct from CNNs is that they exhibit the rotational equivariance property that allows for sharing learned weights within a layer. In this paper, we theoretically generalize the CNNs to Riemannian homogeneous manifolds, that include but are not limited to the aforementioned example manifolds. Our key contributions in this work are: (i) A theorem stating that linear group equivariance systems are fully characterized by correlation of functions on the domain manifold and vice-versa. This is fundamental to the characterization of all linear group equivariant systems and parallels the widely used result in linear system theory for vector spaces. (ii) As a corrolary, we prove the equivariance of the correlation operation to group actions admitted by the input domains which are Riemannian homogeneous manifolds. (iii) We present the first end-to-end deep network architecture for classification of diffusion magnetic resonance image (dMRI) scans acquired from a cohort of 44 Parkinson Disease patients and 50 control/normal subjects. (iv) A proof of concept experiment involving synthetic data generated on the manifold of symmetric positive definite matrices is presented to demonstrate the applicability of our network to other types of domains.

卷积神经网络在机器学习应用程序中无处不在，用于解决各种问题。然而，当数据域通常遇到诸如球体，特殊正交群，Grassmanian，对称正定矩阵的流形等歧管时，它们不能以其原生形式使用。最近，一些研究小组报告了CNN向诸如2球等数据域的推广，其被称为球形CNN（SCNN）。与CNN不同的SCNN的关键属性是它们表现出旋转等效性，允许在层内共享学习的权重。在本文中，我们理论上将CNN推广到黎曼均匀流形，包括但不限于上述示例流形。我们在这项工作中的关键贡献是：（i）一个定理，表明线性群等价系统的完全特征是域流形上的函数的相关性，反之亦然。这对于所有线性群等变系统的表征是基础，并且与向量空间的线性系统理论中广泛使用的结果相似。 （ii）作为证据，我们证明了相关运算与由黎曼均匀流形的输入域所承认的群体行为的等价性。 （iii）我们提出了第一个端到端深度网络架构，用于分类从44名帕金森病患者和50名对照/正常受试者中获得的扩散磁共振图像（dMRI）扫描。 （iv）提出概念验证实验，该实验涉及在对称正定矩阵的流形上生成的合成数据，以证明我们的网络对其他类型域的适用性。
