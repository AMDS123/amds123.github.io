##### Abstract
The segmentation of synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images is a longstanding yet challenging task, not only because of the presence of speckle, but also due to the variations of surface backscattering properties in the images. Tremendous investigations have been made to eliminate the speckle effects for the segmentation of SAR images, while few work devotes to dealing with the variations of backscattering coefficients in the images. In order to overcome both the two difficulties, this paper presents a novel SAR image segmentation method by exploiting a multi-scale active contour model based on the non-local processing principle. More precisely, we first formulize the SAR segmentation problem with an active contour model by integrating the non-local interactions between pairs of patches inside and outside the segmented regions. Secondly, a multi-scale strategy is proposed to speed up the non-local active contour segmentation procedure and to avoid falling into local minimum for achieving more accurate segmentation results. Experimental results on simulated and real SAR images demonstrate the efficiency and feasibility of the proposed method: it can not only achieve precise segmentations for images with heavy speckles and non-local intensity variations, but also can be used for SAR images from different types of sensors.

##### Abstract (translated by Google)
合成孔径雷达（SAR）图像的分割是一项长期而富有挑战性的任务，不仅因为存在斑点，而且由于图像中表面反向散射性质的变化。为了消除SAR图像分割的斑点效应，已经做了大量的研究工作，但很少有工作致力于处理图像中后向散射系数的变化。为了克服这两个困难，本文提出了一种基于非局部处理原理的多尺度主动轮廓模型的SAR图像分割方法。更确切地说，我们首先通过整合分割区域内外的补丁对之间的非局部相互作用来形成活动轮廓模型的SAR分割问题。其次，提出了一种多尺度策略，加快了非局部主动轮廓分割过程，避免陷入局部极小值，实现更精确的分割结果。仿真和实际SAR图像的实验结果表明了该方法的有效性和可行性：该方法不仅可以对重斑点和非局部强度变化的图像进行精确分割，而且可以用于不同类型传感器的SAR图像。
