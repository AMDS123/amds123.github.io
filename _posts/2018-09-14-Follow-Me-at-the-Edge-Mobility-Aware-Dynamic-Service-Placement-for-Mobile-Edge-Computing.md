##### Abstract
Mobile edge computing is a new computing paradigm, which pushes cloud computing capabilities away from the centralized cloud to the network edge. However, with the sinking of computing capabilities, the new challenge incurred by user mobility arises: since end-users typically move erratically, the services should be dynamically migrated among multiple edges to maintain the service performance, i.e., user-perceived latency. Tackling this problem is non-trivial since frequent service migration would greatly increase the operational cost. To address this challenge in terms of the performance-cost trade-off, in this paper we study the mobile edge service performance optimization problem under long-term cost budget constraint. To address user mobility which is typically unpredictable, we apply Lyapunov optimization to decompose the long-term optimization problem into a series of real-time optimization problems which do not require a priori knowledge such as user mobility. As the decomposed problem is NP-hard, we first design an approximation algorithm based on Markov approximation to seek a near-optimal solution. To make our solution scalable and amenable to future 5G application scenario with large-scale user devices, we further propose a distributed approximation scheme with greatly reduced time complexity, based on the technique of best response update. Rigorous theoretical analysis and extensive evaluations demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed centralized and distributed schemes.

移动边缘计算是一种新的计算范例，它将云计算功能从集中式云推向网络边缘。然而，随着计算能力的下沉，用户移动性引起的新挑战出现：由于最终用户通常不规律地移动，所以应该在多个边缘之间动态地迁移服务以维持服务性能，即用户感知的等待时间。解决这个问题并非易事，因为频繁的服务迁移会大大增加运营成本。为了在性能 - 成本权衡方面解决这一挑战，本文研究了长期成本预算约束下的移动边缘服务性能优化问题。为了解决通常不可预测的用户移动性，我们应用Lyapunov优化将长期优化问题分解为一系列实时优化问题，这些问题不需要诸如用户移动性之类的先验知识。由于分解问题是NP难的，我们首先设计一种基于马尔可夫近似的近似算法来寻求近似最优解。为了使我们的解决方案可扩展并适用于具有大规模用户设备的未来5G应用场景，我们进一步提出了基于最佳响应更新技术的分布式近似方案，其大大降低了时间复杂度。严格的理论分析和广泛的评估证明了所提出的集中式和分布式方案的有效性。
