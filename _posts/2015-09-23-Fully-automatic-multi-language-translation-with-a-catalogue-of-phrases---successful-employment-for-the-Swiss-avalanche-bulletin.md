##### Abstract
The Swiss avalanche bulletin is produced twice a day in four languages. Due to the lack of time available for manual translation, a fully automated translation system is employed, based on a catalogue of predefined phrases and predetermined rules of how these phrases can be combined to produce sentences. Because this catalogue of phrases is limited to a small sublanguage, the system is able to automatically translate such sentences from German into the target languages French, Italian and English without subsequent proofreading or correction. Having been operational for two winter seasons, we assess here the quality of the produced texts based on two different surveys where participants rated texts from real avalanche bulletins from both origins, the catalogue of phrases versus manually written and translated texts. With a mean recognition rate of 55%, users can hardly distinguish between thetwo types of texts, and give very similar ratings with respect to their language quality. Overall, the output from the catalogue system can be considered virtually equivalent to a text written by avalanche forecasters and then manually translated by professional translators. Furthermore, forecasters declared that all relevant situations were captured by the system with sufficient accuracy. Forecaster's working load did not change with the introduction of the catalogue: the extra time to find matching sentences is compensated by the fact that they no longer need to double-check manually translated texts. The reduction of daily translation costs is expected to offset the initial development costs within a few years.

瑞士雪崩公报每天两次以四种语言制作。由于缺乏可用于手动翻译的时间，基于预定义短语的目录和这些短语如何组合以产生句子的预定规则，采用全自动翻译系统。由于该短语仅限于一个小的子语言，因此系统能够自动将这些句子从德语翻译成法语，意大利语和英语的目标语言，而无需随后进行校对或更正。在两个冬季的运行中，我们在这里评估生成的文本的质量基于两个不同的调查，参与者评价来自两个来源的真实雪崩公告，短语目录与手动编写和翻译文本的文本。平均识别率为55％，用户很难区分这两种类型的文本，并且在语言质量方面给予非常相似的评价。总的来说，目录系统的输出可以认为实际上等同于由雪崩预报员编写的文本，然后由专业翻译人员手动翻译。此外，预报员宣布，所有相关情况都被系统捕获，并具有足够的准确性。预报员的工作负荷并没有随着目录的介绍而改变：寻找匹配句子的额外时间得到了补偿，因为他们不再需要仔细检查手动翻译的文本。日常翻译成本的降低预计将在几年内抵消最初的开发成本。
