##### Abstract
In recent years, voice knowledge sharing and question answering (Q&amp;A) platforms have attracted much attention, which greatly facilitate the knowledge acquisition for people. However, little research has evaluated on the quality evaluation on voice knowledge sharing. This paper presents a data-driven approach to automatically evaluate the quality of a specific Q&amp;A platform (Zhihu Live). Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. Furthermore, we introduce a dataset of Zhihu Live as an open resource for researchers in related areas. This dataset will facilitate the development of new methods on knowledge sharing services quality evaluation.
