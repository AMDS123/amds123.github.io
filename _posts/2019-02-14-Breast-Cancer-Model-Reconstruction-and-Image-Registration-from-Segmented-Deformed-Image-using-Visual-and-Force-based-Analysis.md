##### Abstract
Breast lesion localization using tactile imaging is a new and developing direction in medical science. To achieve the goal, proper image reconstruction and image registration can be a valuable asset. In this paper, a new approach of the segmentation-based image surface reconstruction algorithm is used to reconstruct the surface of a breast phantom. In breast tissue, the sub-dermal vein network is used as a distinguishable pattern for reconstruction. The proposed image capturing device contacts the surface of the phantom, and surface deformation will occur due to applied force at the time of scanning. A novel force based surface rectification system is used to reconstruct a deformed surface image to its original structure. For the construction of the full surface from rectified images, advanced affine scale-invariant feature transform (A-SIFT) is proposed to reduce the affine effect in time when data capturing. Camera position based image stitching approach is applied to construct the final original non-rigid surface. The proposed model is validated in theoretical models and real scenarios, to demonstrate its advantages with respect to competing methods. The result of the proposed method, applied to path reconstruction, ends with a positioning accuracy of 99.7%
