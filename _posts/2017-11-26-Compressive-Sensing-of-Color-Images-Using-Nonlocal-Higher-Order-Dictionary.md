##### Abstract
This paper addresses an ill-posed problem of recovering a color image from its compressively sensed measurement data. Differently from the typical 1D vector-based approach of the state-of-the-art methods, we exploit the nonlocal similarities inherently existing in images by treating each patch of a color image as a 3D tensor consisting of not only horizontal and vertical but also spectral dimensions. A group of nonlocal similar patches form a 4D tensor for which a nonlocal higher order dictionary is learned via higher order singular value decomposition. The multiple sub-dictionaries contained in the higher order dictionary decorrelate the group in each corresponding dimension, thus help the detail of color images to be reconstructed better. Furthermore, we promote sparsity of the final solution using a sparsity regularization based on a weight tensor. It can distinguish those coefficients of the sparse representation generated by the higher order dictionary which are expected to have large magnitude from the others in the optimization. Accordingly, in the iterative solution, it acts like a weighting process which is designed by approximating the minimum mean squared error filter for more faithful recovery. Experimental results confirm improvement by the proposed method over the state-of-the-art ones.

本文讨论了从其压缩感测的测量数据恢复彩色图像的不适当问题。与现有技术中典型的基于一维向量的方法不同，我们利用图像中固有的非局部相似性，将彩色图像的每个小块作为不仅包括水平和垂直的3D张量，而且还包括光谱尺寸。一组非局部类似的斑块形成一个4D张量，通过高阶奇异值分解学习非局部高阶字典。高阶词典中包含的多个子词典使得每个对应维度的分组不相关，从而有助于更好地重构彩色图像的细节。此外，我们使用基于权重张量的稀疏正则化来促进最终解决方案的稀疏性。在优化过程中，可以将高阶词典所产生的稀疏表示的系数区分开来，这些高阶词典的期望值较大。因此，在迭代解决方案中，它像加权过程一样，通过逼近最小均方误差滤波器来进行更加忠实的恢复。实验结果证实了所提出的方法相对于现有技术的改进。
