##### Abstract
The paper focuses on the problem of vision-based obstacle detection and tracking for unmanned aerial vehicle navigation. A real-time object localization and tracking strategy from monocular image sequences is developed by effectively integrating the object detection and tracking into a dynamic Kalman model. At the detection stage, the object of interest is automatically detected and localized from a saliency map computed via the image background connectivity cue at each frame; at the tracking stage, a Kalman filter is employed to provide a coarse prediction of the object state, which is further refined via a local detector incorporating the saliency map and the temporal information between two consecutive frames. Compared to existing methods, the proposed approach does not require any manual initialization for tracking, runs much faster than the state-of-the-art trackers of its kind, and achieves competitive tracking performance on a large number of image sequences. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and superior performance of the proposed approach.

本文重点研究无人机导航视觉障碍检测与跟踪问题。通过将物体检测和跟踪有效地结合到动态卡尔曼模型中，开发了单眼图像序列的实时对象定位和跟踪策略。在检测阶段，感兴趣的对象被自动检测并且从在每一帧通过图像背景连通性提示计算的显着图中定位;在跟踪阶段，采用卡尔曼滤波器来提供物体状态的粗略预测，该粗略预测通过合并显着图和两个连续帧之间的时间信息的局部检测器进一步改进。与现有方法相比，所提出的方法不需要任何手动初始化来跟踪，比现有技术的跟踪器运行速度快得多，并且在大量图像序列上实现了有竞争力的跟踪性能。大量的实验证明了所提出方法的有效性和优越性能。
