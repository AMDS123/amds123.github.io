##### Abstract
Multicopters are becoming increasingly important in both civil and military fields. Currently, most multicopter propulsion systems are designed by experience and trial-and-error experiments, which are costly and ineffective. This paper proposes a simple and practical method to help designers find the optimal propulsion system according to the given design requirements. First, the modeling methods for four basic components of the propulsion system including propellers, motors, electric speed controls, and batteries are studied respectively. Secondly, the whole optimization design problem is simplified and decoupled into several sub-problems. By solving these sub-problems, the optimal parameters of each component can be obtained respectively. Finally, based on the obtained optimal component parameters, the optimal product of each component can be quickly located and determined from the corresponding database. Experiments and statistical analyses demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

Multicopters在民用和军用领域变得越来越重要。目前，大多数多旋翼飞行器推进系统是通过经验和反复试验设计的，这些实验成本高且效率低。本文提出了一种简单实用的方法，帮助设计人员根据给定的设计要求找到最优的推进系统。首先，分别研究了推进系统的四个基本部件的建模方法，包括螺旋桨，电动机，电动速度控制和电池。其次，整个优化设计问题被简化并解耦为几个子问题。通过解决这些子问题，可以分别获得每个组件的最佳参数。最后，基于所获得的最佳组件参数，可以从相应的数据库快速定位和确定每个组件的最佳产品。实验和统计分析证明了所提方法的有效性。
