##### Abstract
A novel algorithm for wide-baseline matching called MODS - Matching On Demand with view Synthesis - is presented. The MODS algorithm is experimentally shown to solve a broader range of wide-baseline problems than the state of the art while being nearly as fast as standard matchers on simple problems. The apparent robustness vs. speed trade-off is finessed by the use of progressively more time-consuming feature detectors and by on-demand generation of synthesized images that is performed until a reliable estimate of geometry is obtained. We introduce an improved method for tentative correspondence selection, applicable both with and without view synthesis. A modification of the standard first to second nearest distance rule increases the number of correct matches by 5-20% at no additional computational cost. Performance of the MODS algorithm is evaluated on several standard publicly available datasets, and on a new set of geometrically challenging wide baseline problems that is made public together with the ground truth. Experiments show that the MODS outperforms the state-of-the-art in robustness and speed. Moreover, MODS performs well on other classes of difficult two-view problems like matching of images from different modalities, with wide temporal baseline or with significant lighting changes.

提出了一种新的宽基线匹配算法 -  MODS  - 视点匹配与视点合成 - 。实验证明，MODS算法能够解决比现有技术更广泛的宽基线问题，而在简单问题上几乎与标准匹配者一样快。通过使用渐进式更耗时的特征检测器以及通过按需生成合成图像来执行明显的鲁棒性与速度之间的权衡，直到获得可靠的几何估计。我们介绍了一个改进的方法，用于暂时的对应选择，适用于有和没有视图合成。标准的第一到第二最近距离规则的修改将正确匹配的数量增加5-20％，而无需额外的计算成本。 MODS算法的性能在几个标准的公开可用的数据集上进行评估，并在一组新的具有几何挑战性的宽基线问题上与基础事实一起公开。实验表明，MODS在鲁棒性和速度方面优于现有技术。此外，MODS在其他类别的困难的双视图问题上表现良好，如来自不同模式的图像的匹配，具有宽的时间基线或明显的照明变化。
