##### Abstract
The field of open-domain conversation generation using deep neural networks has attracted increasing attention from researchers for several years. However, traditional neural language models tend to generate safe, generic reply with poor logic and no emotion. In this paper, an emotional conversation generation orientated syntactically constrained bidirectional-asynchronous framework called E-SCBA is proposed to generate meaningful (logical and emotional) reply.As an innovative idea, in E-SCBA, pre-generated emotion keyword and topic keyword are asynchronously introduced into the reply during the the process of generation, and the process of decoding is much different from the most existing methods generating reply from the first word to the end. A newly designed bidirectional-asynchronous decoder with the multi-stage strategy is proposed to support this idea, which ensures the fluency and grammaticality of reply by making full use of syntactic constraints. Through the experiments, the results show that our framework not only improves the diversity of replies, but gains a boost on both logic and emotion compared with baselines as well.

多年来，使用深度神经网络的开放域对话生成领域越来越受到研究人员的关注。然而，传统的神经语言模型倾向于生成安全的，通用的回应，其逻辑性差，没有情感。在本文中，提出了一种情感会话生成定向语法约束的双向异步框架E-SCBA，用于生成有意义的（逻辑和情感）回复。作为一种创新思想，在E-SCBA中，预生成情绪关键字和主题关键字是异步地引入到生成过程中的回复中，并且解码过程与从第一个字到最后生成回复的大多数现有方法大不相同。提出了一种新型的多级策略双向异步解码器来支持该思想，充分利用语法约束，保证了答案的流畅性和语法性。通过实验，结果显示我们的框架不仅提高了回复的多样性，而且与基线相比，逻辑和情绪都有所提高。
