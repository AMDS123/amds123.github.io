##### Abstract
Driver inattention is a large problem on the roads around the world. The objective of this project was to develop an eye tracking algorithm with sufficient computational efficiency and accuracy, to successfully realize when the driver was looking away from the road for an extended period. The method of tracking involved the minimization of a functional, using the gradient descent and level set methods. The algorithm was then discretized and implemented using C and MATLAB. Multiple synthetic images, grey-scale and colour images were tested using the final design, with a desired region coverage of 82%. Further work is needed to decrease the computation time, increase the robustness of the algorithm, develop a small device capable of running the algorithm, as well as physically implement this device into various vehicles.
