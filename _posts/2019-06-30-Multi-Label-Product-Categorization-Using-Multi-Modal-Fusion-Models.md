##### Abstract
In this study, we investigated multi-modal approaches using images, descriptions, and title to categorize e-commerce products on Amazon.com. Specifically, we examined late fusion models, where the modalities are fused at the decision level. Products were each assigned multiple labels, and the hierarchy in the labels were flattened and filtered. For our individual baseline models, we modified a CNN architecture to classify the description and title, and then modified Keras' ResNet-50 to classify the images, achieving F1 scores of 77.0%, 82.7%, and 61.0%, respectively. In comparison, our tri-modal late fusion model can classify products more accurately than single modal models can, improving the F1 score to 88.2%. Each modality complemented the shortcomings of the other modalities, demonstrating that increasing the number of modalities can be an effective method for improving the accuracy of multi-label classification problems.
