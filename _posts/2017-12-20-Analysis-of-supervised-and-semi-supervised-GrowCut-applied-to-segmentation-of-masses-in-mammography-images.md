##### Abstract
Breast cancer is already one of the most common form of cancer worldwide. Mammography image analysis is still the most effective diagnostic method to promote the early detection of breast cancer. Accurately segmenting tumors in digital mammography images is important to improve diagnosis capabilities of health specialists and avoid misdiagnosis. In this work, we evaluate the feasibility of applying GrowCut to segment regions of tumor and we propose two GrowCut semi-supervised versions. All the analysis was performed by evaluating the application of segmentation techniques to a set of images obtained from the Mini-MIAS mammography image database. GrowCut segmentation was compared to Region Growing, Active Contours, Random Walks and Graph Cut techniques. Experiments showed that GrowCut, when compared to the other techniques, was able to acquire better results for the metrics analyzed. Moreover, the proposed semi-supervised versions of GrowCut was proved to have a clinically satisfactory quality of segmentation.

乳腺癌已经是全球最常见的癌症之一。乳腺造影图像分析仍然是促进乳腺癌早期发现的最有效的诊断方法。在数字化乳房X线照相术图像中精确分割肿瘤，对于提高健康专家的诊断能力和避免误诊非常重要。在这项工作中，我们评估应用GrowCut分割肿瘤区域的可行性，我们提出了两个GrowCut半监督版本。所有的分析都是通过评估将分割技术应用于从Mini-MIAS乳房X线照相术图像数据库获得的一组图像来进行的。将GrowCut分割与区域增长，活动轮廓，随机游走和图形切割技术进行比较。实验表明，与其他技术相比，GrowCut能够获得更好的分析结果。此外，所提出的半监督版本的GrowCut被证明具有临床满意的分割质量。
