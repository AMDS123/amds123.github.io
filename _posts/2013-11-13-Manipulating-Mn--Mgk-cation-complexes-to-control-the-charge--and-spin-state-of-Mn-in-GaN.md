##### Abstract
Owing to the variety of possible charge and spin states and to the different ways of coupling to the environment, paramagnetic centres in wide band-gap semiconductors and insulators exhibit a strikingly rich spectrum of properties and functionalities, exploited in commercial light emitters and proposed for applications in quantum information. Here we demonstrate, by combining synchrotron techniques with magnetic, optical and \emph{ab initio} studies, that the codoping of GaN:Mn with Mg allows to control the Mn$^{n+}$ charge and spin state in the range $3\le n\le 5$ and $2\ge S\ge 1$. According to our results, this outstanding degree of tunability arises from the formation of hitherto concealed cation complexes Mn-Mg$_k$, where the number of ligands $k$ is pre-defined by fabrication conditions. The properties of these complexes allow to extend towards the infrared the already remarkable optical capabilities of nitrides, open to solotronics functionalities, and generally represent a fresh perspective for magnetic semiconductors.
