##### Abstract
Question generation aims to generate natural language questions from a range of data sources such as free text and image. In this paper, we investigate the difficulty levels of questions, and propose a new task called Difficulty Controllable Question Generation (Dico-QG). Taking as input a reading comprehension paragraph and some text fragments (i.e. answers) in the paragraph that we want to ask about, a Dico-QG method needs to generate questions each of which has a given text fragment as its answer and is associated with a difficulty label. To solve this task, we proposed a two-step approach. The first step estimates what difficulty level of question could be generated for a given answer. After that, in the generation step, the estimated difficulty is employed together with other information as input to generate a question. For evaluation, we prepared the first dataset of reading comprehension questions with difficulty labels. The results show that our approach not only generates questions of better quality under the metrics like BLEU, but also has the capability of difficulty awareness to generate questions complying with the difficulty label.

问题生成旨在从一系列数据源（如自由文本和图像）生成自然语言问题。在本文中，我们调查问题的难度级别，并提出一个称为难度可控问题生成（Dico-QG）的新任务。将我们想要询问的段落中的阅读理解段落和一些文本片段（即答案）作为输入，Dico-QG方法需要生成问题，每个问题都有给定的文本片段作为答案并且与困难标签。为了解决这个任务，我们提出了一个两步法。第一步估计可以为给定答案生成问题的难度级别。之后，在生成步骤中，将估计的难度与其他信息一起用作输入以生成问题。为了评估，我们准备了第一个具有难度标签的阅读理解问题数据集。结果表明，我们的方法不仅可以在BLEU等指标下生成质量更高的问题，而且还具有难以识别的能力，可以生成符合难度标签的问题。
