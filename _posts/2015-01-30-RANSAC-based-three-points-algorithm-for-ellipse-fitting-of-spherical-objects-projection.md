##### Abstract
As the spherical object can be seen everywhere, we should extract the ellipse image accurately and fit it by implicit algebraic curve in order to finish the 3D reconstruction. In this paper, we propose a new ellipse fitting algorithm which only needs three points to fit the projection of spherical object and is different from the traditional algorithms that need at least five point. The fitting procedure is just similar as the estimation of Fundamental Matrix estimation by seven points, and the RANSAC algorithm has also been used to exclude the interference of noise and scattered points.

由于球面物体随处可见，因此我们应该精确地提取椭圆图像并用隐代数曲线拟合，以完成三维重建。在本文中，我们提出了一种新的椭圆拟合算法，它只需要三个点来拟合球形物体的投影，而不同于传统的算法至少需要五点。拟合过程与基本矩阵估计的估计方法相似，七点，RANSAC算法也被用来排除噪声和散射点的干扰。
