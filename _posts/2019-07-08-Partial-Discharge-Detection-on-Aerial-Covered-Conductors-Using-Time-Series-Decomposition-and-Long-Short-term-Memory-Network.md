##### Abstract
Nowadays, aerial covered conductors (CC) are increasingly used in many places of the world due to their higher operational reliability, reduced construction space and effective protection for wildlife animals. In spite of these advantages, a major challenge of using CC is that the ordinary upstream protection devices are not able to detect the phase-to-ground faults and the frequent tree/tree branch hitting conductor events on such conductors. This is because these events only lead to partial discharge (PD) activities rather than overcurrent signatures typically seen on bare conductors. To solve this problem, in recent years, ENET Center in Czech Republic (ENET) devised a simple meter to measure the voltage signal of the electric stray field along CC, aiming to detect the above hazardous PD activities. In 2018, ENET shared a large amount of waveform data recorded by their meter on Kaggle, the world's largest data science collaboration platform, encouraging worldwide experts to develop an effective pattern recognition method for the acquired signals. In response, we developed a unique method based on time-series decomposition and Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM) in addition to unique feature engineering process to recognize PD activities on CC. The proposed method is tested on the ENET public dataset and compared to various traditional classification methods. It demonstrated superior performance and great practicality.
