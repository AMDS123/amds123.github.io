##### Abstract
The minimum energy paths for the migration of interstitial Mg in wurtzite GaN are studied through density functional calculations. The study also comprises Li, Na, and Be dopants to examine the dependence on size and charge of the dopant species. In all cases considered, the impurities diffuse like ions without any tendency of localizing charge. Li, Mg, and to some extent Na, diffuse almost isotropically in GaN, with average diffusion barriers of 1.1, 2.1, and 2.5 eV, respectively. Instead Be shows a marked anisotropy with energy barriers of 0.76 and 1.88 eV for diffusion paths perpendicular and parallel to the c-axis. The diffusion barrier generally increases with ionic charge and ionic radius, but their interplay is not trivial. The calculated migration barrier for Mg is consistent with the values estimated in a recent beta- emission channeling experiment.
