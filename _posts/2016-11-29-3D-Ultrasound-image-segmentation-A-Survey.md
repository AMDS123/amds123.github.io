##### Abstract
Three-dimensional Ultrasound image segmentation methods are surveyed in this paper. The focus of this report is to investigate applications of these techniques and a review of the original ideas and concepts. Although many two-dimensional image segmentation in the literature have been considered as a three-dimensional approach by mistake but we review them as a three-dimensional technique. We select the studies that have addressed the problem of medical three-dimensional Ultrasound image segmentation utilizing their proposed techniques. The evaluation methods and comparison between them are presented and tabulated in terms of evaluation techniques, interactivity, and robustness.
