##### Abstract
Accurate, robust, inexpensive gaze tracking in the car can help keep a driver safe by facilitating the more effective study of how to improve (1) vehicle interfaces and (2) the design of future Advanced Driver Assistance Systems. In this paper, we estimate head pose and eye pose from monocular video using methods developed extensively in prior work and ask two new interesting questions. First, how much better can we classify driver gaze using head and eye pose versus just using head pose? Second, are there individual-specific gaze strategies that strongly correlate with how much gaze classification improves with the addition of eye pose information? We answer these questions by evaluating data drawn from an on-road study of 40 drivers. The main insight of the paper is conveyed through the analogy of an "owl" and "lizard" which describes the degree to which the eyes and the head move when shifting gaze. When the head moves a lot ("owl"), not much classification improvement is attained by estimating eye pose on top of head pose. On the other hand, when the head stays still and only the eyes move ("lizard"), classification accuracy increases significantly from adding in eye pose. We characterize how that accuracy varies between people, gaze strategies, and gaze regions.

（1）车辆接口和（2）未来高级驾驶员辅助系统的设计，可以帮助保持司机的安全。在本文中，我们使用先前工作中广泛开发的方法来估计单眼视频的头部姿态和眼部姿态，并提出两个新的有趣问题。首先，我们可以用头部和眼部姿势来分类驾驶者的视线，而不仅仅是使用头部姿势？其次，是否有个人特定的注视策略与多少注视分类与增加的眼姿信息有很大关联？我们通过评估40位司机的道路研究数据来回答这些问题。本文的主要观点是通过“猫头鹰”和“蜥蜴”的比喻来表达的，它描述了在转移注视时眼睛和头部移动的程度。当头部移动很多（“猫头鹰”）时，通过估计头部姿势之上的眼睛姿态而没有获得太多的分类改进。另一方面，当头部保持静止并且只有眼睛移动时（“蜥蜴”），分类准确性从增加眼睛姿态显着增加。我们描述了人们，注视策略和凝视区域之间的准确度如何变化。
