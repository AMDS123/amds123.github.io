##### Abstract
Musical features and descriptors could be coarsely divided into three levels of complexity. The bottom level contains the basic building blocks of music, e.g., chords, beats and timbre. The middle level contains concepts that emerge from combining the basic blocks: tonal and rhythmic stability, harmonic and rhythmic complexity, etc. High-level descriptors (genre, mood, expressive style) are usually modeled using the lower level ones. The features belonging to the middle level can both improve automatic recognition of high-level descriptors, and provide new music retrieval possibilities. Mid-level features are subjective and usually lack clear definitions. However, they are very important for human perception of music, and on some of them people can reach high agreement, even though defining them and therefore, designing a hand-crafted feature extractor for them can be difficult. In this paper, we derive the mid-level descriptors from data. We collect and release a dataset\footnote{this https URL} of 5000 songs annotated by musicians with seven mid-level descriptors, namely, melodiousness, tonal and rhythmic stability, modality, rhythmic complexity, dissonance and articulation. We then compare several approaches to predicting these descriptors from spectrograms using deep-learning. We also demonstrate the usefulness of these mid-level features using music emotion recognition as an application.

音乐特征和描述符可以粗略地分为三个复杂等级。底层包含音乐的基本构建块，例如和弦，节拍和音色。中等水平包含了将基本块结合起来的概念：音调和节奏稳定性，和声和节奏复杂性等。高级描述符（流派，情绪，表现风格）通常使用较低级别描述符来建模。属于中等水平的特征既可以改进高级描述符的自动识别，又可以提供新的音乐检索可能性。中等特征是主观的，通常缺乏明确的定义。然而，它们对于人类对音乐的感知是非常重要的，并且其中一些人可以达成高度一致，即使对它们进行了定义，因此为它们设计手工特征提取器可能是困难的。在本文中，我们从数据中推导出中级描述符。我们收集并发布了由音乐家注释的5000首歌曲的数据集\脚注{这个https URL}，其中包含七个中级描述符，即悠扬，音调和节奏稳定性，形态，节奏复杂性，不和谐和清晰度。然后我们比较几种使用深度学习从谱图预测这些描述符的方法。我们还演示了这些使用音乐情感识别作为应用程序的中级功能的实用性。
