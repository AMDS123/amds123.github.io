##### Abstract
Sequential pattern mining techniques extract patterns corresponding to frequent subsequences from a sequence database. A practical limitation of these techniques is that they overload the user with too many patterns. Local Process Model (LPM) mining is an alternative approach coming from the field of process mining. While in traditional sequential pattern mining, a pattern describes one subsequence, an LPM captures a set of subsequences. Also, while traditional sequential patterns only match subsequences that are observed in the sequence database, an LPM may capture subsequences that are not explicitly observed, but that are related to observed subsequences. In other words, LPMs generalize the behavior observed in the sequence database. These properties make it possible for a set of LPMs to cover the behavior of a much larger set of sequential patterns. Yet, existing LPM mining techniques still suffer from the pattern explosion problem because they produce sets of redundant LPMs. In this paper, we propose several heuristics to mine a set of non-redundant LPMs either from a set of redundant LPMs or from a set of sequential patterns. We empirically compare the proposed heuristics between them and against existing (local) process mining techniques in terms of coverage, precision, and complexity of the produced sets of LPMs.

顺序模式挖掘技术从序列数据库中提取对应于频繁子序列的模式。这些技术的一个实际限制是它们使用户的模式过多。本地过程模型（LPM）挖掘是来自过程挖掘领域的替代方法。而在传统的序列模式挖掘中，模式描述了一个子序列，LPM捕获了一系列的子序列。另外，尽管传统的序列模式只匹配在序列数据库中观察到的子序列，但是LPM可以捕获未被明确观察到但是与观察到的子序列相关的子序列。换句话说，LPM概括了序列数据库中观察到的行为。这些属性使得一组LPM可以覆盖更大的一组序列模式的行为。然而，现有的LPM开采技术仍然受到模式爆炸问题的困扰，因为它们产生多组多余的LPM。在本文中，我们提出了几种启发式方法，从一组冗余LPM或一组序列模式中挖掘一组非冗余LPM。我们通过实证比较他们之间的建议启发式和现有的（本地）过程挖掘技术在所生成的LPM集合的覆盖率，精确度和复杂度方面。
