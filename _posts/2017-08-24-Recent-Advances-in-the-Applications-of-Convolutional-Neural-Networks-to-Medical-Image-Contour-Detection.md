##### Abstract
The fast growing deep learning technologies have become the main solution of many machine learning problems for medical image analysis. Deep convolution neural networks (CNNs), as one of the most important branch of the deep learning family, have been widely investigated for various computer-aided diagnosis tasks including long-term problems and continuously emerging new problems. Image contour detection is a fundamental but challenging task that has been studied for more than four decades. Recently, we have witnessed the significantly improved performance of contour detection thanks to the development of CNNs. Beyond purusing performance in existing natural image benchmarks, contour detection plays a particularly important role in medical image analysis. Segmenting various objects from radiology images or pathology images requires accurate detection of contours. However, some problems, such as discontinuity and shape constraints, are insufficiently studied in CNNs. It is necessary to clarify the challenges to encourage further exploration. The performance of CNN based contour detection relies on the state-of-the-art CNN architectures. Careful investigation of their design principles and motivations is critical and beneficial to contour detection. In this paper, we first review recent development of medical image contour detection and point out the current confronting challenges and problems. We discuss the development of general CNNs and their applications in image contours (or edges) detection. We compare those methods in detail, clarify their strengthens and weaknesses. Then we review their recent applications in medical image analysis and point out limitations, with the goal to light some potential directions in medical image analysis. We expect the paper to cover comprehensive technical ingredients of advanced CNNs to enrich the study in the medical image domain.

快速发展的深度学习技术已成为医学图像分析中许多机器学习问题的主要解决方案。作为深度学习家族中最重要的分支之一，深度卷积神经网络（CNNs）被广泛研究用于包括长期问题和不断出现的新问题在内的各种计算机辅助诊断任务。图像轮廓检测是一项基本但是具有挑战性的任务，已经有四十多年的历史。最近，由于CNN的发展，我们目睹了轮廓检测性能的显着提高。除了在现有的自然图像基准上的性能，轮廓检测在医学图像分析中起着特别重要的作用。从放射图像或病理图像分割各种对象需要准确检测轮廓。然而，有些问题，如不连续性和形状约束，在CNNs中研究不足。有必要澄清鼓励进一步探索的挑战。基于CNN的轮廓检测的性能依赖于最先进的CNN体​​系结构。仔细研究其设计原则和动机对轮廓检测至关重要并且有益。本文首先回顾了近年来医学图像轮廓检测的发展，指出了当前面临的挑战和问题。我们讨论一般CNN的发展及其在图像轮廓（或边缘）检测中的应用。我们详细比较这些方法，澄清它们的强化和弱点。然后，我们回顾他们最近在医学图像分析中的应用，并指出了局限性，目标是在医学图像分析中指出一些潜在的方向。我们期望本文能够涵盖先进的CNNs的综合技术成分，以丰富医学影像领域的研究。
