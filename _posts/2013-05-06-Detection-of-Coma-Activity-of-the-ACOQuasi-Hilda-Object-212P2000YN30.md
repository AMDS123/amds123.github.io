##### Abstract
The quasi-Hilda object, 212P/2000YN30 with a cometary-like orbit, was found to display a dust tail structure between January and March, 2009. From orbital calculations, it is shown that this object could have been an active comet in its past history before being transported to the current orbital configuration in quasi-stable 3:2 resonance with Jupiter.
