##### Abstract
Eliminating the negative effect of non-stationary environmental noise is a long-standing research topic for automatic speech recognition but still remains an important challenge. Data-driven supervised approaches, especially the ones based on deep neural networks, have recently emerged as potential alternatives to traditional unsupervised approaches and with sufficient training, can alleviate the shortcomings of the unsupervised methods in various real-life acoustic environments. In this light, we review recently developed, representative deep learning approaches for tackling non-stationary additive and convolutional degradation of speech with the aim of providing guidelines for those involved in the development of environmentally robust speech recognition systems. We separately discuss single- and multi-channel techniques developed for the front-end and back-end of speech recognition systems, as well as joint front-end and back-end training frameworks.

消除非静态环境噪声的负面影响是自动语音识别的一个长期研究课题，但仍然是一个重要的挑战。数据驱动的监督式方法，特别是基于深度神经网络的方法最近已经成为传统无监督方法的潜在替代方案，并且具有充分的训练，可以减轻各种真实声学环境中无监督方法的缺点。鉴于此，我们回顾了最近开发的具有代表性的深度学习方法，用于解决语音的非平稳添加和卷积降级问题，旨在为参与开发环境稳健语音识别系统的人员提供指导。我们分别讨论了为语音识别系统的前端和后端开发的单信道和多信道技术，以及联合的前端和后端训练框架。
