##### Abstract
The problem of word sense disambiguation (WSD) is considered in the article. Given a set of synonyms (synsets) and sentences with these synonyms. It is necessary to select the meaning of the word in the sentence automatically. 1285 sentences were tagged by experts, namely, one of the dictionary meanings was selected by experts for target words. To solve the WSD-problem, an algorithm based on a new method of vector-word contexts proximity calculation is proposed. In order to achieve higher accuracy, a preliminary epsilon-filtering of words is performed, both in the sentence and in the set of synonyms. An extensive program of experiments was carried out. Four algorithms are implemented, including a new algorithm. Experiments have shown that in a number of cases the new algorithm shows better results. The developed software and the tagged corpus have an open license and are available online. Wiktionary and Wikisource are used. A brief description of this work can be viewed in slides (https://goo.gl/9ak6Gt). Video lecture in Russian on this research is available online (https://youtu.be/-DLmRkepf58).

文章中考虑了词义消歧（WSD）的问题。给定一组同义词（synsets）和带有这些同义词的句子。有必要自动选择句子中的单词的含义。共有1285个句子被专家标注，即专家为目标词选择了其中一个词典的含义。为解决WSD问题，提出了一种基于矢量词上下文近似计算的新方法。为了实现更高的准确度，在句子和同义词集中执行词的初步epsilon过滤。进行了大量的实验。实现了四种算法，包括一种新算法。实验表明，在许多情况下，新算法显示出更好的结果。开发的软件和标签语料库拥有开放的许可证，并可在线获得。使用维基词典和维基文库。可以在幻灯片中查看对这项工作的简要描述（https://goo.gl/9ak6Gt）。有关这项研究的俄语视频讲座可在线获取（https://youtu.be/-DLmRkepf58）。
