##### Abstract
In current study, a mechanism to extract traffic related information such as congestion and incidents from textual data from the internet is proposed. The current source of data is Twitter. As the data being considered is extremely large in size automated models are developed to stream, download, and mine the data in real-time. Furthermore, if any tweet has traffic related information then the models should be able to infer and extract this data. 
 Currently, the data is collected only for United States and a total of 120,000 geo-tagged traffic related tweets are extracted, while six million geo-tagged non-traffic related tweets are retrieved and classification models are trained. Furthermore, this data is used for various kinds of spatial and temporal analysis. A mechanism to calculate level of traffic congestion, safety, and traffic perception for cities in U.S. is proposed. Traffic congestion and safety rankings for the various urban areas are obtained and then they are statistically validated with existing widely adopted rankings. Traffic perception depicts the attitude and perception of people towards the traffic. 
 It is also seen that traffic related data when visualized spatially and temporally provides the same pattern as the actual traffic flows for various urban areas. When visualized at the city level, it is clearly visible that the flow of tweets is similar to flow of vehicles and that the traffic related tweets are representative of traffic within the cities. With all the findings in current study, it is shown that significant amount of traffic related information can be extracted from Twitter and other sources on internet. Furthermore, Twitter and these data sources are freely available and are not bound by spatial and temporal limitations. That is, wherever there is a user there is a potential for data.

##### Abstract (translated by Google)
在当前的研究中，提出了一种从因特网文本数据中提取交通相关信息（如拥塞和事件）的机制。目前的数据来源是Twitter。由于正在考虑的数据量非常大，开发了自动化模型以实时流式传输，下载和挖掘数据。此外，如果有任何鸣叫有交通相关的信息，那么模型应该能够推断和提取这些数据。
 目前，数据仅为美国收集，共提取了12万个地理标记交通相关推文，同时检索了600万个地理标记非交通相关推文，并对分类模型进行了培训。此外，这些数据用于各种时空分析。提出了计算美国城市交通拥堵，安全和交通感知水平的机制。获得各个城市的交通拥堵和安全排名，然后通过现有的广泛采用的排名进行统计验证。交通感知描绘了人们对交通的态度和看法。
 还可以看出，在空间和时间上可视化的交通相关数据提供了与各个城市地区的实际交通流相同的模式。在城市级可视化时，可以清楚地看到推特流量与车辆流量相似，并且交通相关的推特是城市内交通的代表。结合目前研究中的所有发现，可以从Twitter和互联网上的其他来源获得大量与交通有关的信息。此外，Twitter和这些数据源是免费的，不受时空限制。也就是说，无论哪里有用户，都有可能获得数据。
