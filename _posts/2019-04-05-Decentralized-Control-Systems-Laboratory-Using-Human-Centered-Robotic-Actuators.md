##### Abstract
University laboratories deliver unique hands-on experimentation for STEM students but often lack state-of-the-art equipment and provide limited access to their equipment. The University of Texas Cloud Laboratory provides remote access to a cutting-edge series elastic actuators for student experimentation regarding human-centered robotics, dynamical systems, and controls. Through a browser-based interface, students are provided with various learning materials using the remote hardware-in-the-loop system for effective experiment-based education. This paper discusses the methods used to connect remote hardware to mobile browsers, the adaptation of textbook materials regarding system identification and feedback control, data processing to generate clean and useful results for student interpretation, and initial usage of the end-to-end system for individual and group learning.
