##### Abstract
This paper considers the motion planning problem for multiple tethered planar mobile robots. Each robot is attached to a fixed base by a flexible cable. Since the robots share a common workspace, the interactions amongst the robots, cables, and obstacles pose significant difficulties for planning. Previous works have studied the problem of detecting whether a target cable configuration is intersecting (or entangled). Here, we are interested in the motion planning problem: how to plan and coordinate the robot motions to realize a given non-intersecting target cable configuration. We identify four possible modes of motion, depending on whether (i) the robots move in straight lines or following their cable lines; (ii) the robots move sequentially or concurrently. We present an in-depth analysis of Straight &amp; Concurrent, which is the most practically-interesting mode of motion. In particular, we propose algorithms that (a) detect whether a given target cable configuration is realizable by a Straight &amp; Concurrent motion, and (b) return a valid coordinated motion plan. The algorithms are analyzed in detail and validated in simulations and in a hardware experiment.
