##### Abstract
In a recent decade, ImageNet has become the most notable and powerful benchmark database in computer vision and machine learning community. As ImageNet has emerged as a representative benchmark for evaluating the performance of novel deep learning models, its evaluation tends to include only quantitative measures such as error rate, rather than qualitative analysis. Thus, there are few studies that analyze the failure cases of deep learning models in ImageNet, though there are numerous works analyzing the networks themselves and visualizing them. In this abstract, we qualitatively analyze the failure cases of ImageNet classification results from recent deep learning model, and categorize these cases according to the certain image patterns. Through this failure analysis, we believe that it can be discovered what the final challenges are in ImageNet database, which the current deep learning model is still vulnerable to.

##### Abstract (translated by Google)
近十年来，ImageNet已经成为计算机视觉和机器学习领域最显着和最强大的基准数据库。随着ImageNet已经成为评估新型深度学习模型性能的代表性基准，其评估往往只包括定量测量，如错误率而不是定性分析。因此，很少有研究分析ImageNet中的深度学习模型的失败案例，尽管有大量的工作分析网络本身并将其可视化。在这个摘要中，我们定性地分析了来自最近的深度学习模型的ImageNet分类结果的失败情况，并根据一定的图像模式对这些情况进行分类。通过这一失败分析，我们认为可以发现ImageNet数据库面临的最终挑战是什么，目前的深度学习模式依然存在。
