##### Abstract
Convolution has been playing a prominent role in various applications in science and engineering for many years. It is the most important operation in convolutional neural networks. There has been a recent growth of interests of research in generalizing convolutions on curved domains such as manifolds and graphs. However, existing approaches cannot preserve all the desirable properties of Euclidean convolutions, namely compactly supported filters, directionality, transferability across different manifolds. In this paper we develop a new generalization of the convolution operation, referred to as parallel transport convolution (PTC), on Riemannian manifolds and their discrete counterparts. PTC is designed based on the parallel transportation which is able to translate information along a manifold and to intrinsically preserve directionality. PTC allows for the construction of compactly supported filters and is also robust to manifold deformations. This enables us to preform wavelet-like operations and to define deep convolutional neural networks on curved domains.

多年来，卷积一直在科学和工程领域的各种应用中发挥着重要作用。它是卷积神经网络中最重要的操作。近年来，对弯曲域上的卷积进行推广研究（如流形和图形）的兴趣日益增长。然而，现有方法不能保留欧几里德卷积的所有理想性质，即紧密支持的滤波器，方向性，跨不同流形的可转移性。在本文中，我们开发了卷积运算的新概括，称为并行传输卷积（PTC），在黎曼流形及其离散对应物上。 PTC的设计基于平行运输，它能够沿着歧管翻译信息并本质上保持方向性。 PTC允许构造紧凑支撑的过滤器，并且对歧管变形也很有效。这使我们能够进行类小波运算并定义弯曲域上的深度卷积神经网络。
