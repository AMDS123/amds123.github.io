##### Abstract
To design a discretionary access control policy, a technique is proposed that uses the principle of analogies and is based on both the properties of objects and the properties of subjects. As attributes characterizing these properties, the values of the security attributes of subjects and objects are chosen. The concept of precedent is defined as an access rule explicitly specified by the security administrator. The problem of interpolation of the access matrix is formulated: the security administrator defines a sequence of precedents, it is required to automate the process of filling the remaining cells of the access matrix. On the family of sets of security attributes, a linear order is introduced. The principles of filling the access matrix on the basis of analogy with the dominant precedent in accordance with a given order relation are developed. The analysis of the proposed methodology is performed and its main advantages are revealed.
