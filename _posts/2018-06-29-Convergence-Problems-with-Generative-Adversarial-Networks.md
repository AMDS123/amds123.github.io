##### Abstract
Generative adversarial networks (GANs) are a novel approach to generative modelling, a task whose goal it is to learn a distribution of real data points. They have often proved difficult to train: GANs are unlike many techniques in machine learning, in that they are best described as a two-player game between a discriminator and generator. This has yielded both unreliability in the training process, and a general lack of understanding as to how GANs converge, and if so, to what. The purpose of this dissertation is to provide an account of the theory of GANs suitable for the mathematician, highlighting both positive and negative results. This involves identifying the problems when training GANs, and how topological and game-theoretic perspectives of GANs have contributed to our understanding and improved our techniques in recent years.

生成对抗网络（GAN）是一种新颖的生成建模方法，其目的是学习真实数据点的分布。他们经常证明难以训练：GAN与机器学习中的许多技术不同，因为它们最好被描述为鉴别器和发生器之间的双人游戏。这在培训过程中产生了不可靠性，以及对GAN如何衔接以及如何衔接的普遍缺乏理解。本文的目的是提供一个适用于数学家的GAN理论，强调正面和负面的结果。这包括识别GAN培训中的问题，以及GAN的拓扑和博弈论观点如何促进了我们近年来对我们理解和改进技术的贡献。
