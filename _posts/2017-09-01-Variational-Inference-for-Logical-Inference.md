##### Abstract
Functional Distributional Semantics is a framework that aims to learn, from text, semantic representations which can be interpreted in terms of truth. Here we make two contributions to this framework. The first is to show how a type of logical inference can be performed by evaluating conditional probabilities. The second is to make these calculations tractable by means of a variational approximation. This approximation also enables faster convergence during training, allowing us to close the gap with state-of-the-art vector space models when evaluating on semantic similarity. We demonstrate promising performance on two tasks.

功能分配语义是一个框架，旨在从文本中学习可以用真理来解释的语义表示。在这里，我们对这个框架做出两点贡献。首先是展示如何通过评估条件概率来执行一种逻辑推理。其次是通过变分近似来使这些计算易于处理。这种近似也使得训练过程中的收敛速度更快，使我们能够在评估语义相似性时用先进的矢量空间模型缩小差距。我们在两项任务中展现出前景光明
