##### Abstract
We present a cheap, lightweight, and fast fruit counting pipeline that uses a single monocular camera. Our pipeline that relies only on a monocular camera, achieves counting performance comparable to state-of-the-art fruit counting system that utilizes an expensive sensor suite including LiDAR and GPS/INS on a mango dataset. Our monocular camera pipeline begins with a fruit detection component that uses a deep neural network. It then uses semantic structure from motion (SFM) to convert these detections into fruit counts by estimating landmark locations of the fruit in 3D, and using these landmarks to identify double counting scenarios. There are many benefits of developing a low cost and lightweight fruit counting system, including applicability to agriculture in developing countries, where monetary constraints or unstructured environments necessitate cheaper hardware solutions.
