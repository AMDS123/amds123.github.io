##### Abstract
Advancements in Sonar image capture have opened the door to powerful classification schemes for automatic target recognition (ATR. Recent work has particularly seen the application of sparse reconstruction-based classification (SRC) to sonar ATR, which provides compelling accuracy rates even in the presence of noise and blur. Existing sparsity based sonar ATR techniques however assume that the test images exhibit geometric pose that is consistent with respect to the training set. This work addresses the outstanding open challenge of handling inconsistently posed test sonar images relative to training. We develop a new localized block-based dictionary design that can enable geometric, i.e. pose robustness. Further, a dictionary learning method is incorporated to increase performance and efficiency. The proposed SRC with Localized Pose Management (LPM), is shown to outperform the state of the art SIFT feature and SVM approach, due to its power to discern background clutter in Sonar images.

声纳图像捕获的进步为自动目标识别（ATR）打开了强大的分类方案的大门。最近的工作特别是对基于稀疏重建的分类（SRC）应用于声纳ATR，即使在存在噪声和模糊，现有的基于稀疏的声呐ATR技术假定测试图像呈现与训练集相一致的几何姿态，这项工作解决了处理不一致的测试声呐图像相对于训练的突出的开放挑战。新的本地化的基于块的字典设计，可以使几何，即构成鲁棒性。此外，结合字典学习方法来提高性能和效率。所提出的具有局部化姿态管理（LPM）的SRC被示出超越现有技术SIFT特征和支持向量机方法，因为它能够辨别声纳图像中的背景杂波秒。
