##### Abstract
The study of taxonomies and hypernymy relations has been extensive on the Natural Language Processing (NLP) literature. However, the evaluation of taxonomy learning approaches has been traditionally troublesome, as it mainly relies on ad-hoc experiments which are hardly reproducible and manually expensive. Partly because of this, current research has been lately focusing on the hypernymy detection task. In this paper we reflect on this trend, analyzing issues related to current evaluation procedures. Finally, we propose three potential avenues for future work so that is-a relations and resources based on them play a more important role in downstream NLP applications.

自然语言处理（NLP）文献对分类学和上位关系的研究已经有了广泛的研究。然而，对分类学习方法的评估传统上是麻烦的，因为它主要依靠几乎不可重现和手动昂贵的临时实验。部分正因为如此，目前的研究已经集中在上超检测任务上。在本文中，我们反思这一趋势，分析与当前评估程序有关的问题。最后，我们提出了三个潜在的未来工作的途径，这样一来，基于它们的关系和资源在下游的NLP应用中扮演更重要的角色。
