##### Abstract
Zipf's law has been found in many human-related fields, including language, where the frequency of a word is persistently found as a power law function of its frequency rank, known as Zipf's law. However, there is much dispute whether it is a universal law or a statistical artifact, and little is known about what mechanisms may have shaped it. To answer these questions, this study conducted a large scale cross language investigation into Zipf's law. The statistical results show that Zipf's laws in 50 languages all share a 3-segment structural pattern, with each segment demonstrating distinctive linguistic properties and the lower segment invariably bending downwards to deviate from theoretical expectation. This finding indicates that this deviation is a fundamental and universal feature of word frequency distributions in natural languages, not the statistical error of low frequency words. A computer simulation based on the dual-process theory yields Zipf's law with the same structural pattern, suggesting that Zipf's law of natural languages are motivated by common cognitive mechanisms. These results show that Zipf's law in languages is motivated by cognitive mechanisms like dual-processing that govern human verbal behaviors.

Zipf定律已经在许多与人类相关的领域中被发现，包括语言，其中一个词的频率被持续地发现为其频率等级的幂律函数，称为Zipf定律。但是，它是一个普遍的法律还是一个统计工具存在很多争议，而且很少有人知道它可能形成什么样的机制。为了回答这些问题，本研究对Zipf定律进行了大规模的跨语调查。统计结果表明，50种语言的Zipf定律都具有3段结构模式，每个段显示出独特的语言属性，下段始终向下弯曲，偏离理论预期。这一发现表明，这种偏差是自然语言中词频分布的基本和普遍特征，而不是低频词的统计误差。基于双重过程理论的计算机模拟产生具有相同结构模式的Zipf定律，表明Zipf的自然语言定律是由共同的认知机制驱动的。这些结果表明，Zipf在语言中的定律是由诸如管理人类言语行为的双重处理之类的认知机制驱动的。
