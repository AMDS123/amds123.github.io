##### Abstract
Tissue classification is one of the significant tasks in the field of biomedical image analysis. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is of great importance in tissue classification especially in the areas of brain tissue classification which is able to recognize anatomical areas of interest such as surgical planning, monitoring therapy, clinical drug trials, image registration, stereotactic neurosurgery, radiotherapy etc. The task of this paper is to implement different unsupervised classification algorithms in ITK and perform tissue classification (white matter, gray matter, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and background of the human brain). For this purpose, 5 grayscale head MRI scans are provided. In order of classifying brain tissues, three algorithms are used. These are: Otsu thresholding, Bayesian classification and Bayesian classification with Gaussian smoothing. The obtained classification results are analyzed in the results and discussion section.
