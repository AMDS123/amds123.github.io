##### Abstract
Sentence simplification reduces semantic complexity to benefit people with language impairments. Previous simplification studies on the sentence level and word level have achieved promising results but also meet great challenges. For sentence-level studies, sentences after simplification are fluent but sometimes are not really simplified. For word-level studies, words are simplified but also have potential grammar errors due to different usages of words before and after simplification. In this paper, we propose a two-step simplification framework by combining both the word-level and the sentence-level simplifications, making use of their corresponding advantages. Based on the two-step framework, we implement a novel constrained neural generation model to simplify sentences given simplified words. The final results on Wikipedia and Simple Wikipedia aligned datasets indicate that our method yields better performance than various baselines.

##### Abstract (translated by Google)
简化句子减少了语义复杂性，使语言障碍的人受益。之前对句子级别和词汇级别的简化研究取得了可喜的成果，但也面临着巨大的挑战。对于句级研究，简化后的句子流利，但有时并不真正简化。对于单词级别的研究来说，由于单词前后简化的不同用法，单词被简化，但也有潜在的语法错误。在本文中，我们提出了一个两级简化框架，结合了词级和句级简化，利用其相应的优势。基于两步框架，我们实现了一个新的约束神经生成模型，以简化句子简化的句子。维基百科和简单维基百科对齐的数据集的最终结果表明，我们的方法比各种基线的性能更好。
