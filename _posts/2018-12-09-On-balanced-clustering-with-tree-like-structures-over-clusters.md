##### Abstract
The article addresses balanced clustering problems with an additional requirement as a tree-like structure over the obtained balanced clusters. This kind of clustering problems can be useful in some applications (e.g., network design, management and routing). Various types of the initial elements are considered. Four basic greedy-like solving strategies (design framework) are considered: balancing-spanning strategy, spanning-balancing strategy, direct strategy, and design of layered structures with balancing. An extended description of the spanning-balancing strategy is presented including four solving schemes and an illustrative numerical example.
