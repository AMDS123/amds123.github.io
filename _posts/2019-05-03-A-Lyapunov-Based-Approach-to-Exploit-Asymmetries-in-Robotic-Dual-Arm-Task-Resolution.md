##### Abstract
Dual-arm manipulation tasks can be prescribed to a robotic system in terms of desired absolute and relative motion of the robot's end-effectors. These can represent, e.g., jointly carrying a rigid object or performing an assembly task. When both types of motion are to be executed concurrently, the symmetric distribution of the relative motion between arms prevents task conflicts. Conversely, an asymmetric solution to the relative motion task will result in conflicts with the absolute task. In this work, we address the problem of designing a control law for the absolute motion task together with updating the distribution of the relative task among arms. Through a set of numerical results, we contrast our approach with the classical symmetric distribution of the relative motion task to illustrate the advantages of our method.
