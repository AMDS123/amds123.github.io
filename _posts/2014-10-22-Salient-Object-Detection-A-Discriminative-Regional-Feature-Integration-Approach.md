##### Abstract
Salient object detection has been attracting a lot of interest, and recently various heuristic computational models have been designed. In this paper, we formulate saliency map computation as a regression problem. Our method, which is based on multi-level image segmentation, utilizes the supervised learning approach to map the regional feature vector to a saliency score. Saliency scores across multiple levels are finally fused to produce the saliency map. The contributions lie in two-fold. One is that we propose a discriminate regional feature integration approach for salient object detection. Compared with existing heuristic models, our proposed method is able to automatically integrate high-dimensional regional saliency features and choose discriminative ones. The other is that by investigating standard generic region properties as well as two widely studied concepts for salient object detection, i.e., regional contrast and backgroundness, our approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods on six benchmark datasets. Meanwhile, we demonstrate that our method runs as fast as most existing algorithms.

显着物体检测已经引起了很多人的兴趣，最近已经设计了各种启发式计算模型。在本文中，我们将显着图计算形成回归问题。我们的方法是基于多级图像分割，利用监督学习方法将区域特征向量映射到显着性分数。最终将多个层次上的显着性分数融合以产生显着性图。贡献在于双重。一个是我们提出一个区分区域功能集成方法显着物体检测。与现有的启发式模型相比，本文提出的方法能够自动整合高维区域显着特征并选择判别性特征。另一个是通过调查标准通用区属性以及两个被广泛研究的用于显着物体检测的概念，即区域对比度和背景，我们的方法在六个基准数据集上显着优于最先进的方法。同时，我们证明了我们的方法和大多数现有的算法一样快。
