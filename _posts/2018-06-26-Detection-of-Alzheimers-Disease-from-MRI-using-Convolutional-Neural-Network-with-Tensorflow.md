##### Abstract
Nowadays, due to tremendous improvements in high performance computing, it has become easier to train Neural Networks. We intend to take advantage of this situation and apply this technology in solving real world problems. There was a need for automatic diagnosis certain diseases from medical images that could help a doctor and radiologist for further action towards treating the illness. We chose Alzheimer disease for this purpose. Alzheimer disease is the leading cause of dementia and memory loss. Alzheimer disease, it is caused by atrophy of the certain brain regions and by brain cell death. MRI scans reveal this information but atrophy regions are different for different people which makes the diagnosis a little trickier and often gets miss-diagnosed by doctors and radiologists. The Dataset used for this project is provided by OASIS, which contains over 400 subjects 100 of which having mild to severe dementia and is supplemented by MMSE and CDR standards of diagnosis in the same context. Enter CNN, Convolutional Neural Networks are a hybrid of Kernel Convolutions and Neural Networks. Kernel Convolutions is a technique that uses filters to recognize and segment images based on features. Neural Networks consist of neurons which are loosely based on human brains neuron which represents a single classifier and interconnected by weights, have different biases and are activated by some activation functions. By using Convolutional Neural Networks, the problem can be solved with minimal error rate. The technologies we intend to use are libraries like CUDA CuDNN for making use of GPU and its multiple cores-parallel computing to train models while giving us high performance.

现在，由于高性能计算的巨大改进，培训神经网络变得更加容易。我们打算利用这种情况并将此技术应用于解决现实世界的问题。需要从医学图像中自动诊断某些疾病，这可以帮助医生和放射科医生进一步采取行动来治疗疾病。我们为此选择了阿尔茨海默病。阿尔茨海默病是痴呆和记忆丧失的主要原因。阿尔茨海默病是由某些大脑区域的萎缩和脑细胞死亡引起的。 MRI扫描揭示了这些信息，但对于不同的人来说，萎缩区域是不同的，这使得诊断有点棘手，并经常被医生和放射科医师错过诊断。该项目使用的数据集由OASIS提供，其中包含超过400名受试者，其中100名患有轻度至重度痴呆，并在相同背景下由MMSE和CDR诊断标准进行补充。输入CNN，卷积神经网络是核卷积和神经网络的混合体。内核卷积是一种使用滤波器来识别和分割基于特征的图像的技术。神经网络由松散地基于人类大脑神经元的神经元组成，其代表单个分类器并且通过权重相互连接，具有不同的偏差并且由一些激活函数激活。通过使用卷积神经网络，可以以最小的错误率解决问题。我们打算使用的技术是像CUDA CuDNN这样的库，它利用GPU和多核心并行计算来训练模型，同时提供高性能。
