##### Abstract
The implementation of a Structure-from-Motion (SfM) pipeline from a synthetically generated scene as well as the investigation of the faithfulness of diverse reconstructions is the subject of this project. A series of different SfM reconstructions are implemented and their camera pose estimations are being contrasted with their respective ground truth locations. Finally, injection of ground truth location data into the rendered images in order to reduce the estimation error of the camera poses is studied as well.

##### Abstract (translated by Google)
这个项目的主题是从一个综合生成的场景实现一个结构运动（SfM）流水线以及调查各种重建的忠实性。实施一系列不同的SfM重建，并将其相机姿态估计与它们各自的地面真实位置进行对比。最后，将地面真实位置数据注入到渲染图像中，以减少摄像机姿态的估计误差。
