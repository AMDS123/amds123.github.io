##### Abstract
Linguistic relations in oral conversations present how opinions are constructed and developed in a restricted time. The relations bond ideas, arguments, thoughts, and feelings, re-shape them during a speech, and finally build knowledge out of all information provided in the conversation. Speakers share a common interest to discuss. It is expected that each speaker's reply includes duplicated forms of words from previous speakers. However, linguistic adaptation is observed and evolves in a more complex path than just transferring slightly modified versions of common concepts. A conversation aiming a benefit at the end shows an emergent cooperation inducing the adaptation. Not only cooperation, but also competition drives the adaptation or an opposite scenario and one can capture the dynamic process by tracking how the concepts are linguistically linked. To uncover salient complex dynamic events in verbal communications, we attempt to discover self-organized linguistic relations hidden in a conversation with explicitly stated winners and losers. We examine open access data of the United States Supreme Court. Our understanding is crucial in big data research to guide how transition states in opinion mining and decision-making should be modeled and how this required knowledge to guide the model should be pinpointed, by filtering large amount of data.

##### Abstract (translated by Google)
口头交谈中的语言关系表达了​​如何在有限的时间内建立和发展意见。这些关系把想法，论据，思想和感觉联系在一起，在演讲中重新塑造他们，最后从对话中提供的所有信息中建立知识。发言者有共同的兴趣讨论。预计每位发言者的答复都包括前面发言者重复的单词形式。然而，语言适应观察和演变的路径比复杂的概念稍微修改版本要复杂得多。最终目的是为了获得利益而进行的谈话显示出一种促成适应的紧急合作。不仅合作，而且竞争推动了适应或相反的情况，人们可以通过跟踪概念如何在语言上相互联系来捕捉动态过程。为了揭示语言交际中复杂的动态事件，我们试图发现隐藏在明确声明的赢家和输家中的自组织语言关系。我们审查美国最高法院的开放获取数据。我们的理解对于大数据研究至关重要，可以指导如何模拟意见挖掘和决策过程中的转换状态，以及如何通过过滤大量的数据来指导这种需要知识来指导模型。
