##### Abstract
Due to the piezoelectric nature of GaN, the 2DEG in AlGaN/GaN HEMT could be engineered by strain. In this work, SiNx deposited using dual-frequency PECVD was used as a stressor. The output performance of the devices was dominated by the surface passivation instead of the stress effect. However, the threshold voltage was increased by the induced stress, supporting strain engineering as an effective approach to pursue the normally-off operation of AlGaN/GaN HEMTs.
