##### Abstract
Visual learning in the space-time domain remains a very challenging problem in artificial intelligence. Current computational models for understanding video data are heavily rooted in the classical single-image based paradigm. It is not yet well understood how to integrate visual information from space and time into a single, general model. We propose a neural graph model, recurrent in space and time, suitable for capturing both the appearance and the complex interactions of different entities and objects within the changing world scene. Nodes and links in our graph have dedicated neural networks for processing information. Edges process messages between connected nodes at different locations and scales or between past and present time. Nodes compute over features extracted from local parts in space and time and over messages received from their neighbours and previous memory states. Messages are passed iteratively in order to transmit information globally and establish long range interactions. Our model is general and could learn to recognize a variety of high level spatio-temporal concepts and be applied to different learning tasks. We demonstrate, through extensive experiments, a competitive performance over strong baselines on the tasks of recognizing complex patterns of movement in video.
