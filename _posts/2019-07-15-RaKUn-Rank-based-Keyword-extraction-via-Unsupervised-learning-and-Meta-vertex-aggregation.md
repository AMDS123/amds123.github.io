##### Abstract
Keyword extraction is used for summarizing the content of a document and supports efficient document retrieval, and is as such an indispensable part of modern text-based systems. We explore how load centrality, a graph-theoretic measure applied to graphs derived from a given text can be used to efficiently identify and rank keywords. Introducing meta vertices (aggregates of existing vertices) and systematic redundancy filters, the proposed method performs on par with state-of-the-art for the keyword extraction task on 14 diverse datasets. The proposed method is unsupervised, interpretable and can also be used for document visualization.
