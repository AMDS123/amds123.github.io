##### Abstract
An overview of the applications of deep learning in ophthalmic diagnosis using retinal fundus images is presented. We also review various retinal image datasets that can be used for deep learning purposes. Applications of deep learning for segmentation of optic disk, blood vessels and retinal layer as well as detection of lesions are reviewed. Recent deep learning models for classification of diseases such as age-related macular degeneration, glaucoma,diabetic macular edema and diabetic retinopathy are also reported.
