##### Abstract
Existing graph layout algorithms are usually not able to optimize all the aesthetic properties desired in a graph layout. To evaluate how well the desired visual features are reflected in a graph layout, many readability metrics have been proposed in the past decades. However, the calculation of these readability metrics often requires access to the node and edge coordinates and is usually computationally inefficient, especially for dense graphs. Importantly, when the node and edge coordinates are not accessible, it becomes impossible to evaluate the graph layouts quantitatively. In this paper, we present a novel deep learning-based approach to evaluate the readability of graph layouts by directly using graph images. A convolutional neural network architecture is proposed and trained on a benchmark dataset of graph images, which is composed of synthetically-generated graphs and graphs created by sampling from real large networks. Multiple representative readability metrics (including edge crossing, node spread, and group overlap) are considered in the proposed approach. We quantitatively compare our approach to traditional methods and qualitatively evaluate our approach using a case study and visualizing convolutional layers. This work is a first step towards using deep learning based methods to evaluate images from the visualization field quantitatively.

现有的图形布局算法通常不能优化图形布局中所需的所有美学特性。为了评估所需视觉特征在图形布局中的反映程度，过去几十年中已经提出了许多可读性指标。然而，这些可读性度量的计算通常需要访问节点和边缘坐标，并且通常在计算上效率低，尤其对于密集图。重要的是，当节点和边缘坐标不可访问时，无法定量评估图形布局。在本文中，我们提出了一种新颖的基于深度学习的方法，通过直接使用图形图像来评估图形布局的可读性。在图形图像的基准数据集上提出并训练卷积神经网络体系结构，其由通过从真实大型网络采样而创建的综合生成的图形和图形组成。在所提出的方法中考虑了多个代表性可读性度量（包括边缘交叉，节点扩展和组重叠）。我们定量地比较了我们对传统方法的方法，并使用案例研究和可视化卷积层来定性评估我们的方法。这项工作是使用基于深度学习的方法定量评估可视化领域图像的第一步。
