##### Abstract
Extracting the instantaneous heart rate (iHR) from face videos has been well studied in recent years. It is well known that changes in skin color due to blood flow can be captured using conventional cameras. One of the main limitations of methods that rely on this principle is the need of an illumination source. Moreover, they have to be able to operate under different light conditions. One way to avoid these constraints is using infrared cameras, allowing the monitoring of iHR under low light conditions. In this work, we present a simple, principled signal extraction method that recovers the iHR from infrared face videos. We tested the procedure on 7 participants, for whom we recorded an electrocardiogram simultaneously with their infrared face video. We checked that the recovered signal matched the ground truth iHR, showing that infrared is a promising alternative to conventional video imaging for heart rate monitoring, especially in low light conditions.
