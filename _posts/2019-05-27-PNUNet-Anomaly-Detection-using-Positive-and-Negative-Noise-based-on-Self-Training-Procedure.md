##### Abstract
We propose the novel framework for anomaly detection in images. Our new framework, PNUNet, is based on many normal data and few anomalous data. We assume that some noises are added to the input images and learn to remove the noise. In addition, the proposed method achieves significant performance improvement by updating the noise assumed in the inputs using a self-training framework. The experimental results for the benchmark datasets show the usefulness of our new anomaly detection framework.
