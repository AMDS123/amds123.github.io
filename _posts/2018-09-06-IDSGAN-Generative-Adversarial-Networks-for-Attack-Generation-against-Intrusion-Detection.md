##### Abstract
As an important tool in security, the intrusion detection system bears the responsibility of the defense to network attacks performed by malicious traffic. Nowadays, with the help of machine learning algorithms, the intrusion detection system develops rapidly. However, the robustness of this system is questionable when it faces the adversarial attacks. To improve the detection system, more potential attack approaches should be researched. In this paper, a framework of the generative adversarial networks, IDSGAN, is proposed to generate the adversarial attacks, which can deceive and evade the intrusion detection system. Considering that the internal structure of the detection system is unknown to attackers, adversarial attack examples perform the black-box attacks against the detection system. IDSGAN leverages a generator to transform original malicious traffic into adversarial malicious traffic. A discriminator classifies traffic examples and simulates the black-box detection system. More significantly, we only modify part of the attacks' nonfunctional features to guarantee the validity of the intrusion. Based on the dataset NSL-KDD, the feasibility of the model is demonstrated to attack many detection systems with different attacks and the excellent results are achieved. Moreover, the robustness of IDSGAN is verified by changing the amount of the unmodified features.

入侵检测系统作为安全的重要工具，承担着对恶意流量进行网络攻击的防御责任。如今，借助机器学习算法，入侵检测系统迅速发展。然而，当面对敌对攻击时，这个系统的稳健性是值得怀疑的。为了改进检测系统，应该研究更多潜在的攻击方法。在本文中，提出了生成对抗网络IDSGAN的框架来产生对抗性攻击，这可以欺骗和规避入侵检测系统。考虑到攻击者不知道检测系统的内部结构，对抗性攻击示例对检测系统执行黑盒攻击。 IDSGAN利用生成器将原始恶意流量转换为对抗性恶意流量。鉴别器对流量示例进行分类并模拟黑盒检测系统。更重要的是，我们只修改了部分攻击的非功能特性，以保证入侵的有效性。基于NSL-KDD数据集，证明该模型的可行性可以攻击多种不同攻击的检测系统，并取得了优异的效果。此外，通过改变未修改特征的数量来验证IDSGAN的稳健性。
