##### Abstract
In this paper, we presented a preliminary study for tactical driver behavior detection from untrimmed naturalistic driving recordings. While supervised learning based detection is a common approach, it suffers when labeled data is scarce. Manual annotation is both time-consuming and expensive. To emphasize this problem, we experimented on a 104-hour real-world naturalistic driving dataset with a set of predefined driving behaviors annotated. There are three challenges in the dataset. First, predefined driving behaviors are sparse in a naturalistic driving setting. Second, the distribution of driving behaviors is long-tail. Third, a huge intra-class variation is observed. To address these issues, recent self-supervised and supervised learning and fusion of multimodal cues are leveraged into our architecture design. Preliminary experiments and discussions are reported.

在本文中，我们提出了从未修剪的自然驾驶记录中进行战术驾驶员行为检测的初步研究。虽然基于监督学习的检测是一种常见的方法，但是当标记数据稀缺时它会受到影响。手动注释既耗时又昂贵。为了强调这个问题，我们试验了一个104小时的现实世界自然驾驶数据集，其中包含一组预定义的驾驶行为。数据集中有三个挑战。首先，在自然驾驶设置中预定义的驾驶行为是稀疏的。其次，驾驶行为的分布是长尾的。第三，观察到巨大的类内变化。为了解决这些问题，最近的自我监督和监督学习以及多模式线索的融合被用于我们的架构设计中。报告了初步实验和讨论。
