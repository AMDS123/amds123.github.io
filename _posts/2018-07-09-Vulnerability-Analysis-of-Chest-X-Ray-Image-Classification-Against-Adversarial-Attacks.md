##### Abstract
Recently, there have been several successful deep learning approaches for automatically classifying chest X-ray images into different disease categories. However, there is not yet a comprehensive vulnerability analysis of these models against the so-called adversarial perturbations/attacks, which makes deep models more trustful in clinical practices. In this paper, we extensively analyzed the performance of two state-of-the-art classification deep networks on chest X-ray images. These two networks were attacked by three different categories (nine methods in total) of adversarial methods (both white- and black-box), namely gradient-based, score-based, and decision-based attacks. Furthermore, we modified the pooling operations in the two classification networks to measure their sensitivities against different attacks, on the specific task of chest X-ray classification.

最近，已经有几种成功的深度学习方法用于将胸部X射线图像自动分类为不同的疾病类别。然而，对于所谓的对抗性扰动/攻击，尚未对这些模型进行全面的脆弱性分析，这使得深度模型在临床实践中更加可信。在本文中，我们广泛分析了两个最先进的分类深度网络在胸部X射线图像上的性能。这两个网络受到三种不同类别（总共九种方法）的对抗方法（白盒和黑盒）的攻击，即基于梯度的，基于分数的和基于决策的攻击。此外，我们修改了两个分类网络中的池化操作，以测量它们对不同攻击的敏感性，对胸部X射线分类的具体任务进行测量。
