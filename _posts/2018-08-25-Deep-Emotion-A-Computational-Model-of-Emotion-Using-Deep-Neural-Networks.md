##### Abstract
Emotions are very important for human intelligence. For example, emotions are closely related to the appraisal of the internal bodily state and external stimuli. This helps us to respond quickly to the environment. Another important perspective in human intelligence is the role of emotions in decision-making. Moreover, the social aspect of emotions is also very important. Therefore, if the mechanism of emotions were elucidated, we could advance toward the essential understanding of our natural intelligence. In this study, a model of emotions is proposed to elucidate the mechanism of emotions through the computational model. Furthermore, from the viewpoint of partner robots, the model of emotions may help us to build robots that can have empathy for humans. To understand and sympathize with people's feelings, the robots need to have their own emotions. This may allow robots to be accepted in human society. The proposed model is implemented using deep neural networks consisting of three modules, which interact with each other. Simulation results reveal that the proposed model exhibits reasonable behavior as the basic mechanism of emotion.

情绪对人类智能非常重要。例如，情绪与内部身体状态和外部刺激的评估密切相关。这有助于我们快速响应环境。人类智慧的另一个重要观点是情绪在决策中的作用。而且，情绪的社会方面也很重要。因此，如果阐明情绪的机制，我们就可以朝着对自然智慧的基本理解前进。在这项研究中，提出了一种情绪模型，通过计算模型阐明情绪的机制。此外，从伙伴机器人的角度来看，情绪模型可以帮助我们建立能够对人类产生共鸣的机器人。为了理解和同情人们的感受，机器人需要有自己的情感。这可能允许机器人在人类社会中被接受。所提出的模型使用由三个模块组成的深度神经网络实现，这三个模块彼此相互作用。仿真结果表明，所提出的模型表现出合理的行为作为情感的基本机制。
