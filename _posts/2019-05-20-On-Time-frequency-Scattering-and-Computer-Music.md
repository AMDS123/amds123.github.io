##### Abstract
Time-frequency scattering is a mathematical transformation of sound waves. Its core purpose is to mimick the way the human auditory system extracts information from its environment. In the context of improving the artificial intelligence of sounds, it has found succesful applications in automatic speech transcription as well as the recognition of urban sounds and musical sounds. In this article, we show that time-frequency scattering can also be useful for applications in contemporary music creations.
