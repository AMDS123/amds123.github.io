##### Abstract
We propose a framework for localization and classification of masses in breast ultrasound (BUS) images. In particular, we simultaneously use a weakly annotated dataset and a relatively small strongly annotated dataset to train a convolutional neural network detector. We have experimentally found that mass detectors trained with small, strongly annotated datasets are easily overfitted, whereas those trained with large, weakly annotated datasets present a non-trivial problem. To overcome these problems, we jointly use datasets with different characteristics in a hybrid manner. Consequently, a sophisticated weakly and semi-supervised training scenario is introduced with appropriate training loss selection. Experimental results show that the proposed method successfully localizes and classifies masses while requiring less effort in annotation work. The influences of each component in the proposed framework are also validated by conducting an ablative analysis. Although the proposed method is intended for masses in BUS images, it can also be applied as a general framework to train computer-aided detection and diagnosis systems for a wide variety of image modalities, target organs, and diseases.

我们提出了乳腺超声（BUS）图像中的群众定位和分类框架。特别是，我们同时使用弱注释数据集和相对小的强注释数据集来训练卷积神经网络检测器。我们已经通过实验发现，用小的，强注释的数据集训练的质量检测器很容易被过度配置，而那些用大的，弱注释的数据集进行训练的人提出了一个不平凡的问题。为了克服这些问题，我们以混合的方式共同使用具有不同特征的数据集。因此，引入一个复杂的弱和半监督训练方案，并选择适当的训练损失。实验结果表明，该方法成功地对大众进行本地化和分类，同时在注释工作上需要较少的工作量。在所提出的框架中的各个组分的影响也通过进行烧蚀分析来验证。虽然所提出的方法是针对BUS图像中的大众，但它也可以作为通用框架应用于训练用于各种图像形式，靶器官和疾病的计算机辅助检测和诊断系统。
