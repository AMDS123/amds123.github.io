##### Abstract
Advances in fluorescence microscopy enable acquisition of 3D image volumes with better image quality and deeper penetration into tissue. Segmentation is a required step to characterize and analyze biological structures in the images and recent 3D segmentation using deep learning has achieved promising results. One issue is that deep learning techniques require a large set of groundtruth data which is impractical to annotate manually for large 3D microscopy volumes. This paper describes a 3D deep learning nuclei segmentation method using synthetic 3D volumes for training. A set of synthetic volumes and the corresponding groundtruth are generated using spatially constrained cycle-consistent adversarial networks. Segmentation results demonstrate that our proposed method is capable of segmenting nuclei successfully for various data sets.
