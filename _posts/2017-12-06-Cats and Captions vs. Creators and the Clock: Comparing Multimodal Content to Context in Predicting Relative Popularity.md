##### Abstract
The content of today's social media is becoming more and more rich, increasingly mixing text, images, videos, and audio. It is an intriguing research question to model the interplay between these different modes in attracting user attention and engagement. But in order to pursue this study of multimodal content, we must also account for context: timing effects, community preferences, and social factors (e.g., which authors are already popular) also affect the amount of feedback and reaction that social-media posts receive. In this work, we separate out the influence of these non-content factors in several ways. First, we focus on ranking pairs of submissions posted to the same community in quick succession, e.g., within 30 seconds, this framing encourages models to focus on time-agnostic and community-specific content features. Within that setting, we determine the relative performance of author vs. content features. We find that victory usually belongs to "cats and captions," as visual and textual features together tend to outperform identity-based features. Moreover, our experiments show that when considered in isolation, simple unigram text features and deep neural network visual features yield the highest accuracy individually, and that the combination of the two modalities generally leads to the best accuracies overall.

当今社交媒体的内容越来越丰富，文字，图片，视频和音频的混合越来越多。在吸引用户关注和参与方面，模拟这些不同模式之间的相互作用是一个有趣的研究问题。但是为了进行这种多模式内容的研究，我们还必须考虑到上下文：时间效应，社区偏好和社会因素（例如，哪些作者已经很受欢迎）也影响社交媒体帖子收到的反馈和反应的数量。在这项工作中，我们从几个方面分析了这些非内容因素的影响。首先，我们将注意力集中在快速连续发布到同一社区的提交对上，例如，在30秒内，这个框架鼓励模型集中于时间不可知和特定于社区的内容特征。在这种情况下，我们确定作者与内容特征的相对表现。我们发现胜利通常属于“猫和字幕”，因为视觉和文本特征往往会超越基于身份的特征。此外，我们的实验表明，单独考虑时，简单的一元文本特征和深度神经网络视觉特征单独产生最高的精度，并且这两种模式的组合总体上导致最好的精度。
