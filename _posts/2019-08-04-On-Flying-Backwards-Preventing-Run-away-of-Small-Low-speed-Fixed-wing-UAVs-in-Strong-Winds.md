##### Abstract
Small, low-speed fixed-wing Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) operating autonomously, beyond-visual-line-of-sight (BVLOS) will inevitably encounter winds rising to levels near or exceeding the vehicles' nominal airspeed. In this paper, we develop a nonlinear lateral-directional path following guidance law with explicit consideration of online wind estimates. Energy efficient airspeed reference compensation logic is developed for excess wind scenarios (i.e. when the wind speed rises above the airspeed), enabling either mitigation, prevention, or over-powering of excess wind induced run-away from a given path. The developed guidance law is demonstrated on a representative small, low-speed test UAV in two flight experiments conducted in mountainous regions of Switzerland with strong, turbulent wind conditions, gusts reaching up to 13 meters per second. We demonstrate track-keeping errors of less than 1 meter consistently maintained during a representative duration of gusting, excess winds and a mean ground speed undershoot of 0.5 meters per second from the commanded minimum forward ground speed demonstrated in over 5 minutes of the showcased flight results.
