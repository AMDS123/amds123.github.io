##### Abstract
Comparing different algorithms for segmenting glass fibers in industrial computed tomography (CT) scans is difficult due to the absence of a standard reference dataset. In this work, we introduce a set of annotated scans of short-fiber reinforced polymers (SFRP) as well as synthetically created CT volume data together with the evaluation metrics. We suggest both the metrics and this data set as a reference for studying the performance of different algorithms. The real scans were acquired by a Nikon MCT225 X-ray CT system. The simulated scans were created by the use of an in-house computational model and third-party commercial software. For both types of data, corresponding ground truth annotations have been prepared, including hand annotations for the real scans and STL models for the synthetic scans. Additionally, a Hessian-based Frangi vesselness filter for fiber segmentation has been implemented and open-sourced to serve as a reference for comparisons.
