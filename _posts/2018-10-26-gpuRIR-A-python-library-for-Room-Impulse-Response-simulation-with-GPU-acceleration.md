##### Abstract
The Image Source Method (ISM) is one of the most employed techniques to calculate acoustic Room Impulse Responses (RIRs), however, its computational complexity grows fast with the reverberation time of the room and its computation time can be prohibitive for some applications where a huge number of RIRs are needed. In this paper, we present a new implementation that dramatically improves the computation speed of the ISM by using Graphic Processing Units (GPUs) to parallelize both the simulation of multiple RIRs and the computation of the images inside each RIR. We provide a Python library under GNU license that can be easily used without any knowledge about GPU programming and we show that it is about 100 times faster than other state of the art CPU libraries.
