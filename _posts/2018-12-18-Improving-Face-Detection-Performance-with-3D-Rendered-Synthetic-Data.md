##### Abstract
In this paper, we provide a synthetic data generator methodology with fully controlled, multifaceted variations based on a new 3D face dataset (3DU-Face). We customized synthetic datasets to address specific types of variations (scale, pose, occlusion, blur, etc.), and systematically investigate the influence of different variations on face detection performances. We examine whether and how these factors contribute to better face detection performances. We validate our synthetic data augmentation for different face detectors (Faster RCNN, SSH and HR) on various face datasets (MAFA, UFDD and Wider Face).
