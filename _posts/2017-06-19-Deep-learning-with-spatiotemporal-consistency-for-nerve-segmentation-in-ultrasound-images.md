##### Abstract
Ultrasound-Guided Regional Anesthesia (UGRA) has been gaining importance in the last few years, offering numerous advantages over alternative methods of nerve localization (neurostimulation or paraesthesia). However, nerve detection is one of the most tasks that anaesthetists can encounter in the UGRA procedure. Computer aided system that can detect automatically region of nerve, would help practitioner to concentrate more in anaesthetic delivery. In this paper we propose a new method based on deep learning combined with spatiotemporal information to robustly segment the nerve region. The proposed method is based on two phases, localisation and segmentation. The first phase, consists in using convolutional neural network combined with spatial and temporal consistency to detect the nerve zone. The second phase utilises active contour model to delineate the region of interest. Obtained results show the validity of the proposed approach and its robustness.

超声引导的区域麻醉（UGRA）在过去几年已经越来越重要，与神经定位（神经刺激或感觉异常）的替代方法相比，提供了许多优点。然而，神经检测是麻醉师在UGRA程序中可以遇到的最重要的任务之一。能够自动检测神经区域的计算机辅助系统将有助于医生更专注于麻醉剂输送。在本文中，我们提出了一种基于深度学习与时空信息相结合的新方法来强化分割神经区域。该方法是基于两个阶段，本地化和分割。第一阶段是利用卷积神经网络结合空间和时间一致性来检测神经区域。第二阶段利用主动轮廓模型描绘感兴趣的区域。所得结果表明了所提方法的有效性及其鲁棒性。
