##### Abstract
The recent developments in the field of biomedicine have made large volumes of biomedical literature available to the medical practitioners. Due to the large size and lack of efficient searching strategies, medical practitioners struggle to obtain necessary information available in the biomedical literature. Moreover, the most sophisticated search engines of age are not intelligent enough to interpret the clinicians' questions. These facts reflect the urgent need of an information retrieval system that accepts the queries from medical practitioners' in natural language and returns the answers quickly and efficiently. In this paper, we present an implementation of a machine intelligence based CLINIcal Question Answering system (CLINIQA) to answer medical practitioner's questions. The system was rigorously evaluated on different text mining algorithms and the best components for the system were selected. The system makes use of Unified Medical Language System for semantic analysis of both questions and medical documents. In addition, the system employs supervised machine learning algorithms for classification of the documents, identifying the focus of the question and answer selection. Effective domain-specific heuristics are designed for answer ranking. The performance evaluation on hundred clinical questions shows the effectiveness of our approach.

生物医学领域的最新发展使得医生们可以获得大量的生物医学文献。由于规模庞大且缺乏有效的搜索策略，医生们难以获得生物医学文献中的必要信息。此外，年龄最复杂的搜索引擎并不足以解释临床医生的问题。这些事实反映了迫切需要一种信息检索系统，该系统接受来自医生的自然语言询问并快速有效地返回答案。在本文中，我们提出了基于机器智能的CLINIcal Question Answering System（CLINIQA）来解答医生的问题。系统在不同的文本挖掘算法上进行了严格的评估，并选择了系统的最佳组件。该系统利用统一医疗语言系统对问题和医疗文件进行语义分析。此外，该系统采用监督机器学习算法对文件进行分类，确定问题和答案选择的重点。有效的特定于领域的启发式是为回答排名而设计的。对数百个临床问题的绩效评估显示了我们方法的有效性。
