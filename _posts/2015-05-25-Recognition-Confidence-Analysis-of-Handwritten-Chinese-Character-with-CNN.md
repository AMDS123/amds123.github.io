##### Abstract
In this paper, we present an effective method to analyze the recognition confidence of handwritten Chinese character, based on the softmax regression score of a high performance convolutional neural networks (CNN). Through careful and thorough statistics of 827,685 testing samples that randomly selected from total 8836 different classes of Chinese characters, we find that the confidence measurement based on CNN is an useful metric to know how reliable the recognition results are. Furthermore, we find by experiments that the recognition confidence can be used to find out similar and confusable character-pairs, to check wrongly or cursively written samples, and even to discover and correct mis-labelled samples. Many interesting observations and statistics are given and analyzed in this study.

本文基于高性能卷积神经网络（CNN）的softmax回归分数，提出一种分析手写体汉字识别置信度的有效方法。通过对从8836个不同类别的汉字中随机选取的827685个测试样本进行认真和全面的统计，我们发现基于CNN的置信度测量是了解识别结果有多可靠的有用指标。此外，我们通过实验发现，识别置信度可以用来找出相似和易混淆的字符对，检查错误或草书写的样本，甚至发现和纠正错误标记的样本。本研究给出了许多有趣的观察和统计数据。
