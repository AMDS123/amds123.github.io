##### Abstract
Periocular refers to the region around the eye, including sclera, eyelids, lashes, brows and skin. With a surprisingly high discrimination ability, it is the ocular modality requiring the least constrained acquisition. Here, we apply existing pre-trained architectures, proposed in the context of the ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge, to the task of periocular recognition. These have proven to be very successful for many other computer vision tasks apart from the detection and classification tasks for which they were designed. Experiments are done with a database of periocular images captured with a digital camera. We demonstrate that these off-the-shelf CNN features can effectively recognize individuals based on periocular images, despite being trained to classify generic objects. Compared against reference periocular features, they show an EER reduction of up to ~40%, with the fusion of CNN and traditional features providing additional improvements.

眼周是指眼睛周围的区域，包括巩膜，眼睑，睫毛，眉毛和皮肤。具有令人惊讶的高辨别能力，是需要最少约束获取的眼睛模态。在这里，我们将在ImageNet大规模视觉识别挑战的背景下提出的现有预训练架构应用于眼周识别的任务。除了设计它们的检测和分类任务之外，这些已被证明对许多其他计算机视觉任务非常成功。使用数码相机捕获的眼周图像数据库进行实验。我们证明了这些现成的CNN功能可以基于眼周图像有效地识别个体，尽管经过训练可以对通用对象进行分类。与参考眼周特征相比，它们显示EER减少高达~40％，CNN与传统特征的融合提供了额外的改进。
