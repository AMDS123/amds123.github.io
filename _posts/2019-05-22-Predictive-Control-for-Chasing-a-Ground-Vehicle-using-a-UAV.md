##### Abstract
We propose a high-level planner for a multirotor to chase a ground vehicle, while simultaneously respecting various state and input constraints. Assuming a minimal kinematic model for the ground vehicle, we use data collected online to generate predictions for our planner within a model predictive control framework. Our solution is demonstrated, both via simulations and experiments on a stable quadcopter platform.
