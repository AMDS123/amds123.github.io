##### Abstract
Recently, impressive denoising results have been achieved by Bayesian approaches which assume Gaussian models for the image patches. This improvement in performance can be attributed to the use of per-patch models. Unfortunately such an approach is particularly unstable for most inverse problems beyond denoising. In this work, we propose the use of a hyperprior to model image patches, in order to stabilize the estimation procedure. There are two main advantages to the proposed restoration scheme: Firstly it is adapted to diagonal degradation matrices, and in particular to missing data problems (e.g. inpainting of missing pixels or zooming). Secondly it can deal with signal dependent noise models, particularly suited to digital cameras. As such, the scheme is especially adapted to computational photography. In order to illustrate this point, we provide an application to high dynamic range imaging from a single image taken with a modified sensor, which shows the effectiveness of the proposed scheme.

最近，贝叶斯方法已经实现了令人印象深刻的去噪效果，该方法假设图像块的高斯模型。性能的提高可以归因于每个补丁模型的使用。不幸的是，这种方法对于除去噪声之外的大多数反问题是特别不稳定的。在这项工作中，我们建议使用hyperprior来建模图像块，以便稳定估计过程。所提出的恢复方案有两个主要的优点：第一，它适用于对角线退化矩阵，特别是丢失数据问题（例如缺失像素的修补或缩放）。其次它可以处理与信号有关的噪声模型，特别适用于数码相机。因此，该方案特别适用于计算摄影。为了说明这一点，我们提供了一个应用到高动态范围成像从一个单一的图像采取了修改传感器，这表明了提出的方案的有效性。
