##### Abstract
We study the problem of answering questions about images in the harder setting, where the test questions and corresponding images contain novel objects, which were not queried about in the training data. Such setting is inevitable in real world-owing to the heavy tailed distribution of the visual categories, there would be some objects which would not be annotated in the train set. We show that the performance of two popular existing methods drop significantly (up to 28%) when evaluated on novel objects cf. known objects. We propose methods which use large existing external corpora of (i) unlabeled text, i.e. books, and (ii) images tagged with classes, to achieve novel object based visual question answering. We do systematic empirical studies, for both an oracle case where the novel objects are known textually, as well as a fully automatic case without any explicit knowledge of the novel objects, but with the minimal assumption that the novel objects are semantically related to the existing objects in training. The proposed methods for novel object based visual question answering are modular and can potentially be used with many visual question answering architectures. We show consistent improvements with the two popular architectures and give qualitative analysis of the cases where the model does well and of those where it fails to bring improvements.

我们研究了在较难的环境下回答关于图像的问题的问题，其中测试题和相应的图像包含在训练数据中未被查询的新对象。这样的背景在现实世界中是不可避免的 - 由于视觉类别的尾巴分布严重，会有一些物品在列车上不予注释。我们表明，两种流行的现有方法的性能下降显着（高达28％）时评价新颖的对象比较。已知的物体。我们提出了使用大量现有外部语料库（i）未标记的文本（即书籍）和（ii）用类标记的图像来实现基于对象的新颖视觉问题回答的方法。我们进行系统的实证研究，对于新颖的对象是文本知识的情况下的oracle情况，以及没有任何新颖对象的明确知识的全自动情况，但是最小的假设是新的对象在语义上与现有的培训对象。所提出的新颖的基于对象的视觉问题回答方法是模块化的，并且可以用于许多视觉问题回答体系结构。我们展示了两种流行体系结构的一致性改进，并对模型运行良好的情况以及未能改善的情况进行定性分析。
