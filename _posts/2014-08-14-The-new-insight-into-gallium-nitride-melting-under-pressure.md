##### Abstract
Results solving the long standing puzzle regarding the phase diagram and the pressure evolution of the melting temperature Tm(P) of gallium nitride (GaN), the most promising semiconducting material for innovative modern electronic applications, are presented. The analysis is based on (i) studies of the decomposition curve in P-T plane up to challenging P equal 9 GPa, (ii) novel method enabling Tm(P) determination despite the earlier decomposition, and (iii) the pressure invariant parameterization of Tm(P) curve, showing the reversal melting for P greater-than 22 GPa. This is linked to a possible fluid-fluid crossover under extreme pressures and temperatures. The importance of results for the development of GaN based technologies is indicated.
