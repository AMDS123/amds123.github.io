##### Abstract
The rise and fall of artificial neural networks is well documented in the scientific literature of both computer science and computational chemistry. Yet almost two decades later, we are now seeing a resurgence of interest in deep learning, a machine learning algorithm based on multilayer neural networks. Within the last few years, we have seen the transformative impact of deep learning in many domains, particularly in speech recognition and computer vision, to the extent that the majority of expert practitioners in those field are now regularly eschewing prior established models in favor of deep learning models. In this review, we provide an introductory overview into the theory of deep neural networks and their unique properties that distinguish them from traditional machine learning algorithms used in cheminformatics. By providing an overview of the variety of emerging applications of deep neural networks, we highlight its ubiquity and broad applicability to a wide range of challenges in the field, including QSAR, virtual screening, protein structure prediction, quantum chemistry, materials design and property prediction. In reviewing the performance of deep neural networks, we observed a consistent outperformance against non-neural networks state-of-the-art models across disparate research topics, and deep neural network based models often exceeded the "glass ceiling" expectations of their respective tasks. Coupled with the maturity of GPU-accelerated computing for training deep neural networks and the exponential growth of chemical data on which to train these networks on, we anticipate that deep learning algorithms will be a valuable tool for computational chemistry.

人工神经网络的兴衰在计算机科学和计算化学的科学文献中都有很好的记载。然而近二十年后，我们现在看到对深度学习的兴趣再度兴起，这是一种基于多层神经网络的机器学习算法。在过去的几年里，我们已经看到了深度学习在许多领域的变革性影响，特别是在语音识别和计算机视觉领域，这些领域的大多数专业从业者现在经常回避先前建立的模型，而不是深入学习。学习模式。在这篇综述中，我们提供了深度神经网络理论及其独特属性的介绍性概述，这些属性将其与化学信息学中使用的传统机器学习算法区分开来。通过概述深部神经网络的各种新兴应用，我们强调其广泛适用于该领域的广泛挑战，包括QSAR，虚拟筛选，蛋白质结构预测，量子化学，材料设计和性能预测。在回顾深度神经网络的性能时，我们观察到在不同的研究主题中针对非神经网络的最先进模型的一致优异性，并且基于深度神经网络的模型经常超出其各自任务的“玻璃天花板”期望。再加上用于训练深度神经网络的GPU加速计算的成熟度以及用于训练这些网络的化学数据的指数增长，我们预计深度学习算法将成为计算化学的有价值工具。
