##### Abstract
Modern day multimedia content generation and dissemination is moving towards the presentation of more and more `realistic' scenarios. The switch from 2-dimensional (2D) to 3-dimensional (3D) has been a major driving force in that direction. Over the recent past, a large number of approaches have been proposed for creating 3D images/videos most of which are based on the generation of depth-maps. This paper presents a new algorithm for obtaining depth information pertaining to a depicted scene from a set of available pair of stereoscopic images. The proposed algorithm performs a pixel-to-pixel matching of the two images in the stereo pair for estimation of depth. It is shown that the obtained depth-maps show improvements over the reported counterparts.
