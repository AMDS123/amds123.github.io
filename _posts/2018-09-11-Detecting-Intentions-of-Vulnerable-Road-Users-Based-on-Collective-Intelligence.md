##### Abstract
Vulnerable road users (VRUs, i.e. cyclists and pedestrians) will play an important role in future traffic. To avoid accidents and achieve a highly efficient traffic flow, it is important to detect VRUs and to predict their intentions. In this article a holistic approach for detecting intentions of VRUs by cooperative methods is presented. The intention detection consists of basic movement primitive prediction, e.g. standing, moving, turning, and a forecast of the future trajectory. Vehicles equipped with sensors, data processing systems and communication abilities, referred to as intelligent vehicles, acquire and maintain a local model of their surrounding traffic environment, e.g. crossing cyclists. Heterogeneous, open sets of agents (cooperating and interacting vehicles, infrastructure, e.g. cameras and laser scanners, and VRUs equipped with smart devices and body-worn sensors) exchange information forming a multi-modal sensor system with the goal to reliably and robustly detect VRUs and their intentions under consideration of real time requirements and uncertainties. The resulting model allows to extend the perceptual horizon of the individual agent beyond their own sensory capabilities, enabling a longer forecast horizon. Concealments, implausibilities and inconsistencies are resolved by the collective intelligence of cooperating agents. Novel techniques of signal processing and modelling in combination with analytical and learning based approaches of pattern and activity recognition are used for detection, as well as intention prediction of VRUs. Cooperation, by means of probabilistic sensor and knowledge fusion, takes place on the level of perception and intention recognition. Based on the requirements of the cooperative approach for the communication a new strategy for an ad hoc network is proposed.

弱势道路使用者（VRU，即骑自行车者和行人）将在未来的交通中发挥重要作用。为了避免事故并实现高效的交通流量，检测VRU并预测其意图非常重要。在本文中，提出了一种通过协作方法检测VRU意图的整体方法。意图检测包括基本运动原语预测，例如，站立，移动，转弯和对未来轨迹的预测。配备有传感器，数据处理系统和通信能力的车辆，被称为智能车辆，获取并维护其周围交通环境的本地模型，例如，穿越自行车手。异构，开放的代理（协作和交互的车辆，基础设施，例如摄像机和激光扫描仪，以及配备有智能设备和体佩传感器的VRU）交换形成多模态传感器系统的信息，目的是可靠且稳健地检测VRU以及他们在考虑实时要求和不确定性的意图。由此产生的模型允许将个体代理的感知范围扩展到超出其自身的感官能力，从而实现更长的预测范围。合作代理人的集体智慧解决了隐瞒，不可信和不一致的问题。结合基于分析和学习的模式和活动识别方法的信号处理和建模的新技术被用于检测以及VRU的意图预测。通过概率传感器和知识融合的合作发生在感知和意图识别的层面上。基于协作方法对通信的要求，提出了一种新的ad hoc网络策略。
