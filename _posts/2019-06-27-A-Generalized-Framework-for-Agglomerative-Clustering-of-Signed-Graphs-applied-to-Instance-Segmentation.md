##### Abstract
We propose a novel theoretical framework that generalizes algorithms for hierarchical agglomerative clustering to weighted graphs with both attractive and repulsive interactions between the nodes. This framework defines GASP, a Generalized Algorithm for Signed graph Partitioning, and allows us to explore many combinations of different linkage criteria and cannot-link constraints. We prove the equivalence of existing clustering methods to some of those combinations, and introduce new algorithms for combinations which have not been studied. An extensive comparison is performed to evaluate properties of the clustering algorithms in the context of instance segmentation in images, including robustness to noise and efficiency. We show how one of the new algorithms proposed in our framework outperforms all previously known agglomerative methods for signed graphs, both on the competitive CREMI 2016 EM segmentation benchmark and on the CityScapes dataset.
