##### Abstract
Machine learning solutions, in particular those based on deep learning methods, form an underpinning of the current revolution in "artificial intelligence" that has dominated popular press headlines and is having a significant influence on the wider tech agenda. Here we give an overview of the 3Ds of ML systems design: Data, Design and Deployment. By considering the 3Ds we can move towards \emph{data first} design.
