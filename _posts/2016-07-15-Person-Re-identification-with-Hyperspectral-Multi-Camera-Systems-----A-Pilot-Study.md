##### Abstract
Person re-identification in a multi-camera environment is an important part of modern surveillance systems. Person re-identification from color images has been the focus of much active research, due to the numerous challenges posed with such analysis tasks, such as variations in illumination, pose and viewpoints. In this paper, we suggest that hyperspectral imagery has the potential to provide unique information that is expected to be beneficial for the re-identification task. Specifically, we assert that by accurately characterizing the unique spectral signature for each person's skin, hyperspectral imagery can provide very useful descriptors (e.g. spectral signatures from skin pixels) for re-identification. Towards this end, we acquired proof-of-concept hyperspectral re-identification data under challenging (practical) conditions from 15 people. Our results indicate that hyperspectral data result in a substantially enhanced re-identification performance compared to color (RGB) images, when using spectral signatures over skin as the feature descriptor.

在多摄像机环境中重新识别人员是现代监控系统的重要组成部分。由于诸如照明，姿势和观点的变化这样的分析任务带来了诸多挑战，所以从彩色图像中重新识别人类已经成为许多积极研究的焦点。在本文中，我们建议高光谱图像有可能提供独特的信息，预计将有利于重新识别任务。具体而言，我们断言，通过准确地表征每个人的皮肤的独特光谱特征，高光谱图像可以提供非常有用的描述符（例如，来自皮肤像素的光谱特征）用于重新识别。为此，我们在15人的挑战性（实际）条件下获取概念验证高光谱重新识别数据。我们的研究结果表明，高光谱数据导致与颜色（RGB）图像相比，当使用皮肤上的光谱特征作为特征描述符时，重新识别性能显着增强。
