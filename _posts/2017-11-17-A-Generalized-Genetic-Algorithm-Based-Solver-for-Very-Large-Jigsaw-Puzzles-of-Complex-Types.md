##### Abstract
In this paper we introduce new types of square-piece jigsaw puzzles, where in addition to the unknown location and orientation of each piece, a piece might also need to be flipped. These puzzles, which are associated with a number of real world problems, are considerably harder, from a computational standpoint. Specifically, we present a novel generalized genetic algorithm (GA)-based solver that can handle puzzle pieces of unknown location and orientation (Type 2 puzzles) and (two-sided) puzzle pieces of unknown location, orientation, and face (Type 4 puzzles). To the best of our knowledge, our solver provides a new state-of-the-art, solving previously attempted puzzles faster and far more accurately, handling puzzle sizes that have never been attempted before, and assembling the newly introduced two-sided puzzles automatically and effectively. This paper also presents, among other results, the most extensive set of experimental results, compiled as of yet, on Type 2 puzzles.

在本文中，我们介绍一种新型的方块拼图游戏，除了每个棋子的未知位置和方向之外，还可能需要翻转棋子。从计算的观点来看，这些与许多现实世界问题相关的难题是相当困难的。具体来说，我们提出了一种新颖的基于遗传算法（GA）的解算器，可以处理未知位置和方向（类型2拼图）和（双面）未知位置，方向和面部拼图（类型4拼图）。据我们所知，我们的求解器提供了一种新的先进技术，能够更快，更准确地解决以前尝试过的难题，处理之前从未尝试过的难题，以及自动组装新推出的双面拼图并有效地。除此之外，本文还介绍了迄今编纂的最广泛的一组实验结果。
