##### Abstract
Although event-based cameras are already commercially available. Vision algorithms based on them are still not common. As a consequence, there are few Hardware Accelerators for them. In this work we present some experiments to create FPGA accelerators for a well-known vision algorithm using event-based cameras. We present a stereo matching algorithm to create a stream of disparity events disparity map and implement several accelerators using the Intel FPGA OpenCL tool-chain. The results show that multiple designs can be easily tested and that a performance speedup of more than 8x can be achieved with simple code transformations.
