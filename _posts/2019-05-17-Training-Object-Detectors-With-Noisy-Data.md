##### Abstract
The availability of a large quantity of labelled training data is crucial for the training of modern object detectors. Hand labelling training data is time consuming and expensive while automatic labelling methods inevitably add unwanted noise to the labels. We examine the effect of different types of label noise on the performance of an object detector. We then show how co-teaching, a method developed for handling noisy labels and previously demonstrated on a classification problem, can be improved to mitigate the effects of label noise in an object detection setting. We illustrate our results using simulated noise on the KITTI dataset and on a vehicle detection task using automatically labelled data.
