##### Abstract
In this letter, we report on a unique device design strategy for increasing the breakdown voltage and hence Baliga Figure of Merit (BFOM) of III-nitride HEMTs by engineering the gate edge towards the drain. The breakdown of such devices with meandering gate-drain access region (M-HEMT) are found to be 62% more compared to that of conventional HEMT while the ON resistance suffers by 76%, leading to an overall improvement in the BFOM for by 28%. 3D-TCAD simulations show that the decrease in the peak electric field at the gate edge was responsible for increased breakdown voltage.
