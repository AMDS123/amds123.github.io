##### Abstract
Proving ground, or on-track testing has been an essential part of testing and validation process for connected and autonomous vehicles (CAV). Several world-class CAV proving grounds, such as Mcity at the University of Michigan and The Castle of Waymo, have already been built, and many more are currently under construction. In this paper, we propose the first optimization approach to CAV proving ground designing and refer to any such CAV-centric design problem as "Xcity" to emphasize the enormous investment, the multi-dimensional spatial consideration, and the immense construction effort emerging globally. Inspired by the recent progress on traffic encounter clustering, we further define "road assets" as fundamental building blocks and formulate the whole design process into nonlinear optimization problems. We have shown that such framework can be utilized to adaptively generate CAV proving ground designs with optimized capability and flexibility and can further be extended to evaluate an existing "Xcity" design.

试验场或在轨测试一直是连接和自动驾驶车辆（CAV）测试和验证过程的重要组成部分。几个世界级的CAV试验场，如密歇根大学的Mcity和Waymo城堡，已经建成，还有更多正在建设中。在本文中，我们提出了第一个CAV证明地面设计的优化方法，并将任何这样的以CAV为中心的设计问题称为“Xcity”，以强调全球出现的巨大投资，多维空间考虑和巨大的建设努力。受近期交通遭遇聚类进展的启发，我们进一步将“道路资产”定义为基本构建模块，并将整个设计过程制定为非线性优化问题。我们已经证明，这种框架可以用于自适应地生成具有优化能力和灵活性的CAV试验场设计，并且可以进一步扩展以评估现有的“Xcity”设计。
