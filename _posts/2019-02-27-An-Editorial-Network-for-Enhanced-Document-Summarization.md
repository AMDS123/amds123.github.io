##### Abstract
We suggest a new idea of Editorial Network - a mixed extractive-abstractive summarization approach, which is applied as a post-processing step over a given sequence of extracted sentences. Our network tries to imitate the decision process of a human editor during summarization. Within such a process, each extracted sentence may be either kept untouched, rephrased or completely rejected. We further suggest an effective way for training the "editor" based on a novel soft-labeling approach. Using the CNN/DailyMail dataset we demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach compared to state-of-the-art extractive-only or abstractive-only baseline methods.
