##### Abstract
Several papers have recently contained reports on applying machine learning (ML) to the automation of software engineering (SE) tasks, such as project management, modeling and development. However, there appear to be no approaches comparing how software engineers fare against machine-learning algorithms as applied to specific software development tasks. Such a comparison is essential to gain insight into which tasks are better performed by humans and which by machine learning and how cooperative work or human-in-the-loop processes can be implemented more effectively. In this paper, we present an empirical study that compares how software engineers and machine-learning algorithms perform and reuse tasks. The empirical study involves the synthesis of the control structure of an autonomous streetlight application. Our approach consists of four steps. First, we solved the problem using machine learning to determine specific performance and reuse tasks. Second, we asked software engineers with different domain knowledge levels to provide a solution to the same tasks. Third, we compared how software engineers fare against machine-learning algorithms when accomplishing the performance and reuse tasks based on criteria such as energy consumption and safety. Finally, we analyzed the results to understand which tasks are better performed by either humans or algorithms so that they can work together more effectively. Such an understanding and the resulting human-in-the-loop approaches, which take into account the strengths and weaknesses of humans and machine-learning algorithms, are fundamental not only to provide a basis for cooperative work in support of software engineering, but also, in other areas.

最近几篇论文报道了将机器学习（ML）应用于软件工程（SE）任务自动化（如项目管理，建模和开发）的报告。然而，似乎没有办法比较软件工程师如何应对机器学习算法，并将其应用于特定的软件开发任务。这样的比较对于深入了解哪些任务能够更好地被人类执行以及通过机器学习以及如何更有效地实施合作性工作或人员在回路过程是至关重要的。在本文中，我们提出一个实证研究，比较软件工程师和机器学习算法如何执行和重用任务。实证研究涉及自治街灯应用的控制结构的综合。我们的方法包括四个步骤。首先，我们使用机器学习来解决问题，以确定具体的性能和重用任务。其次，我们要求具有不同领域知识水平的软件工程师为相同的任务提供解决方案。第三，我们比较了软件工程师在根据能耗和安全等标准完成性能和重用任务时如何应对机器学习算法。最后，我们分析了结果，以便了解哪些任务能够更好地被人类或算法执行，以便他们能够更有效地一起工作。这样的理解以及考虑到人类和机器学习算法的长处和短处的人为回路方法，不仅是为支持软件工程的合作工作提供基础， ，在其他地区。
