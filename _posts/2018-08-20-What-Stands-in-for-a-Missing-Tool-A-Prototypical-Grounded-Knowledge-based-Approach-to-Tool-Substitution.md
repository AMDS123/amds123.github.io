##### Abstract
When a robot is operating in a dynamic environment, it cannot be assumed that a tool required to solve a given task will always be available. In case of a missing tool, an ideal response would be to find a substitute to complete the task. In this paper, we present a proof of concept of a grounded knowledge-based approach to tool substitution. In order to validate the suitability of a substitute, we conducted experiments involving 22 substitution scenarios. The substitutes computed by the proposed approach were validated on the basis of the experts' choices for each scenario. Our evaluation showed, in 63% scenarios, the approach identified exactly the same substitutes as experts.

当机器人在动态环境中运行时，不能假定解决给定任务所需的工具始终可用。如果缺少工具，理想的响应是找到替代来完成任务。在本文中，我们提出了基于知识的工具替代方法的概念证明。为了验证替代品的适用性，我们进行了涉及22种替代方案的实验。根据专家对每种情景的选择，验证了拟议方法计算出的替代方案。我们的评估显示，在63％的情景中，该方法确定了与专家完全相同的替代品。
