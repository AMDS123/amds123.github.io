##### Abstract
Sound synthesis is a complex field that requires domain expertise. Manual tuning of synthesizer parameters to match a specific sound can be an exhaustive task, even for experienced sound engineers. In this paper, we propose an automatic method for synthesizer parameters tuning to match a given input sound. The method is based on strided Convolutional Neural Networks and is capable of inferring the synthesizer parameters configuration from the input spectrogram and even from the raw audio. The effectiveness of our method is demonstrated on a subtractive synthesizer with four frequency modulated oscillators, envelope generator and a gater effect. We present extensive quantitative and qualitative results that showcase the superiority of our model over several baselines. Furthermore, we show that the network depth is an important factor that contributes to the prediction accuracy.
