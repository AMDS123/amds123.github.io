##### Abstract
This article reviews recent advances in applying natural language processing (NLP) to Electronic Health Records (EHRs) for computational phenotyping. NLP-based computational phenotyping has numerous applications including diagnosis categorization, novel phenotype discovery, clinical trial screening, pharmacogenomics, drug-drug interaction (DDI) and adverse drug event (ADE) detection, as well as genome-wide and phenome-wide association studies. Significant progress has been made in algorithm development and resource construction for computational phenotyping. Among the surveyed methods, well-designed keyword search and rule-based systems often achieve good performance. However, the construction of keyword and rule lists requires significant manual effort, which is difficult to scale. Supervised machine learning models have been favored because they are capable of acquiring both classification patterns and structures from data. Recently, deep learning and unsupervised learning have received growing attention, with the former favored for its performance and the latter for its ability to find novel phenotypes. Integrating heterogeneous data sources have become increasingly important and have shown promise in improving model performance. Often better performance is achieved by combining multiple modalities of information. Despite these many advances, challenges and opportunities remain for NLP-based computational phenotyping, including better model interpretability and generalizability, and proper characterization of feature relations in clinical narratives

##### Abstract (translated by Google)
本文回顾了将自然语言处理（NLP）应用于电子健康记录（EHR）以进行计算表型分析的最新进展。基于NLP的计算表型分析有许多应用，包括诊断分类，新型表型发现，临床试验筛选，药物基因组学，药物相互作用（DDI）和药物不良事件（ADE）检测，以及全基因组和全基因组关联研究。计算表型的算法开发和资源构建已取得重大进展。在所调查的方法中，精心设计的关键字搜索和基于规则的系统通常可以获得良好的性能。但是，关键字和规则列表的构建需要大量的手动工作，这很难扩展。受监督的机器学习模型受到青睐，因为它们能够从数据中获取分类模式和结构。最近，深度学习和无监督学习受到越来越多的关注，前者对其表现有利，后者则因其能够发现新型表型而受到关注。整合异构数据源变得越来越重要，并显示出提高模型性能的承诺。通常情况下，通过组合多种信息模式可以获得更好的性能。尽管取得了许多进展，但基于NLP的计算表型仍存在挑战和机遇，包括更好的模型可解释性和一般性，以及临床叙述中特征关系的正确表征
