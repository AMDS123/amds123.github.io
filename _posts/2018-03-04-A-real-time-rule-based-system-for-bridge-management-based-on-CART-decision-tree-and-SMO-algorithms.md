##### Abstract
To real-time management of the bridges under dynamic conditions, this paper develops a rule-based decision support framework to extract the necessary rules from simulation results made by Aimsun. In this rule-based system, the supervised and the unsupervised learning algorithms are applied to generalize the rules where the initial set of rules are provided by the aid of fuzzy rule generation algorithms on the results of Aimsun traffic micro-simulation software. As a pilot case study, Nasr Bridge in Tehran is simulated in Aimsun7 and WEKA data mining software is used to execute the learning algorithms. Based on this experiment, the accuracy of the supervised algorithms to generalize the rules is greater than 80%. In addition, CART decision tree and sequential minimal optimization (SMO) provides 100% accuracy for normal data and so these algorithms are so reliable for crisis management on bridge. This means that, it is possible to use such machine learning methods to manage bridges in the real-time conditions.

为了在动态条件下实时管理桥梁，本文开发了一个基于规则的决策支持框架，以从Aimsun的仿真结果中提取必要的规则。在这种基于规则的系统中，监督学习算法和无监督学习算法被应用于推广规则，其中通过模糊规则生成算法对Aimsun交通微观仿真软件的结果提供初始规则集。作为一个试点案例研究，德黑兰的纳斯尔桥在Aimsun7中被模拟，并且WEKA数据挖掘软件被用来执行学习算法。基于这个实验，监督算法推广规则的准确率大于80％。此外，CART决策树和顺序最小优化（SMO）为普通数据提供了100％的准确性，因此这些算法对桥梁危机管理非常可靠。这意味着，可以使用这种机器学习方法在实时条件下管理网桥。
