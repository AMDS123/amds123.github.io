##### Abstract
Objective: The advent of Electronic Medical Records (EMR) with large electronic imaging databases along with advances in deep neural networks with machine learning has provided a unique opportunity to achieve milestones in automated image analysis. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) is the most commonly obtained imaging modality in ophthalmology and represents a dense and rich dataset when combined with labels derived from the EMR. We sought to determine if deep learning could be utilized to distinguish normal OCT images from images from patients with Age-related Macular Degeneration (AMD). Methods: Automated extraction of an OCT imaging database was performed and linked to clinical endpoints from the EMR. OCT macula scans were obtained by Heidelberg Spectralis, and each OCT scan was linked to EMR clinical endpoints extracted from EPIC. The central 11 images were selected from each OCT scan of two cohorts of patients: normal and AMD. Cross-validation was performed using a random subset of patients. Area under receiver operator curves (auROC) were constructed at an independent image level, macular OCT level, and patient level. Results: Of an extraction of 2.6 million OCT images linked to clinical datapoints from the EMR, 52,690 normal and 48,312 AMD macular OCT images were selected. A deep neural network was trained to categorize images as either normal or AMD. At the image level, we achieved an auROC of 92.78% with an accuracy of 87.63%. At the macula level, we achieved an auROC of 93.83% with an accuracy of 88.98%. At a patient level, we achieved an auROC of 97.45% with an accuracy of 93.45%. Peak sensitivity and specificity with optimal cutoffs were 92.64% and 93.69% respectively. Conclusions: Deep learning techniques are effective for classifying OCT images. These findings have important implications in utilizing OCT in automated screening and computer aided diagnosis tools.

目标：带有大型电子成像数据库的电子医疗记录（EMR）的出现，随着机器学习的深度神经网络的发展，为实现自动图像分析中的里程碑提供了独特的机会。光学相干断层扫描（OCT）是眼科中最常见的成像模式，并且当与来自EMR的标记组合时表现出密集且丰富的数据集。我们试图确定是否可以使用深度学习来区分正常的OCT图像与年龄相关性黄斑变性（AMD）患者的图像。方法：自动提取OCT成像数据库，并将其与EMR的临床终点相关联。 OCT黄斑扫描由Heidelberg Spectralis获得，每个OCT扫描与从EPIC提取的EMR临床终点相关联。从两个队列的患者的正常和AMD的每个OCT扫描中选择中心的11个图像。交叉验证是使用随机的一组患者进行的。受试者操作曲线（auROC）下的面积是在独立的图像水平，黄斑OCT水平和患者水平上构建的。结果：在从EMR临床数据点提取的260万个OCT图像中，选择52,690个正常和48,312个AMD黄斑OCT图像。训练了深度神经网络，将图像归类为正常或AMD。在图像层面，我们实现了92.78％的auROC，准确率为87.63％。在黄斑层面，我们获得了93.83％的auROC，准确率为88.98％。在患者水平，我们实现了97.45％的auROC，准确率为93.45％。峰值灵敏度和特异度分别为92.64％和93.69％。结论：深度学习技术对OCT图像分类是有效的。这些发现对利用OCT进行自动筛查和计算机辅助诊断工具具有重要意义。
