##### Abstract
We present an approach to match partially occluded plant leaves with databases of full plant leaves. Although contour based 2D shape matching has been studied extensively in the last couple of decades, matching occluded leaves with full leaf databases is an open and little worked on problem. Classifying occluded plant leaves is even more challenging than full leaf matching because of large variations and complexity of leaf structures. Matching an occluded contour with all the full contours in a database is an NP-hard problem [Su et al. ICCV2015], so our algorithm is necessarily suboptimal.

我们提出了一种方法来匹配部分闭塞的植物叶子与全植物叶子的数据库。虽然基于轮廓的二维形状匹配已经在过去几十年中被广泛研究，但匹配被遮挡的叶子和全叶子数据库是一个开放的，很少的问题。由于叶子结构的变化和复杂性较大，因此将封闭的植物叶子分类比全叶子匹配更具挑战性。在一个数据库中匹配一个被遮挡的轮廓和所有的轮廓是一个NP难题[Su et al。 ICCV2015]，所以我们的算法必然是不理想的。
