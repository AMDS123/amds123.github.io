##### Abstract
Those who design, use, and are otherwise affected by advanced, technologies like artificially intelligent, autonomous systems want to know that these systems will perform correctly, understand the reasons behind their actions, and know how to use them appropriately. In short: they want to be able to trust such systems. Consequently, designers have devised various kinds of assurances for assessing trust. Typically, however, these assessments are ad hoc, and have not been formally related to each other or to formal trust models. This paper presents a survey of algorithmic assurances that allow users to calibrate their trust in autonomous artificially intelligent agents and use such autonomous agents more appropriately. To this end algorithmic assurances are first formally defined, and classified, from the perspective of formally modeled trust relationships. The survey is then performed using research from related communities such as machine learning, human-computer interaction, human-robot interaction, e-commerce, and others. The literature for different classes of assurances are identified with seven different levels of integration for artificially intelligent agents; these classes are useful for practitioners and system designers. Recommendations and directions for future work are also presented.

##### Abstract (translated by Google)
那些设计，使用并受到人工智能，自治系统等先进技术影响的人希望知道这些系统能够正确运行，了解其行为背后的原因，并知道如何恰当地使用它们。简而言之：他们希望能够信任这样的系统。因此，设计师为评估信任设计了各种保证。然而，通常情况下，这些评估是临时的，并且彼此之间或正式信任模型之间尚未正式相关。本文介绍了一种算法保证调查，该调查允许用户校准他们对自主人工智能代理的信任，并更适当地使用这些自治代理。为此，算法保证首先从正式建模的信任关系的角度进行正式定义和分类。然后使用相关社区的研究进行调查，例如机器学习，人机交互，人机交互，电子商务等。针对人工智能代理人的七种不同的整合水平确定了不同类别保证的文献;这些类对于从业者和系统设计者很有用。还介绍了未来工作的建议和方向。
