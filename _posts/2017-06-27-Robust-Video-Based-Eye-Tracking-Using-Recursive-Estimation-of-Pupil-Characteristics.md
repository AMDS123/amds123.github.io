##### Abstract
Video-based eye tracking is a valuable technique in various research fields. Numerous open-source eye tracking algorithms have been developed in recent years, primarily designed for general application with many different camera types. These algorithms do not, however, capitalize on the high frame rate of eye tracking cameras often employed in psychophysical studies. We present a pupil detection method that utilizes this high-speed property to obtain reliable predictions through recursive estimation about certain pupil characteristics in successive camera frames. These predictions are subsequently used to carry out novel image segmentation and classification routines to improve pupil detection performance. Based on results from hand-labelled eye images, our approach was found to have a greater detection rate, accuracy and speed compared to other recently published open-source pupil detection algorithms. The program's source code, together with a graphical user interface, can be downloaded at this https URL

基于视频的眼动追踪在各个研究领域中是一种有价值的技术。近年来开发了许多开源眼动追踪算法，这些算法主要是针对具有许多不同相机类型的通用应用而设计的。然而，这些算法不利用心理物理学研究中经常使用的眼动跟踪相机的高帧率。我们提出了一种利用这种高速属性的瞳孔检测方法，通过对连续相机帧中的某些瞳孔特征的递归估计来获得可靠的预测。随后使用这些预测来执行新颖的图像分割和分类例程以提高瞳孔检测性能。基于手动标记的眼睛图像的结果，我们的方法被发现比其他最近公布的开源瞳孔检测算法具有更高的检测率，准确性和速度。该程序的源代码以及图形用户界面可以在此https URL下载
