##### Abstract
Paraphrase plagiarism is one of the difficult challenges facing plagiarism detection systems. Paraphrasing occur when texts are lexically or syntactically altered to look different, but retain their original meaning. Most plagiarism detection systems (many of which are commercial based) are designed to detect word co-occurrences and light modifications, but are unable to detect severe semantic and structural alterations such as what is seen in many academic documents. Hence many paraphrase plagiarism cases go undetected. In this paper, we approached the problem of paraphrase plagiarism by proposing methods for detecting the most common techniques (phenomena) used in paraphrasing texts (namely; lexical substitution, insertion/deletion and word and phrase reordering), and combined the methods into a paraphrase detection model. We evaluated our proposed methods and model on collections containing paraphrase texts. Experimental results show significant improvement in performance when the methods were combined (the proposed model) as opposed to running them individually. The results also show that the proposed paraphrase detection model outperformed a standard baseline (based on greedy string tilling), and previous studies.

##### Abstract (translated by Google)
释义抄袭是抄袭检测系统面临的一个难题。当文本在词汇上或语法上改变为看起来不同，但保留其原来的含义时，则发生解释。大多数剽窃检测系统（其中许多是基于商业的）被设计用来检测单词共现和轻微修改，但是不能检测到严重的语义和结构改变，例如在许多学术文献中看到的。因此，许多释义抄袭案件不被发现。在本文中，我们通过提出检测文本重述（即：词汇替换，插入/删除和单词和短语重新排序）中常用的技术（现象）的方法来解决抄袭剽窃问题，并将这些方法合并为一个释义检测模型。我们评估了我们提出的含有释义文本集合的方法和模型。实验结果表明，当组合方法（所提出的模型）时，性能显着提高，而不是单独运行。结果还表明，所提出的释义检测模型优于标准基线（基于贪婪的字符串耕耘）和以前的研究。
