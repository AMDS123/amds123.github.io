##### Abstract
In recent years, deep learning has made tremendous progress in a number of fields that were previously out of reach for artificial intelligence. The successes in these problems has led researchers to consider the possibilities for intelligent systems to tackle a problem that humans have only recently themselves considered: program synthesis. This challenge is unlike others such as object recognition and speech translation, since its abstract nature and demand for rigor make it difficult even for human minds to attempt. While it is still far from being solved or even competitive with most existing methods, neural program synthesis is a rapidly growing discipline which holds great promise if completely realized. In this paper, we start with exploring the problem statement and challenges of program synthesis. Then, we examine the fascinating evolution of program induction models, along with how they have succeeded, failed and been reimagined since. Finally, we conclude with a contrastive look at program synthesis and future research recommendations for the field.

##### Abstract (translated by Google)
近年来，深度学习在人工智能以前遥不可及的领域取得了巨大的进步。这些问题的成功导致研究人员考虑到智能系统解决人类最近才考虑的问题的可能性：程序综合。这个挑战与对象识别和言语翻译等其他问题不同，因为它的抽象性和对严谨性的要求使得即使对于人类思维也是难以企图的。虽然离大多数现有的方法还有很远的距离，但是如果完全实现的话，神经程序综合是一个快速发展的学科。在本文中，我们从探索程序综合的问题陈述和挑战开始。然后，我们研究程序诱导模型的迷人进化，以及它们如何成功，失败并从此重新构想。最后，我们以对比的方式总结该领域的计划综合和未来的研究建议。
