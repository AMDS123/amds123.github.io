##### Abstract
Various methods to automate traffic data collection have recently been developed by many researchers. A macroscopic data collection through image processing has been proposed. For microscopic traffic flow data, such as individual speed and time or distance headway, tracking of individual movement is needed. The tracking algorithms for pedestrian or vehicle have been developed to trace the movement of one or two pedestrians based on sign pattern, and feature detection. No research has been done to track many pedestrians or vehicles at once. This paper describes a new and fast algorithm to track the movement of many individual vehicles or pedestrians

许多研究人员最近已经开发了各种使交通数据收集自动化的方法。已经提出了通过图像处理的宏观数据收集。对于微观交通流量数据，例如单独的速度和时间或车头距离，需要跟踪个体运动。已经开发了行人或车辆的跟踪算法，以追踪一个或两个行人基于符号模式的运动和特征检测。没有研究过一次跟踪许多行人或车辆。本文介绍了一种新的快速算法来跟踪许多个人车辆或行人的移动
