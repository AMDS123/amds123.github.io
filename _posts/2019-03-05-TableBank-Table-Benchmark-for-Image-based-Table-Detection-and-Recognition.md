##### Abstract
We present TableBank, a new image-based table detection and recognition dataset built with novel weak supervision from Word and Latex documents on the internet. Existing research for image-based table detection and recognition usually fine-tunes pre-trained models on out-of-domain data with a few thousands human labeled examples, which is difficult to generalize on real world applications. With TableBank that contains 417K high-quality labeled tables, we build several strong baselines using state-of-the-art models with deep neural networks. We make TableBank publicly available (this https URL) and hope it will empower more deep learning approaches in the table detection and recognition task.
