##### Abstract
This paper deals with the Compressive Sensing implementation in the Face Recognition problem. Compressive Sensing is new approach in signal processing with a single goal to recover signal from small set of available samples. Compressive Sensing finds its usage in many real applications as it lowers the memory demand and acquisition time, and therefore allows dealing with huge data in the fastest manner. In this paper, the undersampled signal is recovered using the algorithm based on Total Variation minimization. The theory is verified with an experimental results using different percentage of signal samples.
