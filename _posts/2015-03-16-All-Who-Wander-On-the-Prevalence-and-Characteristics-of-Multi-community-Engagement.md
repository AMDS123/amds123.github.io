##### Abstract
Although analyzing user behavior within individual communities is an active and rich research domain, people usually interact with multiple communities both on- and off-line. How do users act in such multi-community environments? Although there are a host of intriguing aspects to this question, it has received much less attention in the research community in comparison to the intra-community case. In this paper, we examine three aspects of multi-community engagement: the sequence of communities that users post to, the language that users employ in those communities, and the feedback that users receive, using longitudinal posting behavior on Reddit as our main data source, and DBLP for auxiliary experiments. We also demonstrate the effectiveness of features drawn from these aspects in predicting users' future level of activity. One might expect that a user's trajectory mimics the "settling-down" process in real life: an initial exploration of sub-communities before settling down into a few niches. However, we find that the users in our data continually post in new communities; moreover, as time goes on, they post increasingly evenly among a more diverse set of smaller communities. Interestingly, it seems that users that eventually leave the community are "destined" to do so from the very beginning, in the sense of showing significantly different "wandering" patterns very early on in their trajectories; this finding has potentially important design implications for community maintainers. Our multi-community perspective also allows us to investigate the "situation vs. personality" debate from language usage across different communities.

虽然分析个体社区内的用户行为是一个积极而丰富的研究领域，但是人们通常在线和离线与多个社区进行交互。用户如何在这种多社区环境中行动？尽管这个问题有许多有趣的方面，但与社区内案例相比，它在研究界受到的关注却少得多。在本文中，我们研究了多社区参与的三个方面：用户发布的社区序列，用户在这些社区中使用的语言以及用户收到的反馈，使用Reddit上的纵向发布行为作为我们的主要数据源和DBLP进行辅助实验。我们还展示了从这些方面预测用户未来活动水平的功能的有效性。人们可能会期望用户的轨迹模仿现实生活中的“安定”过程：在定位到少数几个小生境之前，对子社区进行初步探索。但是，我们发现，我们的数据中的用户不断地在新的社区中发布;此外，随着时间的推移，他们越来越平均地在一个更为多元化的小社区之间发帖。有趣的是，似乎最终离开社区的用户从一开始就“注定”要这样做，就是说在他们的轨迹上很早就表现出显着不同的“游走”模式;这一发现对于社区维护人员具有潜在的重要设计意义。我们的多社区视角也使我们能够调查不同社区语言使用情况下的“情况与人格”争论。
