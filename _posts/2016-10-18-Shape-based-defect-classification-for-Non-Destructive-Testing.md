##### Abstract
The aim of this work is to classify the aerospace structure defects detected by eddy current non-destructive testing. The proposed method is based on the assumption that the defect is bound to the reaction of the probe coil impedance during the test. Impedance plane analysis is used to extract a feature vector from the shape of the coil impedance in the complex plane, through the use of some geometric parameters. Shape recognition is tested with three different machine-learning based classifiers: decision trees, neural networks and Naive Bayes. The performance of the proposed detection system are measured in terms of accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, precision and Matthews correlation coefficient. Several experiments are performed on dataset of eddy current signal samples for aircraft structures. The obtained results demonstrate the usefulness of our approach and the competiveness against existing descriptors.

这项工作的目的是分类涡流无损检测发现的航空航天结构缺陷。所提出的方法是基于这样的假设，即在测试过程中缺陷与探针线圈阻抗的反应相关联。阻抗平面分析用于通过使用一些几何参数从复平面中线圈阻抗的形状中提取特征向量。形状识别通过三种不同的基于机器学习的分类器进行测试：决策树，神经网络和朴素贝叶斯。所提出的检测系统的性能是从准确性，灵敏度，特异性，精确度和马修斯相关系数来衡量的。对飞机结构的涡流信号样本数据集进行了几个实验。获得的结果表明我们的方法的有用性和对现有描述符的竞争力。
