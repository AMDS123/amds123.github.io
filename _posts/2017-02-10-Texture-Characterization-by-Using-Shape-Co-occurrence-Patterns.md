##### Abstract
Texture characterization is a key problem in image understanding and pattern recognition. In this paper, we present a flexible shape-based texture representation using shape co-occurrence patterns. More precisely, texture images are first represented by tree of shapes, each of which is associated with several geometrical and radiometric attributes. Then four typical kinds of shape co-occurrence patterns based on the hierarchical relationship of the shapes in the tree are learned as codewords. Three different coding methods are investigated to learn the codewords, with which, any given texture image can be encoded into a descriptive vector. In contrast with existing works, the proposed method not only inherits the strong ability to depict geometrical aspects of textures and the high robustness to variations of imaging conditions from the shape-based method, but also provides a flexible way to consider shape relationships and to compute high-order statistics on the tree. To our knowledge, this is the first time to use co-occurrence patterns of explicit shapes as a tool for texture analysis. Experiments on various texture datasets and scene datasets demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed method.

纹理表征是图像理解和模式识别中的关键问题。在本文中，我们提出了一种使用形状共现模式的灵活的基于形状的纹理表示。更确切地说，纹理图像首先由形状树来表示，其中每一个都与几个几何和辐射属性相关联。然后，将基于树形状的层次关系的四种典型的形状共现模式学习为码字。研究三种不同的编码方法来学习码字，其中，任何给定的纹理图像都可以被编码成一个描述向量。与现有的工作相比，本文提出的方法不仅继承了基于形状的方法强大的描述纹理几何特征和对成像条件变化的鲁棒性，而且还提供了考虑形状关系和计算的灵活方法树上的高阶统计量。就我们所知，这是第一次使用显式形状的共现模式作为纹理分析的工具。在各种纹理数据集和场景数据集上的实验证明了所提出方法的有效性。
