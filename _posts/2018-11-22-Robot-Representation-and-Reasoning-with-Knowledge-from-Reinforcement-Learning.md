##### Abstract
Reinforcement learning (RL) agents aim at learning by interacting with an environment, and are not designed for representing or reasoning with declarative knowledge. Knowledge representation and reasoning (KRR) paradigms are strong in declarative KRR tasks, but are ill-equipped to learn from such experiences. In this work, we integrate logical-probabilistic KRR with model-based RL, enabling agents to simultaneously reason with declarative knowledge and learn from interaction experiences. The knowledge from humans and RL is unified and used for dynamically computing task-specific planning models under potentially new environments. Experiments were conducted using a mobile robot working on dialog, navigation, and delivery tasks. Results show significant improvements, in comparison to existing model-based RL methods.
