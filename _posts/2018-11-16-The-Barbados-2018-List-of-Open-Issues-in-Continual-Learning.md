##### Abstract
We want to make progress toward artificial general intelligence, namely general-purpose agents that autonomously learn how to competently act in complex environments. The purpose of this report is to sketch a research outline, share some of the most important open issues we are facing, and stimulate further discussion in the community. The content is based on some of our discussions during a week-long workshop held in Barbados in February 2018.
