##### Abstract
Objective: To build a comprehensive corpus covering syntactic and semantic annotations of Chinese clinical texts with corresponding annotation guidelines and methods as well as to develop tools trained on the annotated corpus, which supplies baselines for research on Chinese texts in the clinical domain. Materials and methods: An iterative annotation method was proposed to train annotators and to develop annotation guidelines. Then, by using annotation quality assurance measures, a comprehensive corpus was built, containing annotations of part-of-speech (POS) tags, syntactic tags, entities, assertions, and relations. Inter-annotator agreement (IAA) was calculated to evaluate the annotation quality and a Chinese clinical text processing and information extraction system (CCTPIES) was developed based on our annotated corpus. Results: The syntactic corpus consists of 138 Chinese clinical documents with 47,424 tokens and 2553 full parsing trees, while the semantic corpus includes 992 documents that annotated 39,511 entities with their assertions and 7695 relations. IAA evaluation shows that this comprehensive corpus is of good quality, and the system modules are effective. Discussion: The annotated corpus makes a considerable contribution to natural language processing (NLP) research into Chinese texts in the clinical domain. However, this corpus has a number of limitations. Some additional types of clinical text should be introduced to improve corpus coverage and active learning methods should be utilized to promote annotation efficiency. Conclusions: In this study, several annotation guidelines and an annotation method for Chinese clinical texts were proposed, and a comprehensive corpus with its NLP modules were constructed, providing a foundation for further study of applying NLP techniques to Chinese texts in the clinical domain.

目的：建立涵盖中文临床文本句法和语义注释的综合语料库，并编制相应的注释准则和方法，并开发在注释语料上训练的工具，为临床领域中文文本的研究提供基线。材料和方法：提出了一种迭代的注释方法来训练注释者和制定注释准则。然后，通过使用注释质量保证措施，构建了包含词性（POS）标签，语法标签，实体，断言和关系的注释的综合语料库。计算内部注释者协议（IAA）来评估注释质量，基于我们注释的语料库开发中文临床文本处理和信息提取系统（CCTPIES）。结果：句法语料库由138个中国临床文献组成，共47424个标记和2553个全解析树，语义语料库包含992个文件，注释39511个实体，断言和7695个关系。 IAA评估表明，该综合语料质量好，系统模块有效。讨论：带注释的语料库对自然语言处理（NLP）对临床领域中文文本的研究做出了重大贡献。但是，这个语料库有一些限制。应引入一些额外的临床文本类型来提高语料库覆盖率，并利用主动学习方法来提高注释效率。结论：本研究提出了几种中医临床文本的注释方法和注释方法，构建了一个全面的具有NLP模块的语料库，为进一步研究将NLP技术应用于临床中文文本奠定了基础。
