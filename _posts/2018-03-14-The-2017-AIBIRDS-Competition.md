##### Abstract
This paper presents an overview of the sixth AIBIRDS competition, held at the 26th International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence. This competition tasked participants with developing an intelligent agent which can play the physics-based puzzle game Angry Birds. This game uses a sophisticated physics engine that requires agents to reason and predict the outcome of actions with only limited environmental information. Agents entered into this competition were required to solve a wide assortment of previously unseen levels within a set time limit. The physical reasoning and planning required to solve these levels are very similar to those of many real-world problems. This year's competition featured some of the best agents developed so far and even included several new AI techniques such as deep reinforcement learning. Within this paper we describe the framework, rules, submitted agents and results for this competition. We also provide some background information on related work and other video game AI competitions, as well as discussing some potential ideas for future AIBIRDS competitions and agent improvements.

本文概述了在第26届国际人工智能联合会议上举行的第六届AIBIRDS竞赛。这次比赛的任务是让参与者开发一个能够玩基于物理的益智游戏“愤怒的小鸟”的智能代理。这个游戏使用了一个复杂的物理引擎，它需要代理人只用有限的环境信息来推理和预测行动的结果。进入本次比赛的代理商需要在规定的时限内解决以前看不到的各种水平。解决这些问题所需的物理推理和计划与许多现实世界的问题非常相似。今年的比赛包含了迄今为止开发的一些最好的代理，甚至包括了几项新的AI技术，如深度强化学习。在本文中，我们描述了本次比赛的框架，规则，提交的代理和结果。我们还提供一些关于相关工作和其他视频游戏AI竞赛的背景信息，并讨论未来AIBIRDS竞赛和代理改进方面的一些潜在想法。
