##### Abstract
The plenoptic camera can capture both angular and spatial information of the rays, enabling 3D reconstruction by single exposure. The geometry of the recovered scene structure is affected by the calibration of the plenoptic camera significantly. In this paper, we propose a novel unconstrained two-parallel-plane (TPP) model with 7 parameters to describe a 4D light field. By reconstructing scene points from ray-ray association, a 3D projective transformation is deduced to establish the relationship between the scene structure and the TPP parameters. Based on the transformation, we simplify the focused plenoptic camera as a TPP model and calibrate its intrinsic parameters. Our calibration method includes a close-form solution and a nonlinear optimization by minimizing re-projection error. Experiments on both simulated data and real scene data verify the performance of the calibration on the focused plenoptic camera.

全光照相机可以捕获射线的角度和空间信息，通过单次曝光实现三维重建。恢复的场景结构的几何形状受到全光照相机的校准的显着影响。在本文中，我们提出了一个具有7个参数的新的无约束双平行（TPP）模型来描述四维光场。通过重建射线关联场景点，推导出三维投影变换，建立场景结构与TPP参数之间的关系。基于这种变换，我们将聚焦的全光相机简化为TPP模型，并校准其内在参数。我们的校准方法包括一个近似解和一个非线性优化，通过最小化再投影误差。模拟数据和真实场景数据的实验验证了聚焦全光照相机的校准性能。
