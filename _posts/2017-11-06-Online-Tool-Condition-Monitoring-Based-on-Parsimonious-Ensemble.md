##### Abstract
Accurate diagnosis of tool wear in metal turning process remains an open challenge for both scientists and industrial practitioners because of inhomogeneities in workpiece material, nonstationary machining settings to suit production requirements, and nonlinear relations between measured variables and tool wear. Common methodologies for tool condition monitoring still rely on batch approaches which cannot cope with a fast sampling rate of metal cutting process. Furthermore they require a retraining process to be completed from scratch when dealing with a new set of machining parameters. This paper presents an online tool condition monitoring approach based on Parsimonious Ensemble+, pENsemble+. The unique feature of pENsemble+ lies in its highly flexible principle where both ensemble structure and base-classifier structure can automatically grow and shrink on the fly based on the characteristics of data streams. Moreover, the online feature selection scenario is integrated to actively sample relevant input attributes. The paper presents advancement of a newly developed ensemble learning algorithm, pENsemble+, where online active learning scenario is incorporated to reduce operator labelling effort. The ensemble merging scenario is proposed which allows reduction of ensemble complexity while retaining its diversity. Experimental studies utilising real-world manufacturing data streams and comparisons with well known algorithms were carried out. Furthermore, the efficacy of pENsemble was examined using benchmark concept drift data streams. It has been found that pENsemble+ incurs low structural complexity and results in a significant reduction of operator labelling effort.

由于工件材料的不均匀性，适合生产要求的非平稳加工设置以及测量变量和刀具磨损之间的非线性关系，对金属车削过程中刀具磨损的准确诊断仍然是科学家和工业从业者面临的公开挑战。刀具状态监测的常用方法仍然依赖于批量方法，不能应对金属切削过程的快速采样率。此外，在处理一组新的加工参数时，他们需要重新进行再训练。本文提出了一种基于Parsimonious Ensemble +，pENsemble +的在线刀具状态监测方法。 pENsemble +的独特之处在于其高度灵活的原则，即集成结构和基本分类器结构可以根据数据流的特性自动增长和缩小。此外，在线特征选择方案被集成以主动地对相关输入属性进行采样。本文提出了一个新开发的集成学习算法pENsemble +，其中包含在线主动学习场景，以减少操作员的标签工作量。提出的集合合并方案允许在保持其多样性的同时降低集合的复杂性。利用真实世界的制造数据流进行实验研究，并与众所周知的算法进行比较。此外，使用基准概念漂移数据流检查pENsemble的功效。已经发现，pENsemble +结构复杂度低，并导致运营商标签工作的显着减少。
