##### Abstract
Person re-identification is the problem of recognizing people across different images or videos with non-overlapping views. Although there has been much progress in person re-identification over the last decade, it remains a challenging task because appearances of people can seem extremely different across diverse camera viewpoints and person poses. In this paper, we propose a novel framework for person re-identification by analyzing camera viewpoints and person poses in a so-called Pose-aware Multi-shot Matching (PaMM), which robustly estimates people's poses and efficiently conducts multi-shot matching based on pose information. Experimental results using public person re-identification datasets show that the proposed methods outperform state-of-the-art methods and are promising for person re-identification from diverse viewpoints and pose variances.

个人重新识别是在不同的图像或视频中以不重叠的视角识别人物的问题。尽管过去十年在个人身份识别方面取得了很大的进展，但仍然是一项具有挑战性的任务，因为在不同的摄像机视角和人物姿态下，人们的外表看起来会有很大的不同。在本文中，我们提出了一个新的人脸识别框架，通过分析摄像机的观点和人的姿势在一个所谓的姿态感知多次匹配（PaMM），强大估计人的姿势，有效地进行基于多重匹配在姿势信息。使用公众人物重新识别数据集的实验结果表明，所提出的方法胜过最先进的方法，并且有希望从不同的角度重新进行人物识别并造成差异。
