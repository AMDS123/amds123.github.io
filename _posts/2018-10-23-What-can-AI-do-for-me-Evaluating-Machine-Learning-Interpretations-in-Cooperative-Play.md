##### Abstract
Machine learning is an important tool for decision making, but its ethical and responsible application requires rigorous vetting of its interpretability and utility: an understudied problem, particularly for natural language processing models. We design a task-specific evaluation for a question answering task and evaluate how well a model interpretation improves human performance in a human-machine cooperative setting. We evaluate interpretation methods in a grounded, realistic setting: playing a trivia game as a team. We also provide design guidance for natural language processing human-in-the-loop settings.
