##### Abstract
Image segmentation has many applications which range from machine learning to medical diagnosis. In this paper, we propose a framework for the segmentation of images based on super-pixels and algorithms for community identification in graphs. The super-pixel pre-segmentation step reduces the number of nodes in the graph, rendering the method the ability to process large images. Moreover, community detection algorithms provide more accurate segmentation than traditional approaches, such as those based on spectral graph partition. We also compare our method with two algorithms: a) the graph-based approach by Felzenszwalb and Huttenlocher and b) the contour-based method by Arbelaez. Results have shown that our method provides more precise segmentation and is faster than both of them.

图像分割有许多应用，从机器学习到医学诊断。在本文中，我们提出了一个基于超像素的图像分割框架和图的社区识别算法。超像素预分割步骤减少了图中节点的数量，使该方法能够处理大图像。而且，社区检测算法比传统方法（如基于谱图分割的方法）提供更精确的分割。我们还将我们的方法与两种算法进行了比较：a）Felzenszwalb和Huttenlocher的基于图的方法和b）Arbelaez的基于轮廓的方法。结果表明，我们的方法提供了更精确的分割，并且比两者都快。
