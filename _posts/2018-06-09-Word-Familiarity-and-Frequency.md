##### Abstract
Word frequency is assumed to correlate with word familiarity, but the strength of this correlation has not been thoroughly investigated. In this paper, we report on our analysis of the correlation between a word familiarity rating list obtained through a psycholinguistic experiment and the log-frequency obtained from various corpora of different kinds and sizes (up to the terabyte scale) for English and Japanese. Major findings are threefold: First, for a given corpus, familiarity is necessary for a word to achieve high frequency, but familiar words are not necessarily frequent. Second, correlation increases with the corpus data size. Third, a corpus of spoken language correlates better than one of written language. These findings suggest that cognitive familiarity ratings are correlated to frequency, but more highly to that of spoken rather than written language.

##### Abstract (translated by Google)
假设词频与词熟悉度相关，但这种相关性的强度尚未被彻底调查。在本文中，我们报告了我们对通过心理语言学实验获得的词熟悉评定列表与从英语和日语的各种不同大小（高达TB级）的各种语料库获得的对数频率之间的相关性的分析。主要研究结果有三个：首先，对于给定的语料库，熟悉性对于一个词来说是必要的，以达到高频率，但熟悉的词不一定是频繁的。其次，相关性随着语料库数据的大小而增加。第三，口语语料比书面语言更好。这些研究结果表明，认知熟悉度评分与频率相关，但对口语而非书面语言更为重要。
