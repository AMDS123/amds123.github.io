##### Abstract
We propose a recurrent neural network classifier to detect pathologies in 12-lead ECG signals and train and validate the classifier with the Chinese physiological signal challenge dataset (this http URL). The recurrent neural network consists of two bi-directional LSTM layers and can train on arbitrary-length ECG signals. Our best trained model achieved an average F1 score of 74.15% on the validation set. Keywords: ECG classification, Deep learning, RNN, Bi-directional LSTM, QRS detection.
