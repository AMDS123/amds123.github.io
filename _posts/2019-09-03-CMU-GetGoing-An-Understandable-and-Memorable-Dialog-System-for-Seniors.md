##### Abstract
Voice-based technologies are typically developed for the average user, and thus generally not tailored to the specific needs of any subgroup of the population, like seniors. This paper presents CMU GetGoing, an accessible trip planning dialog system designed for senior users. The GetGoing system design is described in detail, with particular attention to the senior-tailored features. A user study is presented, demonstrating that the senior-tailored features significantly improve comprehension and retention of information.
