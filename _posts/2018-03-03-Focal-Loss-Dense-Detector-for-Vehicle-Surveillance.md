##### Abstract
Deep learning has been widely recognized as a promising approach in different computer vision applications. Specifically, one-stage object detector and two-stage object detector are regarded as the most important two groups of Convolutional Neural Network based object detection methods. One-stage object detector could usually outperform two-stage object detector in speed; However, it normally trails in detection accuracy, compared with two-stage object detectors. In this study, focal loss based RetinaNet, which works as one-stage object detector, is utilized to be able to well match the speed of regular one-stage detectors and also defeat two-stage detectors in accuracy, for vehicle detection. State-of-the-art performance result has been showed on the DETRAC vehicle dataset.

##### Abstract (translated by Google)
深度学习在不同的计算机视觉应用中被广泛认为是一种有前途的方法。具体来说，一阶段目标检测器和两阶段目标检测器被认为是最重要的两组基于卷积神经网络的目标检测方法。一级物体探测器在速度上通常优于两级物体探测器;然而，与两级物体检测器相比，它通常在检测精度方面落后。在这项研究中，基于焦点损失的RetinaNet作为单级物体探测器，可以很好地匹配常规一级探测器的速度，并且还可以在精度上击败两级探测器，以用于车辆探测。最先进的性能结果已经在DETRAC车辆数据集上显示出来。
