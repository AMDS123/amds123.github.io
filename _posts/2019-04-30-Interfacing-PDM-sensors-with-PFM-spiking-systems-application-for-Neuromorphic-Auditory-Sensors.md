##### Abstract
In this paper we present a sub-system to convert audio information from low-power MEMS microphones with pulse density modulation (PDM) output into rate coded spike streams. These spikes represent the input signal of a Neuromorphic Auditory Sensor (NAS), which is implemented with Spike Signal Processing (SSP) building blocks. For this conversion, we have designed a HDL component for FPGA able to interface with PDM microphones and converts their pulses to temporal distributed spikes following a pulse frequency modulation (PFM) scheme with an accurate configurable Inter-Spike-Interval. The new FPGA component has been tested in two scenarios, first as a stand-alone circuit for its characterization, and then it has been integrated with a full NAS design to verify its behavior. This PDM interface demands less than 1% of a Spartan 6 FPGA resources and has a power consumption below 5mW.
