##### Abstract
Identifying user's identity is a key problem in many data mining applications, such as product recommendation, customized content delivery and criminal identification. Given a set of accounts from the same or different social network platforms, user identification attempts to identify all accounts belonging to the same person. A commonly used solution is to build the relationship among different accounts by exploring their collective patterns, e.g., user profile, writing style, similar comments. However, this kind of method doesn't work well in many practical scenarios, since the information posted explicitly by users may be false due to various reasons. In this paper, we re-inspect the user identification problem from a novel perspective, i.e., identifying user's identity by matching his/her cameras. The underlying assumption is that multiple accounts belonging to the same person contain the same or similar camera fingerprint information. The proposed framework, called User Camera Identification (UCI), is based on camera fingerprints, which takes fully into account the problems of multiple cameras and reposting behaviors.

识别用户身份是许多数据挖掘应用中的关键问题，如产品推荐，定制内容交付和犯罪识别。给定来自相同或不同社交网络平台的一组帐户，用户识别尝试识别属于同一个人的所有帐户。一个常用的解决方案是通过探索他们的集体模式，例如用户简介，写作风格，类似的评论来建立不同账户之间的关系。然而，这种方法在很多实际情况下并不能很好地工作，因为由于各种原因用户明确发布的信息可能是错误的。在本文中，我们从新的角度重新检查用户识别问题，即通过匹配他/她的相机来识别用户的身份。基本假设是属于同一个人的多个账户包含相同或相似的相机指纹信息。所提出的称为用户相机识别（User Camera Identification，UCI）的框架基于相机指纹，其充分考虑了多个相机和转发行为的问题。
