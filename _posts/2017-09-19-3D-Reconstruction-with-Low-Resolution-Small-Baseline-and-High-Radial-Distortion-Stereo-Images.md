##### Abstract
In this paper we analyze and compare approaches for 3D reconstruction from low-resolution (250x250), high radial distortion stereo images, which are acquired with small baseline (approximately 1mm). These images are acquired with the system NanEye Stereo manufactured by CMOSIS/AWAIBA. These stereo cameras have also small apertures, which means that high levels of illumination are required. The goal was to develop an approach yielding accurate reconstructions, with a low computational cost, i.e., avoiding non-linear numerical optimization algorithms. In particular we focused on the analysis and comparison of radial distortion models. To perform the analysis and comparison, we defined a baseline method based on available software and methods, such as the Bouguet toolbox [2] or the Computer Vision Toolbox from Matlab. The approaches tested were based on the use of the polynomial model of radial distortion, and on the application of the division model. The issue of the center of distortion was also addressed within the framework of the application of the division model. We concluded that the division model with a single radial distortion parameter has limitations.

在本文中，我们分析和比较从低分辨率（250x250），高径向失真的立体图像，用小基线（约1毫米）获得三维重建的方法。这些图像是由CMOSIS / AWAIBA制造的NanEye Stereo系统获得的。这些立体相机也有小光圈，这意味着需要高水平的照明。目标是开发一种产生准确重建的方法，具有低计算成本，即避免非线性数值优化算法。我们特别关注径向畸变模型的分析和比较。为了进行分析和比较，我们定义了基于可用软件和方法的基线方法，如Bouguet工具箱[2]或Matlab的计算机视觉工具箱。所测试的方法是基于使用径向失真的多项式模型以及分割模型的应用。在分工模式的应用框架内也解决了扭曲的中心问题。我们得出的结论是，具有单个径向失真参数的分割模型具有局限性。
