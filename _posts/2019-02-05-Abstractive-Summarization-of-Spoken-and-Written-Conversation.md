##### Abstract
Nowadays, lots of information is available in form of dialogues. We propose a novel abstractive summarization system for conversations. We use sequence tagging of utterances for identifying the discourse relations of the dialogue. After aptly capturing these relations in a paragraph, we feed it into an Attention-based pointer network to produce abstractive summaries. We obtain ROUGE-1, 2 F-scores similar to those of extractive summaries of various previous works.
