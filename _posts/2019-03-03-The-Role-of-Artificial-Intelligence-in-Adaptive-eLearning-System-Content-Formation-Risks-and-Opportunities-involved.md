##### Abstract
Artificial Intelligence (AI) plays varying roles in supporting both existing and emerging technologies. In the area of Learning and Tutoring, it plays key role in Intelligent Tutoring Systems (ITS). The fusion of ITS with Adaptive Hypermedia and Multimedia (AHAM) form the backbone of Adaptive eLearning Systems (AES) which provides personalized experiences to learners. This experience is important because it facilitates the accurate delivery of the learning modules in specific to the learner capacity and readiness. AES types vary, with Adaptive Web Based eLearning Systems (AWBES) being the popular type because of wider access offered by the web technology.The retrieval and aggregation of contents for any eLearning system is critical whichis determined by the relevance of learning material to the needs of the learner.In this paper, we discuss components of AES, role of AI in AES content aggregation, possible risks and available opportunities.
