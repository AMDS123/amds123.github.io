##### Abstract
Ceramic tiles have become very popular and are used in the flooring of offices and shopping malls. As testing the quality of tiles manually in a highly polluted environment in the manufacturing industry is a labor-intensive and time consuming process, analysis is carried out on the tile images. This paper discusses an automated system to detect the defects on the surface of ceramic tiles based on dilation, erosion, SMEE and boundary detection techniques.
