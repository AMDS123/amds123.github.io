##### Abstract
Hypernym discovery is the problem of finding terms that have is-a relationship with a given term. We introduce a new context type, and a relatedness measure to differentiate hypernyms from other types of semantic relationships. Our Document Structure measure is based on hierarchical position of terms in a document, and their presence or otherwise in definition text. This measure quantifies the document structure using multiple attributes, and classes of weighted distance functions.
