##### Abstract
Verbal metonymy has received relatively scarce attention in the field of computational linguistics despite the fact that a model to accurately paraphrase metonymy has applications both in academia and the technology sector. The method described in this paper makes use of data from the British National Corpus in order to create word vectors, find instances of verbal metonymy and generate potential paraphrases. Two different ways of creating word vectors are evaluated in this study: Continuous bag of words and Skip-grams. Skip-grams are found to outperform the Continuous bag of words approach. Furthermore, the Skip-gram model is found to operate with better-than-chance accuracy and there is a strong positive relationship (phi coefficient = 0.61) between the model's classification and human judgement of the ranked paraphrases. This study lends credence to the viability of modelling verbal metonymy through computational methods based on distributional semantics.

口头转喻在计算语言学领域受到的关注比较少，尽管一个准确的转喻转喻模型在学术界和技术领域都有应用。本文所述的方法利用英国国家语料库的数据来创建词汇向量，找到口头转喻的实例并产生潜在的释义。在这项研究中评估了两种不同的创建单词向量的方法：连续的单词和跳跃克。跳过克被发现表现超越连续袋字的方法。此外，Skip-gram模型的运行准确性较好，模型的分类与人类判断之间存在较强的正相关关系（phi系数= 0.61）。本研究借鉴基于分布式语义的计算方法，借鉴了口头转喻建模的可行性。
