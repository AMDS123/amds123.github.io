##### Abstract
Data collection and annotation are time-consuming in machine learning, expecially for large scale problem. A common approach for this problem is to transfer knowledge from a related labeled domain to a target one. There are two popular ways to achieve this goal: adversarial learning and self training. In this article, we first analyze the training unstablity problem and the mistaken confusion issue in adversarial learning process. Then, inspired by domain confusion and self-ensembling methods, we propose a combined model to learn feature and class jointly invariant representation, namely Domain Confusion with Self Ensembling (DCSE). The experiments verified that our proposed approach can offer better performance than empirical art in a variety of unsupervised domain adaptation benchmarks.
