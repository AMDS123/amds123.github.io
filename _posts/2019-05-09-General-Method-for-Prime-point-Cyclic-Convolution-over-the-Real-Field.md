##### Abstract
A general and fast method is conceived for computing the cyclic convolution of n points, where n is a prime number. This method fully exploits the internal structure of the cyclic matrix, and hence leads to significant reduction of the multiplication complexity in terms of CPU time by 50%, as compared with Winograd's algorithm. In this paper, we only consider the real and complex fields due to their most important applications, but in general, the idea behind this method can be extended to any finite field of interest. Clearly, it is well-known that the discrete Fourier transform (DFT) can be expressed in terms of cyclic convolution, so it can be utilized to compute the DFT when the block length is a prime.
