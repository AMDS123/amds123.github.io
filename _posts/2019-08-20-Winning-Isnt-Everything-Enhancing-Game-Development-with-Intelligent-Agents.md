##### Abstract
Recently, there have been several high-profile achievements of agents learning to play games against humans and beat them. In this paper, we study the problem of training intelligent agents in service of game development. Unlike the agents built to "beat the game", our agents aim to produce human-like behavior to help with game evaluation and balancing. We discuss two fundamental metrics based on which we measure the human-likeness of agents, namely skill and style, which are multi-faceted concepts with practical implications outlined in this paper. We discuss how this framework applies to multiple games under development at Electronic Arts, followed by some of the lessons learned.
