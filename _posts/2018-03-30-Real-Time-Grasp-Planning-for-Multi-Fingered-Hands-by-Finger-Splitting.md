##### Abstract
Grasp planning for multi-fingered hands is computationally expensive due to the joint-contact coupling, surface nonlinearities and high dimensionality, thus is generally not affordable for real-time implementations. Traditional planning methods by optimization, sampling or learning work well in planning for parallel grippers but remain challenging for multi-fingered hands. This paper proposes a strategy called finger splitting, to plan grasps for multi-fingered hands starting from optimal parallel grasps. The finger splitting is optimized by a dual-stage iterative optimization including a contact point optimization (CPO) and a palm pose optimization (PPO), to gradually split fingers and adjust both the contact points and the palm pose. The dual-stage optimization is able to consider both the object grasp quality and hand manipulability, address the nonlinearities and coupling, and achieve efficient convergence within one second. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

由于联合接触耦合，表面非线性和高维度，对多指手的抓取计划在计算上是昂贵的，因此通常对于实时实现而言不可承受。通过优化，采样或学习的传统计划方法可以很好地规划并行气爪，但对于多指手来说仍然具有挑战性。本文提出了一种称为手指分裂的策略，用于从最佳平行抓握开始计划多指手的抓握。手指分裂通过包括接触点优化（CPO）和手掌姿态优化（PPO）的双级迭代优化来优化，以逐渐分开手指并调整接触点和手掌姿势。双级优化能够同时考虑对象抓取质量和手的可操作性，解决非线性和耦合问题，并在一秒内实现高效收敛。仿真结果证明了该方法的有效性。
