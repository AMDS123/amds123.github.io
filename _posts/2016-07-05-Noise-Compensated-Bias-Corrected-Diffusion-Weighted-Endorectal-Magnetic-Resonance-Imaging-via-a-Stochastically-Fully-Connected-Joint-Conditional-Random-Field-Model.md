##### Abstract
Diffusion weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DW-MR) is a powerful tool in imaging-based prostate cancer screening and detection. Endorectal coils are commonly used in DW-MR imaging to improve the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the acquisition, at the expense of significant intensity inhomogeneities (bias field) that worsens as we move away from the endorectal coil. The presence of bias field can have a significant negative impact on the accuracy of different image analysis tasks, as well as prostate tumor localization, thus leading to increased inter- and intra-observer variability. Retrospective bias correction approaches are introduced as a more efficient way of bias correction compared to the prospective methods such that they correct for both of the scanner and anatomy-related bias fields in MR imaging. Previously proposed retrospective bias field correction methods suffer from undesired noise amplification that can reduce the quality of bias-corrected DW-MR image. Here, we propose a unified data reconstruction approach that enables joint compensation of bias field as well as data noise in DW-MR imaging. The proposed noise-compensated, bias-corrected (NCBC) data reconstruction method takes advantage of a novel stochastically fully connected joint conditional random field (SFC-JCRF) model to mitigate the effects of data noise and bias field in the reconstructed MR data. The proposed NCBC reconstruction method was tested on synthetic DW-MR data, physical DW-phantom as well as real DW-MR data all acquired using endorectal MR coil. Both qualitative and quantitative analysis illustrated that the proposed NCBC method can achieve improved image quality when compared to other tested bias correction methods. As such, the proposed NCBC method may have potential as a useful retrospective approach for improving the consistency of image interpretations.

扩散加权磁共振成像（DW-MR）是基于成像的前列腺癌筛查和检测的有力工具。在DW-MR成像中，通常使用直肠内线圈来改善采集的信噪比（SNR），代价是随着远离直肠内线圈而显着强度不均匀性（偏置场）变差。偏置场的存在会对不同的图像分析任务以及前列腺肿瘤定位的准确性产生显着的负面影响，从而导致观察者间和观察者间的差异性增加。引入回溯性偏倚矫正方法作为偏倚矫正的一种更有效的方式，与前瞻性方法相比，它们可以校正MR成像中的扫描仪和解剖相关偏倚场。以前提出的回顾性偏置场校正方法受到不希望的噪声放大的影响，这会降低偏置校正的DW-MR图像的质量。在这里，我们提出了一个统一的数据重建方法，能够联合补偿偏置场以及DW-MR成像中的数据噪声。所提出的噪声补偿偏置校正（NCBC）数据重建方法利用新型随机全连接联合条件随机场（SFC-JCRF）模型来缓解重建MR数据中的数据噪声和偏置场的影响。所提出的NCBC重建方法在合成DW-MR数据，物理DW-phantom以及真实的DW-MR数据上进行了测试，所有数据均采用直肠内MR线圈。定性和定量分析都表明，与其他测试偏差校正方法相比，所提出的NCBC方法可以实现改善的图像质量。因此，提出的NCBC方法可能有潜力作为一种有用的追溯方法来提高图像解释的一致性。
