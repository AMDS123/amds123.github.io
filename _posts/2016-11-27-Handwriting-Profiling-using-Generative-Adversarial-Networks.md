##### Abstract
Handwriting is a skill learned by humans from a very early age. The ability to develop one's own unique handwriting as well as mimic another person's handwriting is a task learned by the brain with practice. This paper deals with this very problem where an intelligent system tries to learn the handwriting of an entity using Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). We propose a modified architecture of DCGAN (Radford, Metz, and Chintala 2015) to achieve this. We also discuss about applying reinforcement learning techniques to achieve faster learning. Our algorithm hopes to give new insights in this area and its uses include identification of forged documents, signature verification, computer generated art, digitization of documents among others. Our early implementation of the algorithm illustrates a good performance with MNIST datasets.

手写是人类从很早就学会的技能。开发自己独特的笔迹以及模仿别人的笔迹的能力是大脑习练的任务。本文讨论了智能系统尝试使用生成敌对​​网络（GAN）来学习实体的手写的这个问题。我们提出一个改进的DCGAN体系结构（Radford，Metz和Chintala 2015）来实现这一点。我们也讨论应用强化学习技术来实现更快的学习。我们的算法希望能够在这方面提供新的见解，其用途包括伪造文件的识别，签名验证，计算机生成的艺术，文件的数字化等等。我们早期的算法实现说明了MNIST数据集的良好性能。
