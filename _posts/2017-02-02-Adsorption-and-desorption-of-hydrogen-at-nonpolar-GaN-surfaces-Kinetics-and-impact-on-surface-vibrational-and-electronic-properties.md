##### Abstract
The adsorption of hydrogen at nonpolar GaN(1-100) surfaces and its impact on the electronic and vibrational properties is investigated using surface electron spectroscopy in combination with density functional theory (DFT) calculations. For the surface mediated dissociation of H2 and the subsequent adsorption of H, an energy barrier of 0.55 eV has to be overcome. The calculated kinetic surface phase diagram indicates that the reaction is kinetically hindered at low pressures and low temperatures. At higher temperatures ab-initio thermodynamics show, that the H-free surface is energetically favored. To validate these theoretical predictions experiments at room temperature and under ultrahigh vacuum conditions were performed. They reveal that molecular hydrogen does not dissociatively adsorb at the GaN(1-100) surface. Only activated atomic hydrogen atoms attach to the surface. At temperatures above 820 K, the attached hydrogen gets desorbed. The adsorbed hydrogen atoms saturate the dangling bonds of the gallium and nitrogen surface atoms and result in an inversion of the Ga-N surface dimer buckling. The signatures of the Ga-H and N-H vibrational modes on the H-covered surface have experimentally been identified and are in good agreement with the DFT calculations of the surface phonon modes. Both theory and experiment show that H adsorption results in a removal of occupied and unoccupied intragap electron states of the clean GaN(1-100) surface and a reduction of the surface upward band bending by 0.4 eV. The latter mechanism largely reduces surface electron depletion.

通过结合密度泛函理论（DFT）计算，研究了非极性GaN（1-100）表面上氢的吸附及其对电子和振动性质的影响。对于H2的表面介导的解离和H的后续吸附，必须克服0.55eV的能量势垒。计算的动力学表面相图表明反应在低压和低温下动力学受阻。在较高温度下，从头算热力学表明，无氢表面在能量上是有利的。为了验证这些理论预测，在室温和超高真空条件下进行实验。他们揭示了分子氢不能分解吸附在GaN（1-100）表面。只有活化的原子氢原子附着在表面上。在820K以上的温度下，附着的氢被解吸。吸附的氢原子饱和镓和氮表面原子的悬挂键并导致Ga-N表面二聚体扭曲的反转。在H覆盖表面上的Ga-H和N-H振动模式的特征已经被实验确定，并且与表面声子模式的DFT计算很好地一致。理论和实验都表明，H吸附导致清洁的GaN（1-100）表面的被占据和未被占据的内部电子状态的去除，并且表面向上带弯曲减少了0.4eV。后者机制大大减少表面电子耗尽。
