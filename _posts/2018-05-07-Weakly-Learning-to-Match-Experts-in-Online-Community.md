##### Abstract
In online question-and-answer (QA) websites like Quora, one central issue is to find (invite) users who are able to provide answers to a given question and at the same time would be unlikely to say "no" to the invitation. The challenge is how to trade off the matching degree between users' expertise and the question topic, and the likelihood of positive response from the invited users. In this paper, we formally formulate the problem and develop a weakly supervised factor graph (WeakFG) model to address the problem. The model explicitly captures expertise matching degree between questions and users. To model the likelihood that an invited user is willing to answer a specific question, we incorporate a set of correlations based on social identity theory into the WeakFG model. We use two different genres of datasets: QA-Expert and Paper-Reviewer, to validate the proposed model. Our experimental results show that the proposed model can significantly outperform (+1.5-10.7% by MAP) the state-of-the-art algorithms for matching users (experts) with community questions. We have also developed an online system to further demonstrate the advantages of the proposed method.

在像Quora这样的在线问答（QA）网站中，一个核心问题是找到（邀请）能够提供给定问题的答案的用户，同时不可能对邀请说“不” 。面临的挑战是如何权衡用户专业知识与问题主题之间的匹配程度以及受邀用户的积极响应的可能性。在本文中，我们正式制定问题并开发弱监督因子图（WeakFG）模型来解决这个问题。该模型明确捕捉问题与用户之间的专业匹配程度。为了模拟受邀用户愿意回答特定问题的可能性，我们将基于社会身份理论的一组相关性纳入WeakFG模型。我们使用两种不同类型的数据集：QA-Expert和Paper-Reviewer来验证所提出的模型。我们的实验结果表明，该模型可以显着优于MAP（+ 1.5-10.7％）用于匹配用户（专家）和社区问题的最先进的算法。我们还开发了一个在线系统来进一步证明所提出的方法的优点。
