##### Abstract
There are moments where we make decisions involving tradeoffs among costs and benefits occurring in different times. Essentially, in these cases, we are evaluating dynamic processes with outcomes still unknown. So, do we use some intuitive logic to judge changes involving values and time? The fuzzy temporal logic, introduced in this paper, proposes to model the figures of thought necessary to form a rhetoric for decision-making. To exemplify, the intertemporal choices and the lotteries choices are analyzed. The first problem is related to the time preference of receiving amounts on different dates. So it is shown that a subadditive hyperbolic discount function is not anomaly, but it consistently describes the goods delay within the fuzzy temporal logic. The second problem is related to values and probabilities of lotteries, where Prospect Theory behaviors and the S-shaped curve can be described using tense operators and fuzzy set operators. In addition, it is shown that some behaviors are amount dependent where the fuzziness can be decisive in the judgment. Thus, time, uncertainty and fuzziness are unified in a single matter which models the rhetoric for decision-making in different contexts of gains and losses.
