##### Abstract
With the arrival of convolutional neural networks, the complex problem of food recognition has experienced an important improvement in recent years. The best results have been obtained using methods based on very deep convolutional neural networks, which show that the deeper the model,the better the classification accuracy will be obtain. However, very deep neural networks may suffer from the overfitting problem. In this paper, we propose a combination of multiple classifiers based on different convolutional models that complement each other and thus, achieve an improvement in performance. The evaluation of our approach is done on two public datasets: Food-101 as a dataset with a wide variety of fine-grained dishes, and Food-11 as a dataset of high-level food categories, where our approach outperforms the independent CNN models.

随着卷积神经网络的到来，食物识别这个复杂的问题近年来得到了重要的改善。使用基于非常深的卷积神经网络的方法已经获得了最好的结果，表明模型越深，分类精度就越好。然而，非常深的神经网络可能会遭受过度配合问题的困扰。在本文中，我们提出了基于不同卷积模型的多个分类器相互补充的组合，从而实现了性能的提高。我们的方法的评估是在两个公共数据集上完成的：Food-101作为一个数据集，包含各种细粒度的菜肴，Food-11作为高级食物类别的数据集，我们的方法胜过独立的CNN模型。
