##### Abstract
Pulmonary embolism (PE) is a highly mortal disease, currently assessed by pulmonary CT angiography. True-FISP MRI has emerged as an innocuous alternative that does not hold many of the limitations of x-ray imaging. However, True-FISP MRI is very sensitive to turbulent blood flow, generating artifacts that may resemble fake clots in the pulmonary vasculature. These misinterpretations reduce its overall diagnostic accuracy to 94%, limiting a wider use in clinical environments. A new segmentation algorithm is proposed to confirm the presence of real pulmonary clots in True-FISP MR images by quantitative means, measuring the shape, intensity, and solidity of the formation. The algorithm was evaluated in 37 patients. The developed method increased the diagnostic accuracy of expert observers assessing Pulmonary True-FISP MRI sequences by 6% without the use of ionizing radiation, achieving a diagnostic accuracy comparable to standard CT angiography.

肺栓塞（PE）是一种高度致命的疾病，目前通过肺CT血管造影评估。 True-FISP MRI作为一种无害的替代品已经出现，并不具备许多X射线成像的局限性。然而，True-FISP MRI对湍流血流非常敏感，产生的伪像可能与肺血管系统中的假凝块相似。这些误解将其总体诊断准确性降低至94％，限制了在临床环境中的更广泛使用。提出了一种新的分割算法，通过定量的方法确定True-FISP MR图像中真实肺部凝块的存在，测量地层的形状，强度和坚实度。该算法在37例患者中进行评估。所开发的方法提高了专家观察者在不使用电离辐射的情况下评估肺True-FISP MRI序列6％的诊断准确度，实现了与标准CT血管造影相当的诊断准确度。
