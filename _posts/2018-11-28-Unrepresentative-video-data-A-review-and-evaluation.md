##### Abstract
It is well known that the quality and quantity of training data are significant factors which affect the development and performance of machine intelligence algorithms. Without representative data, neither scientists nor algorithms would be able to accurately capture the visual details of objects, actions or scenes. An evaluation methodology which filters data quality does not yet exist, and currently, the validation of the data depends solely on human factor. This study reviews several public datasets and discusses their limitations and issues regarding quality, feasibility, adaptation and availability of training data. A simple approach to evaluate (i.e. automatically "clean" samples) training data is proposed with the use of real events recorded on the YouTube platform. This study focuses on action recognition data and particularly on human fall detection datasets. However, the limitations described in this paper apply in virtually all datasets.
