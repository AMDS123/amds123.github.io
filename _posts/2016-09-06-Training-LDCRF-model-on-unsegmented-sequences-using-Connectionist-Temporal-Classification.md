##### Abstract
Many machine learning problems such as speech recognition, gesture recognition, and handwriting recognition are concerned with simultaneous segmentation and labeling of sequence data. Latent-dynamic conditional random field (LDCRF) is a well-known discriminative method that has been successfully used for this task. However, LDCRF can only be trained with pre-segmented data sequences in which the label of each frame is available apriori. In the realm of neural networks, the invention of connectionist temporal classification (CTC) made it possible to train recurrent neural networks on unsegmented sequences with great success. In this paper, we use CTC to train an LDCRF model on unsegmented sequences. Experimental results on two gesture recognition tasks show that the proposed method outperforms LDCRFs, hidden Markov models, and conditional random fields.

许多机器学习问题，如语音识别，手势识别和手写识别都涉及序列数据的同时分割和标记。潜动态条件随机场（LDCRF）是一个众所周知的判别方法，已经成功地用于这个任务。但是，LDCRF只能用预先分段的数据序列进行训练，其中每个帧的标签都是先验的。在神经网络领域，连接主义时间分类（CTC）的发明使得训练非分段序列上的递归神经网络成为可能。在本文中，我们使用CTC在非分段序列上训练LDCRF模型。两个手势识别任务的实验结果表明，该方法优于LDCRF，隐马尔可夫模型和条件随机场。
