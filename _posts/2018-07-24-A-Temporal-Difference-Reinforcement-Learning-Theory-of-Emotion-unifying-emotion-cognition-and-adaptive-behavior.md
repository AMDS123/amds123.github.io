##### Abstract
Emotions are intimately tied to motivation and the adaptation of behavior, and many animal species show evidence of emotions in their behavior. Therefore, emotions must be related to powerful mechanisms that aid survival, and, emotions must be evolutionary continuous phenomena. How and why did emotions evolve in nature, how do events get emotionally appraised, how do emotions relate to cognitive complexity, and, how do they impact behavior and learning? In this article I propose that all emotions are manifestations of reward processing, in particular Temporal Difference (TD) error assessment. Reinforcement Learning (RL) is a powerful computational model for the learning of goal oriented tasks by exploration and feedback. Evidence indicates that RL-like processes exist in many animal species. Key in the processing of feedback in RL is the notion of TD error, the assessment of how much better or worse a situation just became, compared to what was previously expected (or, the estimated gain or loss of utility - or well-being - resulting from new evidence). I propose a TDRL Theory of Emotion and discuss its ramifications for our understanding of emotions in humans, animals and machines, and present psychological, neurobiological and computational evidence in its support.

情绪与动机和行为的适应性密切相关，许多动物物种在行为中表现出情绪的证据。因此，情绪必须与有助于生存的强大机制相关联，并且情绪必须是进化的连续现象。情绪如何以及为何在自然中进化，情绪如何得到情感评估，情绪如何与认知复杂性相关，以及它们如何影响行为和学习？在本文中，我提出所有情绪都是奖励处理的表现形式，特别是时间差异（TD）错误评估。强化学习（RL）是一种强大的计算模型，用于通过探索和反馈来学习面向目标的任务。证据表明许多动物物种中存在类似RL的过程。 RL中反馈处理的关键是TD误差的概念，即对先前预期（或估计的效用或损失的估计增益或损失）的评估，即对情况的好坏程度进行评估。由新证据产生的）。我提出了TDRL情绪理论，并讨论了它对我们对人类，动物和机器中的情绪的理解的影响，并在其支持中提出了心理，神经生物学和计算证据。
