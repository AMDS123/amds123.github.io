##### Abstract
State-of-the-art machine translation (MT) models do not use knowledge of any single language's structure; this is the equivalent of asking someone to translate from English to German while knowing neither language. BALM is a framework incorporates monolingual priors into an MT pipeline; by casting input and output languages into embedded space using BERT, we can solve machine translation with much simpler models. We find that English-to-German translation on the Multi30k dataset can be solved with a simple feedforward network under the BALM framework with near-SOTA BLEU scores.
