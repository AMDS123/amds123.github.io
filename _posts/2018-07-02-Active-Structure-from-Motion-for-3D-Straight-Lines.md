##### Abstract
A reliable estimation of 3D parameters is a must for several applications like planning and control. Included in the latter is the Image-Based Visual Servoing, whose control scheme depends directly on 3D parameters e.g. depth of points, and depth and direction of 3D straight lines. Recently a framework for Active Structure-from-Motion was proposed, addressing the former feature type. However, straight lines were not addressed. These are 1D objects, which allow for more robust detection and tracking. In this work, the problem of Active Structure-from-Motion for 3D straight lines is addressed. An explicit representation of this type of feature is presented, and a change of variables is proposed, which allows the dynamics of the line to respect the conditions for observability of the framework. The approach is validated first in simulation for a single line, and second using a real robot. The latter set of experiments are conducted first for a single line, and then for three lines, which is the minimum required number of lines to control a 6 degree of freedom camera.

对于诸如规划和控制的若干应用，3D参数的可靠估计是必须的。后者包括基于图像的视觉伺服，其控制方案直接取决于3D参数，例如点的深度，3D直线的深度和方向。最近，提出了一种针对前一种特征类型的Active Structure-from-Motion框架。但是，没有解决直线问题。这些是一维对象，可以实现更强大的检测和跟踪。在这项工作中，解决了3D直线的主动结构 - 运动问题。提出了这种类型特征的显式表示，并提出了变量的变化，这允许线的动态遵循框架可观察性的条件。该方法首先在模拟单线时验证，其次使用真实机器人验证。后一组实验首先针对单线进行，然后针对三条线进行，这是控制6自由度相机所需的最小线数。
