##### Abstract
With the rise in popularity of public social media and micro-blogging services, most notably Twitter, the people have found a venue to hear and be heard by their peers without an intermediary. As a consequence, and aided by the public nature of Twitter, political scientists now potentially have the means to analyse and understand the narratives that organically form, spread and decline among the public in a political campaign. However, the volume and diversity of the conversation on Twitter, combined with its noisy and idiosyncratic nature, make this a hard task. Thus, advanced data mining and language processing techniques are required to process and analyse the data. In this paper, we present and evaluate a technical framework, based on recent advances in deep neural networks, for identifying and analysing election-related conversation on Twitter on a continuous, longitudinal basis. Our models can detect election-related tweets with an F-score of 0.92 and can categorize these tweets into 22 topics with an F-score of 0.90.

随着公众社交媒体和微博服务的普及，最显着的是Twitter，人们找到了一个场所，可以听到没有中间人的同行的聆听。因此，在Twitter的公共性质的帮助下，政治学家现在可能有办法分析和理解在政治运动中公众有机形成，传播和衰落的叙述。然而，Twitter上对话的数量和多样性，再加上其嘈杂而特殊的性质，使得这项任务变得艰巨。因此，需要先进的数据挖掘和语言处理技术来处理和分析数据。在本文中，我们提出并评估了一个基于深度神经网络的最新进展的技术框架，用于在连续，纵向的基础上在Twitter上识别和分析与选举相关的对话。我们的模型可以用0.92的F分数检测与选举有关的推文，并且可以将这些推文分类为22个主题，F分数为0.90。
