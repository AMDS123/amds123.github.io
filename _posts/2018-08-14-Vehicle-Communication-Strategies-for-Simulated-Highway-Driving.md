##### Abstract
Interest in emergent communication has recently surged in Machine Learning. The focus of this interest has largely been either on investigating the properties of the learned protocol or on utilizing emergent communication to better solve problems that already have a viable solution. Here, we consider self-driving cars coordinating with each other and focus on how communication influences the agents' collective behavior. Our main result is that communication helps (most) with adverse conditions.

紧急通信的兴趣最近在机器学习中飙升。这种兴趣的焦点主要在于调查学习协议的属性或利用紧急通信来更好地解决已经具有可行解决方案的问题。在这里，我们认为自动驾驶汽车相互协调，并关注通信如何影响代理商的集体行为。我们的主要结果是沟通有助于（大多数）不利条件。
