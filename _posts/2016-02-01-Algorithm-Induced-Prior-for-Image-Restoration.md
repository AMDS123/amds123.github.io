##### Abstract
This paper studies a type of image priors that are constructed implicitly through the alternating direction method of multiplier (ADMM) algorithm, called the algorithm-induced prior. Different from classical image priors which are defined before running the reconstruction algorithm, algorithm-induced priors are defined by the denoising procedure used to replace one of the two modules in the ADMM algorithm. Since such prior is not explicitly defined, analyzing the performance has been difficult in the past. Focusing on the class of symmetric smoothing filters, this paper presents an explicit expression of the prior induced by the ADMM algorithm. The new prior is reminiscent to the conventional graph Laplacian but with stronger reconstruction performance. It can also be shown that the overall reconstruction has an efficient closed-form implementation if the associated symmetric smoothing filter is low rank. The results are validated with experiments on image inpainting.

##### Abstract (translated by Google)
本文研究了一种通过交替方向乘法器（ADMM）算法隐式构造的图像先验，称为算法先验。与运行重建算法之前定义的经典图像先验不同，由用于替换ADMM算法中的两个模块之一的去噪过程来定义算法诱导的先验。既然这样的先例没有明确的定义，过去分析表现一直是困难的。针对这类对称平滑滤波器，本文提出了一种由ADMM算法引入的先验表达式。新的先验令人联想到传统的拉普拉斯图，但是具有更强的重构性能。还可以看出，如果关联的对称平滑滤波器是低秩的，则整体重构具有有效的闭式实现。结果通过图像修补实验验证。
