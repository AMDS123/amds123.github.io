##### Abstract
Scientists in many fields have the common and basic need of dimensionality reduction: visualizing the underlying structure of the massive multivariate data in a low-dimensional space. However, many dimensionality reduction methods confront the so-called "crowding problem" that clusters tend to overlap with each other in the embedding. Previously, researchers expect to avoid that problem and seek to make clusters maximally separated in the embedding. However, the proposed in-tree (IT) based method, called IT-map, allows clusters in the embedding to be locally overlapped, while seeking to make them distinguishable by some small yet key parts. IT-map provides a simple, effective and novel solution to cluster-preserving mapping, which makes it possible to cluster the original data points interactively and thus should be of general meaning in science and engineering.

科学家在许多领域都有降维的共同和基本需求：在低维空间中可视化大规模多元数据的底层结构。然而，许多降维方法面临着所谓的“拥挤问题”，在嵌入中群集倾向于相互重叠。以前，研究人员希望避免这个问题，并试图在嵌入中使群集最大化分离。然而，所提出的基于树状结构（IT）的方法称为IT映射，允许嵌入中的簇局部重叠，同时试图通过一些小而关键的部分来区分它们。 IT-map为保持聚类的映射提供了一种简单，有效和新颖的解决方案，使得原始数据点交互聚集成为可能，因此应该具有科学和工程上的一般意义。
