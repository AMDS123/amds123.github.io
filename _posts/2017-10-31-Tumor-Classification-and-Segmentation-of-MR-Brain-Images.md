##### Abstract
The diagnosis and segmentation of tumors using any medical diagnostic tool can be challenging due to the varying nature of this pathology. Magnetic Reso- nance Imaging (MRI) is an established diagnostic tool for various diseases and disorders and plays a major role in clinical neuro-diagnosis. Supplementing this technique with automated classification and segmentation tools is gaining importance, to reduce errors and time needed to make a conclusive diagnosis. In this paper a simple three-step algorithm is proposed; (1) identification of patients that present with tumors, (2) automatic selection of abnormal slices of the patients, and (3) segmentation and detection of the tumor. Features were extracted by using discrete wavelet transform on the normalized images and classified by support vector machine (for step (1)) and random forest (for step (2)). The 400 subjects were divided in a 3:1 ratio between training and test with no overlap. This study is novel in terms of use of data, as it employed the entire T2 weighted slices as a single image for classification and a unique combination of contralateral approach with patch thresholding for segmentation, which does not require a training set or a template as is used by most segmentation studies. Using the proposed method, the tumors were segmented accurately with a classification accuracy of 95% with 100% specificity and 90% sensitivity.

由于这种病理学的不同性质，使用任何医学诊断工具诊断和分割肿瘤可能是具有挑战性的。磁共振成像（Magnetic Resonance Imaging，MRI）是一种用于各种疾病和病症的既定诊断工具，在临床神经诊断中起主要作用。使用自动分类和分割工具来补充这一技术正变得越来越重要，以减少确定诊断所需的错误和时间。本文提出了一个简单的三步算法， （1）鉴别患有肿瘤的患者，（2）自动选择患者的异常切片，以及（3）分割和检测肿瘤。通过对规格化图像进行离散小波变换提取特征，并通过支持向量机（步骤（1））和随机森林（步骤（2））进行分类。 400名受试者以3：1的比例进行训练和测试，没有重叠。该研究在数据使用方面是新颖的，因为它使用整个T2加权切片作为单个图像进行分类，并且使用对边方法与用于分割的补丁阈值的独特组合，其不需要训练集或模板大多数细分研究使用。使用所提出的方法，肿瘤被精确分割，分类准确性为95％，特异性为100％，灵敏度为90％。
