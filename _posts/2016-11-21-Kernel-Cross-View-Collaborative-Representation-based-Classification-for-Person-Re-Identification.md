##### Abstract
Person re-identification aims at the maintenance of a global identity as a person moves among non-overlapping surveillance cameras. It is a hard task due to different illumination conditions, viewpoints and the small number of annotated individuals from each pair of cameras (small-sample-size problem). Collaborative Representation based Classification (CRC) has been employed successfully to address the small-sample-size problem in computer vision. However, the original CRC formulation is not well-suited for person re-identification since it does not consider that probe and gallery samples are from different cameras. Furthermore, it is a linear model, while appearance changes caused by different camera conditions indicate a strong nonlinear transition between cameras. To overcome such limitations, we propose the Kernel Cross-View Collaborative Representation based Classification (Kernel X-CRC) that represents probe and gallery images by balancing representativeness and similarity nonlinearly. It assumes that a probe and its corresponding gallery image are represented with similar coding vectors using individuals from the training set. Experimental results demonstrate that our assumption is true when using a high-dimensional feature vector and becomes more compelling when dealing with a low-dimensional and discriminative representation computed using a common subspace learning method. We achieve state-of-the-art for rank-1 matching rates in two person re-identification datasets (PRID450S and GRID) and the second best results on VIPeR and CUHK01 datasets.

人重新识别的目的在于维护全球身份，因为人在不重叠的监视摄像机之间移动。由于不同的照明条件，观点和来自每一对相机的少量注释个体（小样本尺寸问题），这是一项艰巨的任务。基于协作表示的分类（CRC）已被成功地用于解决计算机视觉中的小样本大小问题。然而，原始的CRC制定不适合人重新鉴定，因为它不认为探针和画廊样品来自不同的相机。此外，它是一个线性模型，而由不同相机条件引起的外观变化表明相机之间强烈的非线性过渡。为克服这些局限性，本文提出了非线性平衡代表性和相似性的核心交叉视图协作表示分类（Kernel X-CRC）。它假定探测器及其对应的图库图像用来自训练集的个体的相似编码向量表示。实验结果证明，当使用高维特征向量时，我们的假设是真实的，并且在处理使用公共子空间学习方法计算的低维和差别表示时更加引人注目。我们在两人重新识别数据集（PRID450S和GRID）中实现了一级匹配率的最新技术，并且在VIPeR和CUHK01数据集上获得了第二好的结果。
