##### Abstract
Sensing the medical scenario can ensure the safety during the surgical operations. So, in this regard, a monitor platform which can obtain the accurate location information of the surgery room is desperately needed. Compared to 2D camera image, 3D data contains more information of distance and direction. Therefore, 3D sensors are more suitable to be used in surgical scene monitoring. However, each 3D sensor has its own limitations. For example, Lidar (Light Detection and Ranging) can detect large-scale environment with high precision, but the point clouds or depth maps are very sparse. As for commodity RGBD sensors, such as Kinect, can accurately capture denser data, but limited to a small range from 0.5 to 4.5m. So, a proper method which can address these problems for fusing different modalities data is important. In this paper, we proposed a method which can fuse different modalities 3D data to get a large-scale and dense point cloud. The key contributions of our work are as follows. First, we proposed a 3D data collecting system to reconstruct the medical scenes. By fusing the Lidar and Kinect data, a large-scale medical scene with more details can be reconstructed. Second, we proposed a location-based fast point clouds registration algorithm to deal with different modality datasets.

感知医疗场景可以确保外科手术期间的安全性。因此，在这方面，迫切需要一种能够获得手术室的准确位置信息的监视器平台。与2D相机图像相比，3D数据包含更多距离和方向信息。因此，3D传感器更适合用于手术场景监测。但是，每个3D传感器都有其自身的局限性。例如，激光雷达（光探测和测距）可以高精度地探测大规模环境，但点云或深度图非常稀疏。至于商品RGBD传感器，如Kinect，可以准确地捕获更密集的数据，但仅限于0.5到4.5米的小范围。因此，一种能够解决这些问题以融合不同模态数据的适当方法是很重要的。在本文中，我们提出了一种方法，可以融合不同的模态3D数据，以获得大规模和密集的点云。我们工作的主要贡献如下。首先，我们提出了一个3D数据采集系统来重建医疗场景。通过融合激光雷达和Kinect数据，可以重建具有更多细节的大规模医疗场景。其次，我们提出了一种基于位置的快速点云配准算法来处理不同的模态数据集。
