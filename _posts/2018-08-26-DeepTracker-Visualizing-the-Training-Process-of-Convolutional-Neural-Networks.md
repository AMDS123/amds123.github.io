##### Abstract
Deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have achieved remarkable success in various fields. However, training an excellent CNN is practically a trial-and-error process that consumes a tremendous amount of time and computer resources. To accelerate the training process and reduce the number of trials, experts need to understand what has occurred in the training process and why the resulting CNN behaves as such. However, current popular training platforms, such as TensorFlow, only provide very little and general information, such as training/validation errors, which is far from enough to serve this purpose. To bridge this gap and help domain experts with their training tasks in a practical environment, we propose a visual analytics system, DeepTracker, to facilitate the exploration of the rich dynamics of CNN training processes and to identify the unusual patterns that are hidden behind the huge amount of training log. Specifically,we combine a hierarchical index mechanism and a set of hierarchical small multiples to help experts explore the entire training log from different levels of detail. We also introduce a novel cube-style visualization to reveal the complex correlations among multiple types of heterogeneous training data including neuron weights, validation images, and training iterations. Three case studies are conducted to demonstrate how DeepTracker provides its users with valuable knowledge in an industry-level CNN training process, namely in our case, training ResNet-50 on the ImageNet dataset. We show that our method can be easily applied to other state-of-the-art "very deep" CNN models.

深度卷积神经网络（CNN）在各个领域取得了显着的成功。然而，培训优秀的CNN实际上是一个反复试验的过程，耗费了大量的时间和计算机资源。为了加快培训过程并减少试验次数，专家需要了解培训过程中发生的情况以及由此产生的CNN表现的原因。然而，目前流行的培训平台，例如TensorFlow，仅提供非常少的一般信息，例如培训/验证错误，这远远不足以实现此目的。为了弥合这一差距并帮助领域专家在实际环境中完成培训任务，我们提出了一个可视化分析系统DeepTracker，以便于探索CNN培训流程的丰富动态，并识别隐藏在巨大背后的异常模式。培训日志量。具体来说，我们结合了层次索引机制和一组分层小倍数，以帮助专家从不同的细节层次探索整个培训日志。我们还引入了一种新颖的立方体式可视化，以揭示多种类型的异构训练数据之间的复杂相关性，包括神经元权重，验证图像和训练迭代。进行了三个案例研究，以展示DeepTracker如何为其用户提供行业级CNN培训流程中的宝贵知识，即在我们的案例中，在ImageNet数据集上培训ResNet-50。我们表明，我们的方法可以很容易地应用于其他最先进的“非常深”的CNN模型。
