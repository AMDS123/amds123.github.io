##### Abstract
In recent years linguistic typology, which classifies the world's languages according to their functional and structural properties, has been widely used to support multilingual NLP. While the growing importance of typological information in supporting multilingual tasks has been recognised, no systematic survey of existing typological resources and their use in NLP has been published. This paper provides such a survey as well as discussion which we hope will both inform and inspire future work in the area.

##### Abstract (translated by Google)
近年来，根据语言的功能和结构特性对世界语言进行分类的语言类型学被广泛​​用于支持多语言NLP。虽然类型信息在支持多语种任务方面的重要性日益增加，但是现有类型学资源及其在NLP中的使用还没有系统的调查。本文提供了这样一个调查和讨论，我们希望能够通知和激励未来在这个领域的工作。
