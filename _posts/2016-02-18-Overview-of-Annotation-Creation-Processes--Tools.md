##### Abstract
Creating linguistic annotations requires more than just a reliable annotation scheme. Annotation can be a complex endeavour potentially involving many people, stages, and tools. This chapter outlines the process of creating end-to-end linguistic annotations, identifying specific tasks that researchers often perform. Because tool support is so central to achieving high quality, reusable annotations with low cost, the focus is on identifying capabilities that are necessary or useful for annotation tools, as well as common problems these tools present that reduce their utility. Although examples of specific tools are provided in many cases, this chapter concentrates more on abstract capabilities and problems because new tools appear continuously, while old tools disappear into disuse or disrepair. The two core capabilities tools must have are support for the chosen annotation scheme and the ability to work on the language under study. Additional capabilities are organized into three categories: those that are widely provided; those that often useful but found in only a few tools; and those that have as yet little or no available tool support.

##### Abstract (translated by Google)
创建语言注释需要的不仅仅是一个可靠的注释方案。注释可能是一个复杂的尝试，可能涉及许多人，阶段和工具。本章概述创建端到端语言注释的过程，确定研究人员经常执行的具体任务。由于工具支持对于以低成本实现高质量，可重复使用的注释至关重要，因此重点在于确定注释工具所必需或有用的功能，以及这些工具存在的常见问题，从而降低其效用。尽管在许多情况下提供了具体工具的例子，但是本章更多地集中在抽象的能力和问题上，因为新的工具不断出现，而旧的工具则消失或失修。这两个核心功能工具必须支持所选择的注释方案，以及使用所研究语言的能力。其他功能分为三类：广泛提供的功能;那些经常有用但只有少数工具才能找到的东西;那些还没有或没有可用的工具支持。
