##### Abstract
Brain tumor segmentation plays a pivotal role in medical image processing. In this work, we aim to segment brain MRI volumes. 3D convolution neural networks (CNN) such as 3D U-Net and V-Net employing 3D convolutions to capture the correlation between adjacent slices have achieved impressive segmentation results. However, these 3D CNN architectures come with high computational overheads due to multiple layers of 3D convolutions, which may make these models prohibitive for practical large-scale applications. To this end, we propose a highly efficient 3D CNN to achieve real-time dense volumetric segmentation. The network leverages the 3D multi-fiber unit which consists of an ensemble of lightweight 3D convolutional networks to significantly reduce the computational cost. Moreover, 3D dilated convolutions are used to build multi-scale feature representations. Extensive experimental results on the BraTS-2018 challenge dataset show that the proposed architecture greatly reduces computation cost while maintaining high accuracy for brain tumor segmentation. Our code will be released soon.
