##### Abstract
Children can use the statistical regularities of their environment to learn word meanings, a mechanism known as cross-situational learning. We take a computational approach to investigate how the information present during each observation in a cross-situational framework can affect the overall acquisition of word meanings. We do so by formulating various in-the-moment learning mechanisms that are sensitive to different statistics of the environment, such as counts and conditional probabilities. Each mechanism introduces a unique source of competition or mutual exclusivity bias to the model; the mechanism that maximally uses the model's knowledge of word meanings performs the best. Moreover, the gap between this mechanism and others is amplified in more challenging learning scenarios, such as learning from few examples.

孩子们可以利用他们的环境的统计规律来学习单词的意义，一种称为跨情境学习的机制。我们采用计算方法来调查跨情境框架中每个观察期间所呈现的信息如何影响词义的整体获取。我们通过制定各种对环境的不同统计数据敏感的即时学习机制（如计数和条件概率）来实现这一目标。每种机制都为模型引入了独特的竞争或相互排斥的来源;最大限度地利用模型对词义的认识的机制表现最好。而且，这种机制与其他机制之间的差距在更具挑战性的学习场景中得到放大，例如从少数例子中学习。
