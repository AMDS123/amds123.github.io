##### Abstract
Heterogeneous face recognition between color image and depth image is a much desired capacity for real world applications where shape information is looked upon as merely involved in gallery. In this paper, we propose a cross-modal deep learning method as an effective and efficient workaround for this challenge. Specifically, we begin with learning two convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to extract 2D and 2.5D face features individually. Once trained, they can serve as pre-trained models for another two-way CNN which explores the correlated part between color and depth for heterogeneous matching. Compared with most conventional cross-modal approaches, our method additionally conducts accurate depth image reconstruction from single color image with Conditional Generative Adversarial Nets (cGAN), and further enhances the recognition performance by fusing multi-modal matching results. Through both qualitative and quantitative experiments on benchmark FRGC 2D/3D face database, we demonstrate that the proposed pipeline outperforms state-of-the-art performance on heterogeneous face recognition and ensures a drastically efficient on-line stage.

彩色图像和深度图像之间的异类人脸识别是现实世界应用中期望的能力，其中形状信息被看作仅仅涉及画廊。在本文中，我们提出了一种跨模态的深度学习方法作为解决这个挑战的有效和高效的方法。具体来说，我们从学习两个卷积神经网络（CNN）开始，分别提取2D和2.5D人脸特征。一旦训练完毕，它们可以作为另一个双向CNN的预训练模型，探索异质匹配的颜色和深度之间的相关部分。与传统的多模态方法相比，本文方法利用条件生成对抗网络（cGAN）从单一颜色图像中进一步进行准确的深度图像重构，并通过融合多模匹配结果进一步提高了识别性能。通过对基准FRGC 2D / 3D人脸数据库进行定性和定量实验，我们证明了所提出的管道在异构人脸识别方面的性能优于最先进的性能，并确保了在线舞台的高效率。
