##### Abstract
In this paper, we contrive a stereo matching algorithm with careful handling of disparity, discontinuity and occlusion. This algorithm works a worldwide matching stereo model which is based on minimization of energy. The global energy comprises two terms, firstly the data term and secondly the smoothness term. The data term is approximated by a color-weighted correlation, then refined in obstruct and low-texture areas in many applications of hierarchical loopy belief propagation algorithm. The results during the experiment are evaluated on the Middlebury data sets, showing that out algorithm is the top performer among all the algorithms listed there

在本文中，我们设计了一个立体匹配算法，仔细处理视差，不连续性和遮挡。该算法运行基于能量最小化的全球匹配立体模型。全球能源包括两个术语，第一个是数据术语，第二个是平滑术语。数据项通过颜色加权相关近似，然后在许多分层loopy置信传播算法的应用中在阻碍和低纹理区域中被细化。在Middlebury数据集上对实验结果进行了评估，结果表明out算法是所有算法中性能最好的
