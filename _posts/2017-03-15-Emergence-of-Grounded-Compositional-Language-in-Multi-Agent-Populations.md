##### Abstract
By capturing statistical patterns in large corpora, machine learning has enabled significant advances in natural language processing, including in machine translation, question answering, and sentiment analysis. However, for agents to intelligently interact with humans, simply capturing the statistical patterns is insufficient. In this paper we investigate if, and how, grounded compositional language can emerge as a means to achieve goals in multi-agent populations. Towards this end, we propose a multi-agent learning environment and learning methods that bring about emergence of a basic compositional language. This language is represented as streams of abstract discrete symbols uttered by agents over time, but nonetheless has a coherent structure that possesses a defined vocabulary and syntax. We also observe emergence of non-verbal communication such as pointing and guiding when language communication is unavailable.

##### Abstract (translated by Google)
通过捕捉大型语料库中的统计模式，机器学习使自然语言处理（包括机器翻译，问题回答和情感分析）取得了重大进展。但是，对于代理人智能地与人类交互，简单地捕捉统计模式是不够的。在本文中，我们将研究是否以及如何基础成分语言作为实现多智体人群目标的手段出现。为此，我们提出了一个多智能体的学习环境和学习方法，使得基本构图语言的出现。这种语言被表示为代理随着时间的推移而发出的抽象离散符号流，但是却具有连贯的结构，具有定义的词汇和句法。当语言交流不可用时，我们也观察到非语言交流的出现，如指点和引导。
