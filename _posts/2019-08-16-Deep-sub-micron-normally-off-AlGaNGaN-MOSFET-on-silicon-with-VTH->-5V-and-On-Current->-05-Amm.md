##### Abstract
We report on the demonstration of a deep sub-micron normally-off AlGaN/GaN HEMT with high on-current and high threshold voltage (VTH). The high-performance device was realized by utilizing a gate recess with length and depth of 200 nm and 124 nm respectively. The recess etched region had a roughness of 0.7 nm. Various recess etch depths and dielectric annealing conditions were used to tune the VTH. The optimized device exhibited on-current and VTH of 500 mA/mm and 5 V respectively. The measured breakdown characteristics of the devices and their limitations were investigated using 2D-TCAD device simulation. The penetration of the residual electric field in most of the recess region could be the reason for the premature breakdown of deeply scaled recess-gate e-mode HEMTs.
