##### Abstract
Recently, Deep Learning has been showing promising results in various Artificial Intelligence applications like image recognition, natural language processing, language modeling, neural machine translation, etc. Although, in general, it is computationally more expensive as compared to classical machine learning techniques, their results are found to be more effective in some cases. Therefore, in this paper, we investigated and compared one of the Deep Learning Architecture called Deep Neural Network (DNN) with the classical Random Forest (RF) machine learning algorithm for the malware classification. We studied the performance of the classical RF and DNN with 2, 4 &amp; 7 layers architectures with the four different feature sets, and found that irrespective of the features inputs, the classical RF accuracy outperforms the DNN.

最近，深度学习已经在各种人工智能应用中展示了有希望的结果，如图像识别，自然语言处理，语言建模，神经机器翻译等。虽然一般来说，与传统的机器学习技术相比，它在计算上更昂贵，但是结果发现在某些情况下更有效。因此，在本文中，我们调查并比较了一种称为深度神经网络（DNN）的深度学习架构和用于恶意软件分类的经典随机森林（RF）机器学习算法。我们用2,4和4来研究经典RF和DNN的性能。 7层架构具有四种不同的功能集，并且发现无论输入功能如何，经典的RF精度都优于DNN。
