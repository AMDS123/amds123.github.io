##### Abstract
A rapid pattern-recognition approach to characterize driver's curve-negotiating behavior is proposed. To shorten the recognition time and improve the recognition of driving styles, a k-means clustering-based support vector machine ( kMC-SVM) method is developed and used for classifying drivers into two types: aggressive and moderate. First, vehicle speed and throttle opening are treated as the feature parameters to reflect the driving styles. Second, to discriminate driver curve-negotiating behaviors and reduce the number of support vectors, the k-means clustering method is used to extract and gather the two types of driving data and shorten the recognition time. Then, based on the clustering results, a support vector machine approach is utilized to generate the hyperplane for judging and predicting to which types the human driver are subject. Lastly, to verify the validity of the kMC-SVM method, a cross-validation experiment is designed and conducted. The research results show that the $ k $MC-SVM is an effective method to classify driving styles with a short time, compared with SVM method.

提出了一种快速的模式识别方法来表征驾驶员的曲线谈判行为。为缩短识别时间，提高对驾驶风格的认识，提出了一种基于k均值聚类的支持向量机（kMC-SVM）方法，将驾驶员分为积极和中等两种类型。首先将车速和油门开度作为特征参数来反映驾驶风格。其次，为了区分驾驶员曲线协商行为和减少支持向量的数量，采用k均值聚类方法提取和采集两类驾驶数据，缩短识别时间。然后，基于聚类结果，利用支持向量机方法生成超平面，用于判断和预测驾驶员所经历的类型。最后，为了验证kMC-SVM方法的有效性，设计并实施了一个交叉验证实验。研究结果表明，与支持向量机方法相比，$ k $ MC-SVM是一种短时间内对驾驶风格进行分类的有效方法。
