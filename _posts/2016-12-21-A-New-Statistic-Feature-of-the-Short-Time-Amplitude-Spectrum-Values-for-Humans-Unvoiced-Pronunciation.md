##### Abstract
In this paper, a new statistic feature of the discrete short-time amplitude spectrum is discovered by experiments for the signals of unvoiced pronunciation. For the random-varying short-time spectrum, this feature reveals the relationship between the amplitude's average and its standard for every frequency component. On the other hand, the association between the amplitude distributions for different frequency components is also studied. A new model representing such association is inspired by the normalized histogram of amplitude. By mathematical analysis, the new statistic feature discovered is proved to be necessary evidence which supports the proposed model, and also can be direct evidence for the widely used hypothesis of "identical distribution of amplitude for all frequencies".

本文通过对清音发音信号的实验，发现了离散短时幅频谱的一个新的统计特征。对于随机变化的短时频谱，该特征揭示了每个频率分量的幅度平均值与其标准之间的关系。另一方面，也研究了不同频率分量的振幅分布之间的关系。表示这种关联的新模型受振幅归一化直方图的启发。通过数学分析，证明了所发现的新统计特征是支持所提出模型的必要证据，也可以为广泛使用的“所有频率幅值均匀分布”假设提供直接证据。
