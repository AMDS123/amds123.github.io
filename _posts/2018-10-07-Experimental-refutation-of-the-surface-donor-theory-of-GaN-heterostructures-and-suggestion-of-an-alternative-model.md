##### Abstract
We have evaluated the density of interface trap states (Dit) on the surface of a GaN/AlGaN/GaN heterojunction by conventional and UV assisted gated van der Pauw experiments. The obtained values are about two orders of magnitude lower than required by the surface-donor theory. Yet, the surface-donor model is currently the only theory that predicts the variation of the 2DEG concentration with barrier thickness. Previous experimental studies using a variety of other techniques reported similar low Dit values. We hence conclude that variable midgap surface-charge is not responsible for the formation of the two dimensional electron gas. As the only other candidates for the formation of the surface-charge are valence electrons and ion cores, we propose that a slight shift of the surface ions from their charge neutrality positon results in fixed surface-charge. The same mechanism can also explain how the large surface polarization charge in bulk GaN is compensated. We attribute the variation of the 2DEG concentration with barrier thickness to the barrier thickness dependent strain energy, required to sustain the interface ion shift from their charge neutrality position.
