##### Abstract
Pose detection is one of the fundamental steps for the recognition of human actions. In this paper we propose a novel trainable detector for recognizing human poses based on the analysis of the skeleton. The main idea is that a skeleton pose can be described by the spatial arrangements of its joints. Starting from this consideration, we propose a trainable pose detector, that can be configured on a prototype skeleton in an automatic configuration process. The result of the configuration is a model of the position of the joints in the concerned skeleton. In the application phase, the joint positions contained in the model are compared with the ones of their homologous joints in the skeleton under test. The similarity of two skeletons is computed as a combination of the position scores achieved by homologous joints. In this paper we describe an action classification method based on the use of the proposed trainable detectors to extract features from the skeletons. We performed experiments on the publicly available MSDRA data set and the achieved results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

##### Abstract (translated by Google)
姿态检测是识别人类行为的基本步骤之一。在本文中，我们提出了一种基于骨架分析的可识别人体姿态的新型可训练探测器。主要思想是通过其关节的空间布局来描述骨架姿态。从这个考虑出发，我们提出了一个可训练的姿态检测器，可以在自动配置过程中在原型骨架上进行配置。配置的结果是相关骨架中关节位置的模型。在应用阶段，将模型中包含的关节位置与被测骨架中的关节位置进行比较。两个骨架的相似性被计算为通过同源关节获得的位置分数的组合。在本文中，我们描述了一个行动分类方法的基础上使用提出的可训练探测器从骨骼提取特征。我们对公开可用的MSDRA数据集进行了实验，实现的结果证实了所提出方法的有效性。
