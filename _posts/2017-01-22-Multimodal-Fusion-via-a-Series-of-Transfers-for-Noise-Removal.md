##### Abstract
Near-infrared imaging has been considered as a solution to provide high quality photographs in dim lighting conditions. This imaging system captures two types of multimodal images: one is near-infrared gray image (NGI) and the other is the visible color image (VCI). NGI is noise-free but it is grayscale, whereas the VCI has colors but it contains noise. Moreover, there exist serious edge and brightness discrepancies between NGI and VCI. To deal with this problem, a new transfer-based fusion method is proposed for noise removal. Different from conventional fusion approaches, the proposed method conducts a series of transfers: contrast, detail, and color transfers. First, the proposed contrast and detail transfers aim at solving the serious discrepancy problem, thereby creating a new noise-free and detail-preserving NGI. Second, the proposed color transfer models the unknown colors from the denoised VCI via a linear transform, and then transfers natural-looking colors into the newly generated NGI. Experimental results show that the proposed transfer-based fusion method is highly successful in solving the discrepancy problem, thereby describing edges and textures clearly as well as removing noise completely on the fused images. Most of all, the proposed method is superior to conventional fusion methods and guided filtering, and even the state-of-the-art fusion methods based on scale map and layer decomposition.

近红外成像被认为是在昏暗的照明条件下提供高质量照片的解决方案。该成像系统捕获两种多模态图像：一种是近红外灰度图像（NGI），另一种是可见彩色图像（VCI）。 NGI是无噪声的，但它是灰度的，而VCI有颜色，但包含噪音。而且，NGI和VCI之间存在严重的边缘和亮度差异。针对这个问题，提出了一种新的基于转移的融合方法来消除噪声。与传统的融合方法不同，所提出的方法进行一系列的转移：对比，细节和颜色转移。首先，提出的对比度和细节转换旨在解决严重的差异问题，从而创建一个新的无噪声和细节保护的NGI。其次，所提议的颜色转换通过线性变换来对去噪的VCI中的未知颜色进行建模，然后将自然的颜色转移到新产生的NGI中。实验结果表明，所提出的基于转移的融合方法在解决差异问题方面非常成功，从而清晰地描述了边缘和纹理，并且在融合图像上完全消除了噪声。最重要的是，所提出的方法优于传统的融合方法和引导滤波，甚至是基于尺度图和层分解的最新融合方法。
