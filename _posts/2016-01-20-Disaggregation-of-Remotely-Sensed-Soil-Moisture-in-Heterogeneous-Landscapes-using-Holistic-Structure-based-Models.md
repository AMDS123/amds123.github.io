##### Abstract
In this study, a novel machine learning algorithm is presented for disaggregation of satellite soil moisture (SM) based on self-regularized regressive models (SRRM) using high-resolution correlated information from auxiliary sources. It includes regularized clustering that assigns soft memberships to each pixel at fine-scale followed by a kernel regression that computes the value of the desired variable at all pixels. Coarse-scale remotely sensed SM were disaggregated from 10km to 1km using land cover, precipitation, land surface temperature, leaf area index, and in-situ observations of SM. This algorithm was evaluated using multi-scale synthetic observations in NC Florida for heterogeneous agricultural land covers. It was found that the root mean square error (RMSE) for 96% of the pixels was less than 0.02 $m^3/m^3$. The clusters generated represented the data well and reduced the RMSE by upto 40% during periods of high heterogeneity in land-cover and meteorological conditions. The Kullback Leibler divergence (KLD) between the true SM and the disaggregated estimates is close to 0, for both vegetated and baresoil landcovers. The disaggregated estimates were compared to those generated by the Principle of Relevant Information (PRI) method. The RMSE for the PRI disaggregated estimates is higher than the RMSE for the SRRM on each day of the season. The KLD of the disaggregated estimates generated by the SRRM is at least four orders of magnitude lower than those for the PRI disaggregated estimates, while the computational time needed was reduced by three times. The results indicate that the SRRM can be used for disaggregating SM with complex non-linear correlations on a grid with high accuracy.

在这项研究中，提出了一种新的基于自调节回归模型（SRRM）的卫星土壤水分分解的机器学习算法（SRRM），使用辅助来源的高分辨率相关信息。它包括正则化聚类，将软成员分配给每个像素，然后进行内核回归，计算所有像素中所需变量的值。利用土地覆盖，降水，地表温度，叶面积指数和SM的现场观测资料，将大尺度遥感SM分解为10km-1km。该算法是在佛罗里达州的多尺度综合观测中评估异质农地覆盖。发现96％像素的均方根误差（RMSE）小于0.02 $立方公尺/立方公尺。所产生的集群代表了数据，在土地覆盖和气象条件非均匀性高的时段，RMSE降低了40％。对于植被和裸地的土地覆盖而言，真实SM与分类估算之间的Kullback Leibler散度（KLD）接近于0。将分类的估计数与相关信息原则（PRI）方法所产生的估计数进行了比较。 PRI分解估算的RMSE高于本季节每天SRRM的RMSE。 SRRM分解估计的KLD至少比PRI分解估计低4个数量级，而计算所需时间减少了3倍。结果表明，SRRM可以用于高精度地分解具有复杂非线性相关性的SM。
