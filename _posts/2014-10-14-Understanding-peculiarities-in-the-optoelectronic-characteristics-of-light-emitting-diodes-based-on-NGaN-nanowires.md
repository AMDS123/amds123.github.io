##### Abstract
We investigate the effect of the p-type top contact on the optoelectronic characteristics of light emitting diodes (LEDs) based on (In,Ga)N/GaN nanowire (NW) ensembles grown by molecular beam epitaxy on Si substrates. We compare devices fabricated with either Ni/Au or indium tin oxide (ITO) top contact. The NW-LEDs with ITO exhibit a number density of NWs emitting electroluminescence about ten times higher, significantly lower turn-on voltage and series resistance, and a relative external quantum efficiency more than one order of magnitude higher than the sample with Ni/Au. These results show that limitations in the performance of such devices reported so far can be overcome by improving the p-type top-contact.
