##### Abstract
In this paper, we propose an intelligence approach based on fuzzy logic to modeling human intelligence in washing clothes. At first, an intelligent feedback loop is designed for perception-based sensing of dirt inspired by human color understanding. Then, when color stains leak out of some colored clothes the human probabilistic decision making is computationally modeled to detect this stain leakage and thus the problem of recognizing dirt from stain can be considered in the washing process. Finally, we discuss the fuzzy control of washing clothes and design and simulate a smart controller based on the fuzzy intelligence feedback loop.
