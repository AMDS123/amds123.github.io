##### Abstract
Sentiment Analysis in Arabic is a challenging task due to the rich morphology of the language. Moreover, the task is further complicated when applied to Twitter data that is known to be highly informal and noisy. In this paper, we develop a hybrid method for sentiment analysis for Arabic tweets for a specific Arabic dialect which is the Saudi Dialect. Several features were engineered and evaluated using a feature backward selection method. Then a hybrid method that combines a corpus-based and lexicon-based method was developed for several classification models (two-way, three-way, four-way). The best F1-score for each of these models was (69.9,61.63,55.07) respectively.

由于语言丰富的形态，阿拉伯语的情感分析是一项具有挑战性的任务。此外，当应用于已知非常非正式且嘈杂的Twitter数据时，该任务更加复杂。在本文中，我们为沙特阿拉伯方言的特定阿拉伯方言开发了阿拉伯语推文情感分析的混合方法。使用功能反向选择方法设计和评估了几项功能。然后，针对几种分类模型（双向，三向，四向）开发了一种将基于语料库和基于词典的方法相结合的混合方法。每个模型的最佳F1分数分别为（69.9,61.63,55.07）。
