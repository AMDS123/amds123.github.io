##### Abstract
The structural analysis of shape boundaries leads to the characterization of objects as well as to the understanding of shape properties. The literature on graphs and networks have contributed to the structural characterization of shapes with different theoretical approaches. We performed a study on the relationship between the shape architecture and the network topology constructed over the shape boundary. For that, we used a method for network modeling proposed in 2009. Firstly, together with curvature analysis, we evaluated the proposed approach for regular polygons. This way, it was possible to investigate how the network measurements vary according to some specific shape properties. Secondly, we evaluated the performance of the proposed shape descriptor in classification tasks for three datasets, accounting for both real-world and synthetic shapes. We demonstrated that not only degree related measurements are capable of distinguishing classes of objects. Yet, when using measurements that account for distinct properties of the network structure, the construction of the shape descriptor becomes more computationally efficient. Given the fact the network is dynamically constructed, the number of iterations can be reduced. The proposed approach accounts for a more robust set of structural measurements, that improved the discriminant power of the shape descriptors.

形状边界的结构分析导致物体的表征以及对形状特性的理解。关于图形和网络的文献已经用不同的理论方法对形状的结构表征做出了贡献。我们对形状结构和在形状边界上构建的网络拓扑之间的关系进行了研究。为此，我们在2009年提出了一种网络建模方法。首先，结合曲率分析，我们评估了正则多边形的提出方法。这样，有可能调查网络测量结果如何根据一些特定的形状属性而变化。其次，我们评估了在三个数据集的分类任务中所提出的形状描述符的性能，考虑了现实世界和合成形状。我们证明了不仅程度相关的度量能够区分对象的类别。然而，当使用考虑网络结构的不同特性的测量时，形状描述符的构造变得更加计算效率高。鉴于网络是动态构建的，可以减少迭代的次数。所提出的方法考虑了更稳健的一组结构测量，这改善了形状描述符的判别能力。
