##### Abstract
Accurately counting maize tassels is important for monitoring the growth status of maize plants. This tedious task, however, is still mainly done by manual efforts. In the context of modern plant phenotyping, automating this task is required to meet the need of large-scale analysis of genotype and phenotype. In recent years, computer vision technologies have experienced a significant breakthrough due to the emergence of large-scale datasets and increased computational resources. Naturally image-based approaches have also received much attention in plant-related studies. Yet a fact is that most image-based systems for plant phenotyping are deployed under controlled laboratory environment. When transferring the application scenario to unconstrained in-field conditions, intrinsic and extrinsic variations in the wild pose great challenges for accurate counting of maize tassels, which goes beyond the ability of conventional image processing techniques. This calls for further robust computer vision approaches to address in-field variations. This paper studies the in-field counting problem of maize tassels. To our knowledge, this is the first time that a plant-related counting problem is considered using computer vision technologies under unconstrained field-based environment.

##### Abstract (translated by Google)
准确计数玉米穗是监测玉米植株生长状况的重要手段。然而，这个乏味的任务仍然主要是通过人工来完成的。在现代植物表型的情况下，自动化这项任务需要满足基因型和表型的大规模分析的需要。近年来，由于大规模数据集的出现和计算资源的增加，计算机视觉技术已经经历了重大的突破。自然基于图像的方法在植物相关的研究中也受到了很多关注。但事实上，大多数基于图像的植物表型分析系统都是在受控的实验室环境下部署的。在将应用场景转换为不受限制的现场条件时，野外的内在和外在变化对玉米流苏的精确计数提出了巨大的挑战，超出了传统图像处理技术的能力。这需要进一步强大的计算机视觉方法来解决现场的变化。本文研究了玉米流苏的田间计数问题。据我们所知，这是第一次在无约束的现场环境下使用计算机视觉技术来考虑与植物有关的计数问题。
