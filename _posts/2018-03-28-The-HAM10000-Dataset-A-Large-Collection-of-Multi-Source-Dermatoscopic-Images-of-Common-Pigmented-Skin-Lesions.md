##### Abstract
Training of neural networks for automated diagnosis of pigmented skin lesions is hampered by the small size and lack of diversity of available datasets of dermatoscopic images. We tackle this problem by releasing the HAM10000 ("Human Against Machine with 10000 training images") dataset. We collected dermatoscopic images from different populations acquired and stored by different modalities. Given this diversity we had to apply different acquisition and cleaning methods and developed semi-automatic workflows utilizing specifically trained neural networks. The final dataset consists of 11788 dermatoscopic images, of which 10010 will be released as a training set for academic machine learning purposes and will be publicly available through the ISIC archive. This benchmark dataset can be used for machine learning and for comparisons with human experts. Cases include a representative collection of all important diagnostic categories in the realm of pigmented lesions. More than 50% of lesions have been confirmed by pathology, the ground truth for the rest of the cases was either follow-up, expert consensus, or confirmation by in-vivo confocal microscopy.

神经网络训练用于自动诊断色素性皮肤损伤受到皮肤镜图像可用数据集的小尺寸和缺乏多样性的阻碍。我们通过发布HAM10000（“具有10000个训练图像的人类对抗机器”）数据集来解决这个问题。我们收集来自不同人群的皮肤镜图像，通过不同的方式采集和储存。鉴于这种多样性，我们必须应用不同的采集和清洁方法，并开发利用专门训练过的神经网络的半自动工作流程。最终数据集包括11788张皮肤镜图像，其中10010将作为学术机器学习目的的训练集发布，并将通过ISIC档案公开发布。这个基准数据集可以用于机器学习和与人类专家进行比较。病例包括在色素性病变领域的所有重要诊断类别的代表性收集。超过50％的病变已经被病理证实，其余病例的基础事实是后续，专家共识或通过体内共聚焦显微镜确认。
