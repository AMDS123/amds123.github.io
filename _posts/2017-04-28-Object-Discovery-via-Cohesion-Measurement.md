##### Abstract
Color and intensity are two important components in an image. Usually, groups of image pixels, which are similar in color or intensity, are an informative representation for an object. They are therefore particularly suitable for computer vision tasks, such as saliency detection and object proposal generation. However, image pixels, which share a similar real-world color, may be quite different since colors are often distorted by intensity. In this paper, we reinvestigate the affinity matrices originally used in image segmentation methods based on spectral clustering. A new affinity matrix, which is robust to color distortions, is formulated for object discovery. Moreover, a Cohesion Measurement (CM) for object regions is also derived based on the formulated affinity matrix. Based on the new Cohesion Measurement, a novel object discovery method is proposed to discover objects latent in an image by utilizing the eigenvectors of the affinity matrix. Then we apply the proposed method to both saliency detection and object proposal generation. Experimental results on several evaluation benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed CM based method has achieved promising performance for these two tasks.

颜色和强度是图像中两个重要的组成部分。通常，在颜色或强度上相似的图像像素组是对象的信息表示。因此，它们特别适用于计算机视觉任务，如显着性检测和对象建议生成。然而，共享相似的真实世界颜色的图像像素可能是非常不同的，因为颜色经常被强度扭曲。在本文中，我们重新研究了基于谱聚类的原始图像分割方法中的亲和矩阵。制定了一个新的亲和力矩阵，它对颜色失真具有鲁棒性。此外，还基于所制定的亲和度矩阵来导出对象区域的内聚度测量（CM）。基于新的凝聚力测量，提出了一种利用亲和矩阵的特征向量发现图像中潜在物体的新型目标发现方法。然后，我们将所提出的方法应用于显着性检测和对象建议生成。在几个评估基准的实验结果表明，提出的基于CM的方法已经取得了前景这两项任务的性能。
