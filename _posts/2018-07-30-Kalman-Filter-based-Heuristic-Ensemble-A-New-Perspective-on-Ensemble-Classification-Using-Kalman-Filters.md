##### Abstract
A classifier ensemble is a combination of multiple diverse classifier models whose outputs are aggregated into a single prediction. Ensembles have been repeatedly shown to perform better than single classifier models, therefore ensembles has been always a subject of research. The objective of this paper is to introduce a new perspective on ensemble classification by considering the training of the ensemble as a state estimation problem. The state is estimated using noisy measurements, and these measurements are then combined using a Kalman filter, within which heuristics are used. An implementation of this perspective, Kalman Filter based Heuristic Ensemble (KFHE), is also presented in this paper. Experiments performed on several datasets, indicate the effectiveness and the potential of KFHE when compared with boosting and bagging. Moreover, KFHE was found to perform comparatively better than bagging and boosting in the case of datasets with noisy class label assignments.

分类器集合是多个不同分类器模型的组合，其输出被聚合成单个预测。已经多次证明合奏比单一分类器模型表现更好，因此合奏一直是研究的主题。本文的目的是通过将集合训练视为状态估计问题，引入集合分类的新视角。使用噪声测量估计状态，然后使用卡尔曼滤波器组合这些测量，其中使用启发式算法。本文还介绍了基于卡尔曼滤波器的启发式集合（KFHE）的这种观点的实现。在几个数据集上进行的实验表明，与增强和装袋相比，KFHE的有效性和潜力。此外，在具有噪声类标签分配的数据集的情况下，发现KFHE比套袋和增强效果更好。
