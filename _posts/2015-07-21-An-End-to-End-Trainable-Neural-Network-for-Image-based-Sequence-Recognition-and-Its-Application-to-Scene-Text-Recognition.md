##### Abstract
Image-based sequence recognition has been a long-standing research topic in computer vision. In this paper, we investigate the problem of scene text recognition, which is among the most important and challenging tasks in image-based sequence recognition. A novel neural network architecture, which integrates feature extraction, sequence modeling and transcription into a unified framework, is proposed. Compared with previous systems for scene text recognition, the proposed architecture possesses four distinctive properties: (1) It is end-to-end trainable, in contrast to most of the existing algorithms whose components are separately trained and tuned. (2) It naturally handles sequences in arbitrary lengths, involving no character segmentation or horizontal scale normalization. (3) It is not confined to any predefined lexicon and achieves remarkable performances in both lexicon-free and lexicon-based scene text recognition tasks. (4) It generates an effective yet much smaller model, which is more practical for real-world application scenarios. The experiments on standard benchmarks, including the IIIT-5K, Street View Text and ICDAR datasets, demonstrate the superiority of the proposed algorithm over the prior arts. Moreover, the proposed algorithm performs well in the task of image-based music score recognition, which evidently verifies the generality of it.

基于图像的序列识别一直是计算机视觉领域的一个长期研究课题。在本文中，我们研究了场景文本识别的问题，这是基于图像的序列识别中最重要和最具挑战性的任务之一。提出了一种将特征提取，序列建模和转录融合为一个统一框架的神经网络结构。与以前的场景文本识别系统相比，所提出的体系结构具有四个独特的性质：（1）端到端的可训练性，与大多数现有算法分别进行训练和调整。 （2）自然处理任意长度的序列，不涉及字符分割或水平尺度归一化。 （3）不局限于任何预定义的词典，在无词典和基于词典的场景文本识别任务中都取得了显着的性能。 （4）它产生了一个有效而又小得多的模型，对于现实世界的应用场景来说更实用。包括IIIT-5K，Street View Text和ICDAR数据集在内的标准基准的实验证明了所提出算法相对于现有技术的优越性。此外，该算法在基于图像的乐谱识别任务中表现良好，证明了该算法的通用性。
