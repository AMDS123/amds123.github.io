##### Abstract
Corpus Pattern Analysis (CPA) has been the topic of Semeval 2015 Task 15, aimed at producing a system that can aid lexicographers in their efforts to build a dictionary of meanings for English verbs using the CPA annotation process. CPA parsing is one of the subtasks which this annotation process is made of and it is the focus of this report. A supervised machine-learning approach has been implemented, in which syntactic features derived from parse trees and semantic features derived from WordNet and word embeddings are used. It is shown that this approach performs well, even with the data sparsity issues that characterize the dataset, and can obtain better results than other system by a margin of about 4% f-score.

语料库模式分析（CPA）是Semeval 2015 Task 15的主题，其目的在于建立一个系统，帮助词典编纂者使用CPA注释过程为英语动词构建词典。 CPA解析是这个注释过程的子任务之一，也是本报告的重点。已经实施了有监督的机器学习方法，其中使用从分析树和从WordNet导出的语义特征和词嵌入导出的句法特征。结果表明，这种方法即使在表征数据集的数据稀疏性问题上也表现良好，并且可以获得比其他系统更好的结果，f-score约为4％。
