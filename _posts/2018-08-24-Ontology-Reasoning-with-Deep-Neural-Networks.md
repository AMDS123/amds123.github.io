##### Abstract
The ability to conduct logical reasoning is a fundamental aspect of intelligent behavior, and thus an important problem along the way to human-level artificial intelligence. Traditionally, symbolic methods from the field of knowledge representation and reasoning have been used to equip agents with capabilities that resemble human reasoning qualities. More recently, however, there has been an increasing interest in applying alternative approaches based on machine learning rather than logic-based formalisms to tackle this kind of tasks. Here, we make use of state-of-the-art methods for training deep neural networks to devise a novel model that is closely coupled to symbolic reasoning methods, and thus able to learn how to effectively perform basic ontology reasoning. This term describes an important and at the same time very natural kind of problem settings where the rules for conducting reasoning are specified alongside with the actual information. Many problems in practice may be viewed as such reasoning tasks, which is why the presented approach is applicable to a plethora of important real-world problems. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the suggested method, we present the outcomes of several experiments that have been conducted on both toy datasets as well as real-world data, which show that our model learned to perform precise reasoning on a number of diverse inference tasks that require comprehensive deductive proficiencies. Furthermore, it turned out that the suggested model suffers much less from different obstacles that prohibit symbolic reasoning.

进行逻辑推理的能力是智能行为的一个基本方面，因此是人类人工智能的重要问题。传统上，来自知识表示和推理领域的符号方法已被用于使代理具有类似于人类推理质量的能力。然而，最近，人们越来越关注应用基于机器学习的替代方法而不是基于逻辑的形式来解决这类任务。在这里，我们利用最先进的方法训练深度神经网络，以设计一种与符号推理方法紧密结合的新模型，从而能够学习如何有效地执行基本的本体推理。该术语描述了一种重要且同时非常自然的问题设置，其中进行推理的规则与实际信息一起指定。实践中的许多问题可以被视为这样的推理任务，这就是为什么所提出的方法适用于过多重要的现实问题。为了证明所提方法的有效性，我们提出了对玩具数据集和实际数据进行的几个实验的结果，这些实验表明我们的模型学会了对许多不同的推理任务进行精确推理。需要全面的演绎能力。此外，事实证明，建议的模型从禁止符号推理的不同障碍中受到的影响要小得多。
