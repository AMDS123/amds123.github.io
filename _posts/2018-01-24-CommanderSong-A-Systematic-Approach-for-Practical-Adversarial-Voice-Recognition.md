##### Abstract
ASR (automatic speech recognition) systems like Siri, Alexa, Google Voice or Cortana has become quite popular recently. One of the key techniques enabling the practical use of such systems in people's daily life is deep learning. Though deep learning in computer vision is known to be vulnerable to adversarial perturbations, little is known whether such perturbations are still valid on the practical speech recognition. In this paper, we not only demonstrate such attacks can happen in reality, but also show that the attacks can be systematically conducted. To minimize users' attention, we choose to embed the voice commands into a song, called CommandSong. In this way, the song carrying the command can spread through radio, TV or even any media player installed in the portable devices like smartphones, potentially impacting millions of users in long distance. In particular, we overcome two major challenges: minimizing the revision of a song in the process of embedding commands, and letting the CommandSong spread through the air without losing the voice "command". Our evaluation demonstrates that we can craft random songs to "carry" any commands and the modify is extremely difficult to be noticed. Specially, the physical attack that we play the CommandSongs over the air and record them can success with 94 percentage.

Siri，Alexa，Google Voice或Cortana等ASR（自动语音识别）系统最近变得非常流行。使这种系统在人们日常生活中得到实际应用的关键技术之一就是深度学习。虽然已知计算机视觉深度学习容易受到对抗性干扰，但是对这种干扰在实际语音识别中是否仍然有效尚不清楚。在这篇论文中，我们不仅证明了这种攻击可以在现实中发生，而且也表明攻击可以系统地进行。为了最大限度地减少用户的注意力，我们选择将语音命令嵌入到名为CommandSong的歌曲中。这样，携带命令的歌曲就可以通过广播，电视甚至任何安装在智能手机等便携式设备上的媒体播放器进行传播，从而可能影响数百万用户的长距离传输。特别是，我们克服了两个主要的挑战：在嵌入命令的过程中最大限度地减少歌曲的修改，让CommandSong通过空中传播，而不会失去语音“命令”。我们的评估表明，我们可以制作随机歌曲“携带”任何命令，修改是非常难以注意的。特别的是，我们在空中弹奏CommandSongs并进行录制的物理攻击可以成功达到94％。
