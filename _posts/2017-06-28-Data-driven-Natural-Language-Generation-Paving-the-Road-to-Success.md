##### Abstract
We argue that there are currently two major bottlenecks to the commercial use of statistical machine learning approaches for natural language generation (NLG): (a) The lack of reliable automatic evaluation metrics for NLG, and (b) The scarcity of high quality in-domain corpora. We address the first problem by thoroughly analysing current evaluation metrics and motivating the need for a new, more reliable metric. The second problem is addressed by presenting a novel framework for developing and evaluating a high quality corpus for NLG training.

我们认为目前商用自然语言生成（NLG）统计机器学习方法存在两大瓶颈：（1）NLG缺乏可靠的自动评估指标;（2）缺乏高质量，领域语料库。我们通过彻底分析当前的评估指标来解决第一个问题，并激发对更可靠的新指标的需求。第二个问题是通过提出一个新的框架来开发和评估高质量的NLG训练语料库。
