##### Abstract
A novel hierarchical model is introduced to solve a general problem of detecting groups of similar objects. Under this model, detection of groups is performed in hierarchically organized layers while each layer represents a scope for target objects. The processing of these layers involves sequential extraction of appearance features for an individual object, consistency measurement features for nearby objects, and finally the distribution features for all objects within the group. Using the concept of scope-based normalization, the extracted features not only enhance local contrast of an individual object, but also provide consistent characterization for all related objects. As an example, a microcalcification group detection system for 2D mammography was developed, and then the learned model was transferred to 3D digital breast tomosynthesis without any retraining or fine-tuning. The detection system demonstrated state-of-the-art performance and detected 96% of cancerous lesions at the rate of 1.2 false positives per volume as measured on an independent tomosynthesis test set.

引入了一种新的分层模型来解决检测类似对象组的一般问题。在这个模型下，组的检测是在分层组织的层中执行的，而每个层代表目标对象的范围。这些图层的处理包括顺序提取单个对象的外观特征，附近对象的一致性测量特征以及组内所有对象的分布特征。使用基于范围的归一化概念，提取的特征不仅增强了单个对象的局部对比度，而且为所有相关对象提供了一致的特征。作为一个例子，二维乳腺X线摄影术的微钙化组检测系统被开发出来，然后学习的模型被转移到3D数字乳腺X射线断层摄影术，而无需任何再培训或微调。检测系统展现了最先进的性能，并且以独立的层析X射线照相组合测定的每体积1.2个假阳性的比率检测到96％的癌性病变。
