##### Abstract
Robots are widely collaborating with human users in diferent tasks that require high-level cognitive functions to make them able to discover the surrounding environment. A difcult challenge that we briefy highlight in this short paper is inferring the latent grammatical structure of language, which includes grounding parts of speech (e.g., verbs, nouns, adjectives, and prepositions) through visual perception, and induction of Combinatory Categorial Grammar (CCG) for phrases. This paves the way towards grounding phrases so as to make a robot able to understand human instructions appropriately during interaction.
