##### Abstract
In this paper, we propose a new control framework called the moving endpoint control to restore images corrupted by different degradation levels in one model. The proposed control problem contains a restoration dynamics which is modeled by an RNN. The moving endpoint, which is essentially the terminal time of the associated dynamics, is determined by a policy network. We call the proposed model the dynamically unfolding recurrent restorer (DURR). Numerical experiments show that DURR is able to achieve state-of-the-art performances on blind image denoising and JPEG image deblocking. Furthermore, DURR can well generalize to images with higher degradation levels that are not included in the training stage.

在本文中，我们提出了一种称为移动端点控制的新控制框架来恢复一个模型中由不同退化级别损坏的图像。所提出的控制问题包含由RNN模拟的恢复动力学。移动端点基本上是相关动态的终端时间，由策略网络决定。我们将所提出的模型称为动态展开循环恢复器（DURR）。数值实验表明，DURR能够实现盲图像去噪和JPEG图像去块的最新性能。此外，DURR可以很好地推广到训练阶段未包含的具有更高劣化等级的图像。
