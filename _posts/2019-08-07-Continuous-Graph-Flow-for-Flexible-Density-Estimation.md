##### Abstract
In this paper, we propose Continuous Graph Flow, a generative continuous flow based method that aims to model distributions of graph-structured complex data. The model is formulated as an ordinary differential equation system with shared and reusable functions that operate over the graph structure. This leads to a new type of neural graph message passing scheme that performs continuous message passing over time. This class of models offer several advantages: (1) modeling complex graphical distributions without rigid assumptions on the distributions; (2) not limited to modeling data of fixed dimensions and can generalize probability evaluation and data generation over unseen subset of variables; (3) the underlying continuous graph message passing process is reversible and memory-efficient. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our model on two generation tasks, namely, image puzzle generation, and layout generation from scene graphs. Compared to unstructured and structured latent-space VAE models, we show that our proposed model achieves significant performance improvement (up to 400% in negative log-likelihood).
