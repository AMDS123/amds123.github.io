##### Abstract
Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is achieving remarkable progress in various computer vision tasks. In the past few years, the remote sensing community has observed Deep Neural Network (DNN) finally taking off in several challenging fields. In this study, we propose a DNN to generate a predefined High Resolution (HR) synthetic spectral band using an ensemble of concurrent Low Resolution (LR) bands and existing HR bands. Of particular interest, the proposed network, namely DeepSWIR, synthesizes Short-Wave InfraRed (SWIR) band at 5m Ground Sampling Distance (GSD) using Green (G), Red (R) and Near InfraRed (NIR) bands at both 24m and 5m GSD, and SWIR band at 24m GSD. To our knowledge, the highest spatial resolution of commercially deliverable SWIR band is at 7.5m GSD. Also, we propose a Gaussian feathering based image stitching approach in light of processing large satellite imagery. To experimentally validate the synthesized HR SWIR band, we critically analyse the qualitative and quantitative results produced by DeepSWIR using state-of-the-art evaluation metrics. Further, we convert the synthesized DN values to Top Of Atmosphere (TOA) reflectance and compare with the corresponding band of Sentinel-2B. Finally, we show one real world application of the synthesized band by using it to map wetland resources over our region of interest.
