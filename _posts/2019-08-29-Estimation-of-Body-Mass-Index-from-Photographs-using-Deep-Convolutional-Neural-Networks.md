##### Abstract
Obesity is an important concern in public health, and Body Mass Index is one of the useful (and proliferant) measures. We use Convolutional Neural Networks to determine Body Mass Index from photographs in a study with 161 participants. Low data, a common problem in medicine, is addressed by reducing the information in the photographs by generating silhouette images. Results present with high correlation when tested on unseen data.
