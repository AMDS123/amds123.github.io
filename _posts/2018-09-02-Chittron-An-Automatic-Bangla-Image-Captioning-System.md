##### Abstract
Automatic image caption generation aims to produce an accurate description of an image in natural language automatically. However, Bangla, the fifth most widely spoken language in the world, is lagging considerably in the research and development of such domain. Besides, while there are many established data sets to related to image annotation in English, no such resource exists for Bangla yet. Hence, this paper outlines the development of "Chittron", an automatic image captioning system in Bangla. Moreover, to address the data set availability issue, a collection of 16,000 Bangladeshi contextual images has been accumulated and manually annotated in Bangla. This data set is then used to train a model which integrates a pre-trained VGG16 image embedding model with stacked LSTM layers. The model is trained to predict the caption when the input is an image, one word at a time. The results show that the model has successfully been able to learn a working language model and to generate captions of images quite accurately in many cases. The results are evaluated mainly qualitatively. However, BLEU scores are also reported. It is expected that a better result can be obtained with a bigger and more varied data set.

自动图像标题生成旨在自动生成自然语言的图像的准确描述。然而，孟加拉语是世界上使用最广泛的第五语言，在这一领域的研究和开发方面远远落后。此外，虽然有许多与英语图像标注相关的既定数据集，但孟加拉还没有这样的资源。因此，本文概述了孟加拉自动图像字幕系统“Chittron”的发展。此外，为解决数据集可用性问题，孟加拉共收集了16,000个孟加拉国背景图像并手动注释。然后，该数据集用于训练模型，该模型将预训练的VGG16图像嵌入模型与堆叠的LSTM层集成。训练该模型以在输入是图像时预测字幕，一次一个字。结果表明，该模型已经成功地学习了一种工作语言模型，并且在很多情况下可以非常准确地生成图像的标题。结果主要是定性评估。但是，也报道了BLEU分数。预计使用更大且更多样化的数据集可以获得更好的结果。
