##### Abstract
Increased interest of scientists, producers and consumers in sheep identification has been stimulated by the dramatic increase in population and the urge to increase productivity. The world population is expected to exceed 9.6 million in 2050. For this reason, awareness is raised towards the necessity of effective livestock production. Sheep is considered as one of the main of food resources. Most of the research now is directed towards developing real time applications that facilitate sheep identification for breed management and gathering related information like weight and age. Weight and age are key matrices in assessing the effectiveness of production. For this reason, visual analysis proved recently its significant success over other approaches. Visual analysis techniques need enough images for testing and study completion. For this reason, collecting sheep images database is a vital step to fulfill such objective. We provide here datasets for testing and comparing such algorithms which are under development. Our collected dataset consists of 416 color images for different features of sheep in different postures. Images were collected fifty two sheep at a range of year from three months to six years. For each sheep, two images were captured for both sides of the body, two images for both sides of the face, one image from the top view, one image for the hip and one image for the teeth. The collected images cover different illumination, quality levels and angle of rotation. The allocated data set can be used to test sheep identification, weigh estimation, and age detection algorithms. Such algorithms are crucial for disease management, animal assessment and ownership.

科学家，生产者和消费者对羊鉴定的兴趣日益增加，人口急剧增加和提高生产力的愿望激起了人们的兴趣。到2050年，世界人口预计将超过960万。因此，人们意识到有效畜牧生产的必要性。绵羊被认为是食物资源的主要来源之一。现在大部分的研究都是针对开发实时应用程序，这些应用程序有助于羊品种管理的识别和收集相关信息，如体重和年龄。体重和年龄是评估生产效率的关键矩阵。出于这个原因，视觉分析最近证明了它在其他方法上的显着成功。视觉分析技术需要足够的图像进行测试和研究完成。因此，收集绵羊图像数据库是实现这一目标的关键一步。我们在这里提供用于测试和比较正在开发的这些算法的数据集。我们收集的数据集包含416张不同姿势绵羊不同特征的彩色图像。从三个月到六年的时间范围收集了五十二只羊的图像。对于每只绵羊，身体两侧拍摄两张图像，两张脸部图像，一张顶部视图，一张臀部图像和一张牙齿图像。收集的图像涵盖不同的照明，质量水平和旋转角度。分配的数据集可用于测试绵羊识别，权重估计和年龄检测算法。这些算法对于疾病管理，动物评估和所有权至关重要。
