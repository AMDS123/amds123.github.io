##### Abstract
In the last several years, the field of computer assisted language learning has increasingly focused on computer aided question generation. However, this approach often provides test takers with an exhaustive amount of questions that are not designed for any specific testing purpose. In this work, we present a personalized computer aided question generation that generates multiple choice questions at various difficulty levels and types, including vocabulary, grammar and reading comprehension. In order to improve the weaknesses of test takers, it selects questions depending on an estimated proficiency level and unclear concepts behind incorrect responses. This results show that the students with the personalized automatic quiz generation corrected their mistakes more frequently than ones only with computer aided question generation. Moreover, students demonstrated the most progress between the pretest and post test and correctly answered more difficult questions. Finally, we investigated the personalizing strategy and found that a student could make a significant progress if the proposed system offered the vocabulary questions at the same level of his or her proficiency level, and if the grammar and reading comprehension questions were at a level lower than his or her proficiency level.

在过去几年中，计算机辅助语言学习领域越来越关注计算机辅助问题的产生。但是，这种方法通常会为测试者提供大量的问题，这些问题不是为任何特定的测试目的而设计的。在这项工作中，我们提出了一个个性化的计算机辅助问题生成，它可以生成各种难度级别和类型的多项选择题，包括词汇，语法和阅读理解。为了改善考生的弱点，它会根据估计的熟练程度和不正确的答案背后不明确的概念来选择问题。这一结果表明，具有个性化自动测验生成的学生比仅使用计算机辅助问题生成的学生更频繁地纠正他们的错误。此外，学生在预测试和后测试之间表现出最大的进步，并正确回答了更难的问题。最后，我们研究了个性化策略，发现如果所提出的系统在他或她的熟练程度相同的水平上提供词汇问题，并且如果语法和阅读理解问题的水平低于其水平，则学生可以取得重大进展。他或她的熟练程度。
