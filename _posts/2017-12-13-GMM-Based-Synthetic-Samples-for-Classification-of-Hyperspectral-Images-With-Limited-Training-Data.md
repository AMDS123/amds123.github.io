##### Abstract
The amount of training data that is required to train a classifier scales with the dimensionality of the feature data. In hyperspectral remote sensing, feature data can potentially become very high dimensional. However, the amount of training data is oftentimes limited. Thus, one of the core challenges in hyperspectral remote sensing is how to perform multi-class classification using only relatively few training data points. 
 In this work, we address this issue by enriching the feature matrix with synthetically generated sample points. This synthetic data is sampled from a GMM fitted to each class of the limited training data. Although, the true distribution of features may not be perfectly modeled by the fitted GMM, we demonstrate that a moderate augmentation by these synthetic samples can effectively replace a part of the missing training samples. We show the efficacy of the proposed approach on two hyperspectral datasets. The median gain in classification performance is $5\%$. It is also encouraging that this performance gain is remarkably stable for large variations in the number of added samples, which makes it much easier to apply this method to real-world applications.

训练分类器所需的训练数据量随着特征数据的维数而变化。在高光谱遥感中，特征数据可能变得非常高。但是，训练数据量往往是有限的。因此，高光谱遥感的核心挑战之一是如何利用相对较少的训练数据点进行多类分类。
 在这项工作中，我们通过用合成生成的采样点丰富特征矩阵来解决这个问题。这个合成数据是从适合于每一类有限训练数据的GMM中采样的。虽然，特征的真实分布可能不是完美的拟合GMM模型，我们证明这些合成样本适度增加可以有效地取代一部分缺失的训练样本。我们在两个高光谱数据集上展示了这种方法的有效性。分类性能的中值增益是$ 5 \％$。同样令人鼓舞的是，由于样本数量的巨大变化，这种性能增益非常稳定，这使得将这种方法应用于实际应用变得更加容易。
