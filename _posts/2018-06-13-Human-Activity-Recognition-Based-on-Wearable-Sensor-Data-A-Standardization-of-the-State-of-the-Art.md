##### Abstract
Human activity recognition based on wearable sensor data has been an attractive research topic due to its application in areas such as healthcare, homeland security and smart environments. In this context, many works have presented remarkable results using accelerometer, gyroscope and magnetometer data to represent the categories of activities. However, the current studies do not consider important issues that lead to skewed results, making hard to measure how well sensor-based human activity recognition is and preventing a direct comparison of previous works. These issues include the employed metrics, the validation protocol used, the samples generation process, and the quality of the dataset (i.e., the sampling rate and the number of activities to be recognized). We emphasize that in other research areas, such as image classification and object detection, these issues are well-defined, which brings more efforts towards the application. Inspired by this, in this work, we conduct an extensive set of experiments to indicate the vulnerable points in human activity recognition based on wearable sensor data. To this purpose, we implement and evaluate several state-of-the-art approaches, ranging from handcrafted-based methods to convolutional neural networks. Furthermore, we standardize a large number of datasets, which vary in terms of sampling rate, number of sensors, activities and subjects. According to our study, the most of evaluation types applied in the literature are not adequate to perform the activity recognition in the context of wearable sensor data, in which the recognition accuracy drops around ten percentage points when compared to the appropriate validation.

基于可穿戴传感器数据的人类活动识别由于其在医疗保健，国土安全和智能环境等领域的应用而成为一个具有吸引力的研究课题。在这种情况下，许多作品使用加速度计，陀螺仪和磁力计数据来表示活动类别，取得了显着成果。然而，目前的研究并没有考虑导致结果偏差的重要问题，难以衡量基于传感器的人类活动识别效果如何，并妨碍了对以前作品的直接比较。这些问题包括采用的度量标准，使用的验证协议，样本生成过程以及数据集的质量（即采样率和要识别的活动数量）。我们强调，在其他研究领域，例如图像分类和对象检测，这些问题都有明确的定义，为应用程序带来更多的努力。受此启发，在这项工作中，我们进行了一系列广泛的实验，以指出基于可穿戴传感器数据的人类活动识别中的脆弱点。为此，我们实施并评估了几种最先进的方法，从基于手工的方法到卷积神经网络。此外，我们标准化了大量数据集，这些数据集在采样率，传感器数量，活动和主题方面各不相同。根据我们的研究，文献中应用的大多数评估类型不足以在可穿戴传感器数据的情况下执行活动识别，其中与适当的验证相比，识别准确性下降约10个百分点。
