##### Abstract
To image in high resolution large and occlusion-prone scenes, a camera must move above and around. Degradation of visibility due to geometric occlusions and distances is exacerbated by scattering, when the scene is in a participating medium. Moreover, underwater and in other media, artificial lighting is needed. Overall, data quality depends on the observed surface, medium and the time-varying poses of the camera and light source. This work proposes to optimize camera/light poses as they move, so that the surface is scanned efficiently and the descattered recovery has the highest quality. The work generalizes the next best view concept of robot vision to scattering media and cooperative movable lighting. It also extends descattering to platforms that move optimally. The optimization criterion is information gain, taken from information theory. We exploit the existence of a prior rough 3D model, since underwater such a model is routinely obtained using sonar. We demonstrate this principle in a scaled-down setup.

要在高分辨率的大型和容易遮挡的场景中进行成像，摄像机必须在上方和周围移动。当场景在参与媒体中时，由于几何遮挡和距离导致的能见度降级被散射加剧。而且，在水下和其他媒体中，需要人造照明。总体而言，数据质量取决于观察到的表面，中等以及相机和光源的时变姿势。这项工作提出优化相机/光的姿势，因为它们的移动，使表面被有效地扫描和descattered恢复具有最高的质量。这项工作将机器人视觉的下一个最佳视图概念推广到散射介质和协作可移动照明。它也将descattering扩展到最佳移动的平台。优化准则是信息增益，取自信息论。我们利用先前的粗糙三维模型的存在，因为水下这样的模型通常使用声纳获得。我们在缩小的设置中演示这个原则。
