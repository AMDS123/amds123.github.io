##### Abstract
When we watch a video, in which human hands manipulate objects, these hands may obscure some parts of those objects. We are willing to make clear how the objects are manipulated by making the image of hands semi-transparent, and showing the complete images of the hands and the object. By carefully choosing a Half-Diminished Reality method, this paper proposes a method that can process the video in real time and verifies that the proposed method works well.

当我们观看一个人手操纵物体的视频时，这些手可能会掩盖这些物体的某些部分。我们愿意通过使手的图像变得半透明，并且显示手和物体的完整图像来明确如何操纵物体。本文通过仔细选择半衰减现实方法，提出了一种实时处理视频的方法，验证了该方法的正确性。
