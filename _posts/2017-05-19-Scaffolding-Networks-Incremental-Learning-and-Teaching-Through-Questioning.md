##### Abstract
We introduce a new paradigm of learning for reasoning, understanding, and prediction, as well as the scaffolding network to implement this paradigm. The scaffolding network embodies an incremental learning approach that is formulated as a teacher-student network architecture to teach machines how to understand text and do reasoning. The key to our computational scaffolding approach is the interactions between the teacher and the student through sequential questioning. The student observes each sentence in the text incrementally, and it uses an attention-based neural net to discover and register the key information in relation to its current memory. Meanwhile, the teacher asks questions about the observed text, and the student network gets rewarded by correctly answering these questions. The entire network is updated continually using reinforcement learning. Our experimental results on synthetic and real datasets show that the scaffolding network not only outperforms state-of-the-art methods but also learns to do reasoning in a scalable way even with little human generated input.

我们引入一个新的学习范式，用于推理，理解和预测，还有脚手架网络来实现这个范式。脚手架网络体现了一种渐进式的学习方法，被制定为师生网络架构，教机器如何理解文本和做推理。我们的计算脚手架方法的关键是通过顺序提问，老师和学生之间的互动。学生逐渐观察文本中的每个句子，并使用基于注意的神经网络来发现和记录与其当前记忆有关的关键信息。同时老师对所观察到的文字提出质疑，正确回答这些问题，学生网络得到回报。整个网络使用强化学习不断更新。我们在合成和真实数据集上的实验结果表明，脚手架网络不仅胜过最先进的方法，而且还学习以可扩展的方式进行推理，即使人为输入也很少。
