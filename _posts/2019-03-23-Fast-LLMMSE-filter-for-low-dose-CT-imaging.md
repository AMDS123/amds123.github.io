##### Abstract
Low-dose X-ray CT technology is one of important directions of current research and development of medical imaging equipment. A fast algorithm of blockwise sinogram filtering is presented for realtime low-dose CT imaging. A nonstationary Gaussian noise model of low-dose sinogram data is proposed in the low-mA (tube current) CT protocol. Then, according to the linear minimum mean square error principle, an adaptive blockwise algorithm is built to filter contaminated sinogram data caused by photon starvation. A moving sum technique is used to speed the algorithm into a linear time one, regardless of the block size and thedata range. The proposedfast filtering givesa better performance in noise reduction and detail preservation in the reconstructed images,which is verified in experiments on simulated and real data compared with some related filtering methods.
