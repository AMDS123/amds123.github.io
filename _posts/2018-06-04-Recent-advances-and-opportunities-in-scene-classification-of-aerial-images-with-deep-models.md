##### Abstract
Scene classification is a fundamental task in interpretation of remote sensing images, and has become an active research topic in remote sensing community due to its important role in a wide range of applications. Over the past years, tremendous efforts have been made for developing powerful approaches for scene classification of remote sensing images, evolving from the traditional bag-of-visual-words model to the new generation deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs). The deep CNN based methods have exhibited remarkable breakthrough on performance, dramatically outperforming previous methods which strongly rely on hand-crafted features. However, performance with deep CNNs has gradually plateaued on existing public scene datasets, due to the notable drawbacks of these datasets, such as the small scale and low-diversity of training samples. Therefore, to promote the development of new methods and move the scene classification task a step further, we deeply discuss the existing problems in scene classification task, and accordingly present three open directions. We believe these potential directions will be instructive for the researchers in this field.

场景分类是遥感图像解译的基础任务，由于其在广泛的应用中起着重要作用，已成为遥感领域的一个活跃的研究课题。在过去的几年中，为开发遥感影像场景分类的强大方法，从传统的视觉词语模型演变为新一代深度卷积神经网络（CNN），已经做出了巨大努力。基于CNN的深度方法在性能上展现出了显着的突破，大大超越了以前强烈依赖手工特征的方法。然而，由于这些数据集的显着缺点，例如训练样本的小规模和低多样性，深度CNN的性能已经在现有的公共场景数据集上逐渐稳定。因此，为了推动新方法的发展和将场景分类任务进一步推进，我们深入探讨了场景分类任务中存在的问题，并据此提出了三个开放的方向。我们相信这些潜在的方向将对该领域的研究人员有指导意义。
