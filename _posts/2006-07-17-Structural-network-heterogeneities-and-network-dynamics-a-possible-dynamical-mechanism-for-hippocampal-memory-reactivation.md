##### Abstract
The hippocampus has the capacity for reactivating recently acquired memories [1-3] and it is hypothesized that one of the functions of sleep reactivation is the facilitation of consolidation of novel memory traces [4-11]. The dynamic and network processes underlying such a reactivation remain, however, unknown. We show that such a reactivation characterized by local, self-sustained activity of a network region may be an inherent property of the recurrent excitatory-inhibitory network with a heterogeneous structure. The entry into the reactivation phase is mediated through a physiologically feasible regulation of global excitability and external input sources, while the reactivated component of the network is formed through induced network heterogeneities during learning. We show that structural changes needed for robust reactivation of a given network region are well within known physiological parameters [12,13].

海马有能力重新激活最近获得的记忆[1-3]，并假设睡眠重新激活的功能之一是促进新的记忆痕迹的巩固[4-11]。然而，这种重新激活的动态和网络过程依然是未知的。我们表明，这种以局部，自我维持的网络区域活动为特征的再活化可能是具有异质结构的反复兴奋抑制网络的固有属性。进入再激活阶段的过程是通过对全局兴奋性和外部输入源的生理可行调节来调节的，而网络的再激活成分是通过学习过程中诱发的网络异质性形成的。我们表明，强大的激活一个给定的网络区域所需的结构变化，已知的生理参数范围内[12,13]。
