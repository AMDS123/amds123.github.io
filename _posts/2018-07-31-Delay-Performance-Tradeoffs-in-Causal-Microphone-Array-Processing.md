##### Abstract
In real-time listening enhancement applications, such as hearing aid signal processing, sounds must be processed with no more than a few milliseconds of delay to sound natural to the listener. Listening devices can achieve better performance with lower delay by using microphone arrays to filter acoustic signals in both space and time. Here, we analyze the tradeoff between delay and squared-error performance of causal multichannel Wiener filters for microphone array noise reduction. We compute exact expressions for the delay-error curves in two special cases and present experimental results from real-world microphone array recordings. We find that delay-performance characteristics are determined by both the spatial and temporal correlation structures of the signals.

在诸如助听器信号处理之类的实时收听增强应用中，必须以不超过几毫秒的延迟处理声音以使听众听起来自然。通过使用麦克风阵列在空间和时间中过滤声学信号，收听设备可以通过更低的延迟实现更好的性能。在这里，我们分析了用于麦克风阵列降噪的因果多通道维纳滤波器的延迟和平方误差性能之间的权衡。我们在两种特殊情况下计算延迟误差曲线的精确表达式，并提供实际麦克风阵列记录的实验结果。我们发现延迟 - 性能特性由信号的空间和时间相关结构决定。
