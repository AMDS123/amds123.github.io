##### Abstract
Biometric identification systems have become immensely popular and important because of their high reliability and efficiency. However person identification at a distance, still remains a challenging problem. Gait can be seen as an essential biometric feature for human recognition and identification. It can be easily acquired from a distance and does not require any user cooperation thus making it suitable for surveillance. But the task of recognizing an individual using gait can be adversely affected by varying view points making this task more and more challenging. Our proposed approach tackles this problem by identifying spatio-temporal features and performing extensive experimentation and training mechanism. In this paper, we propose a 3-D Convolution Deep Neural Network for person identification using gait under multiple view. It is a 2-stage network, in which we have a classification network that initially identifies the viewing point angle. After that another set of networks (one for each angle) has been trained to identify the person under a particular viewing angle. We have tested this network over CASIA-B publicly available database and have achieved state-of-the-art results. The proposed system is much more efficient in terms of time and space and performing better for almost all angles.

生物识别系统由于其高可靠性和高效率而变得非常流行和重要。然而，远程识别人员仍然是一个具有挑战性的问题。步态可以被看作是人类识别和识别的基本生物特征。它可以很容易地从远处获得，不需要任何用户协作，因此适合监视。但是，使用步态来识别个体的任务会受到不同观点的不利影响，使得这一任务变得越来越具有挑战性。我们提出的方法通过识别时空特征和执行广泛的实验和训练机制来解决这个问题。在本文中，我们提出了一种三维卷积深度神经网络，用于在多视图下使用步态进行人员识别。这是一个两阶段的网络，我们有一个分类网络，最初确定视角的角度。之后，另一组网络（每个角度一个网络）已经被训练成在特定视角下识别该人。我们已经通过CASIA-B公开可用的数据库测试了这个网络，并取得了最先进的成果。所提出的系统在时间和空间方面效率更高，在几乎所有角度上都表现更好。
