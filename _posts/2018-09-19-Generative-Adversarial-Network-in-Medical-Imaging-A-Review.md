##### Abstract
Generative adversarial networks have gained a lot of attention in general computer vision community due to their capability of data generation without explicitly modelling the probability density function and robustness to overfitting. The adversarial loss brought by the discriminator provides a clever way of incorporating unlabeled samples into the training and imposing higher order consistency that is proven to be useful in many cases, such as in domain adaptation, data augmentation, and image-to-image translation. These nice properties have attracted researcher in the medical imaging community and we have seen quick adoptions in many traditional tasks and some novel applications. This trend will continue to grow based on our observation, therefore we conducted a review of the recent advances in medical imaging using the adversarial training scheme in the hope of benefiting researchers that are interested in this technique.

生成对抗网络由于其数据生成能力而在没有明确建模概率密度函数和过度拟合的鲁棒性的情况下在一般计算机视觉社区中获得了很多关注。鉴别器带来的对抗性损失提供了一种巧妙的方法，可以将未标记的样本纳入训练并实现更高阶的一致性，这在许多情况下被证明是有用的，例如在域适应，数据增强和图像到图像转换中。这些不错的属性吸引了医学成像界的研究人员，我们已经看到许多传统任务和一些新颖的应用程序的快速采用。基于我们的观察，这种趋势将继续增长，因此我们使用对抗性训练计划对医学成像的最新进展进行了回顾，希望能够使对该技术感兴趣的研究人员受益。
