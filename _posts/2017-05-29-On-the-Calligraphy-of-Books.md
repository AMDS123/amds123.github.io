##### Abstract
Authorship attribution is a natural language processing task that has been widely studied, often by considering small order statistics. In this paper, we explore a complex network approach to assign the authorship of texts based on their mesoscopic representation, in an attempt to capture the flow of the narrative. Indeed, as reported in this work, such an approach allowed the identification of the dominant narrative structure of the studied authors. This has been achieved due to the ability of the mesoscopic approach to take into account relationships between different, not necessarily adjacent, parts of the text, which is able to capture the story flow. The potential of the proposed approach has been illustrated through principal component analysis, a comparison with the chance baseline method, and network visualization. Such visualizations reveal individual characteristics of the authors, which can be understood as a kind of calligraphy.

作者归属是一项自然语言处理任务，经常通过考虑小订单统计被广泛研究。在本文中，我们探索了一个复杂的网络方法来指定基于其介观表示的文本的作者，试图捕捉叙事流程。事实上，正如在这项工作中所报告的那样，这种方法可以确定被研究作者的主导叙事结构。这已经实现了，因为介观方法的能力考虑了能够捕捉故事流程的文本的不同部分（不一定相邻）之间的关系。所提出的方法的潜力已经通过主成分分析，与机会基线方法的比较以及网络可视化来说明。这种可视化揭示了作者个人的特点，可以理解为一种书法。
