##### Abstract
Nowadays, big effort is being put to study gamification and how game elements can be used to engage players. In this scope, we believe there is a growing need to explore the impact game mechanics have on the players' interactions and perception. This work focuses on the application of game mechanics to lead players to achieve certain types of social interaction (we named this type of mechanics social interaction mechanics). A word matching game called CrossAnt was modified so that it could dynamically generate different social interaction mechanics. These mechanics consisted in different key combinations needed to play the game and were aimed to promote what we think are three important types of social interactions: cooperation, competition and individual exploration. Our evaluation consisted on the execution of several sessions where two players interacted with the game for several levels and had to find for themselves how to perform the actions needed to succeed. While some of the levels required the input from both players in order to be completed, others could be completed by each player independently. Our results show that cooperation was perceived when both players had to intervene to perform the game actions. However, longer interactions may still be needed so that the other types of interactions are promoted.
