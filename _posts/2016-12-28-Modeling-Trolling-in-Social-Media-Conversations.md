##### Abstract
Social media websites, electronic newspapers and Internet forums allow visitors to leave comments for others to read and interact. This exchange is not free from participants with malicious intentions, who troll others by positing messages that are intended to be provocative, offensive, or menacing. With the goal of facilitating the computational modeling of trolling, we propose a trolling categorization that is novel in the sense that it allows comment-based analysis from both the trolls' and the responders' perspectives, characterizing these two perspectives using four aspects, namely, the troll's intention and his intention disclosure, as well as the responder's interpretation of the troll's intention and her response strategy. Using this categorization, we annotate and release a dataset containing excerpts of Reddit conversations involving suspected trolls and their interactions with other users. Finally, we identify the difficult-to-classify cases in our corpus and suggest potential solutions for them.

社交媒体网站，电子报纸和互联网论坛允许访客留下评论供他人阅读和互动。这种交流并不是免于恶意的参与者，而是通过定位意图具有挑衅性，冒犯性或威胁性的信息来欺骗他人。为了促进对钓鱼的计算建模，我们提出了一个新颖的钓鱼分类方法，它允许从钓巨人和响应者的角度进行基于评论的分析，从四个方面来描述这两个方面：巨魔的意图和他的意图披露，以及响应者对巨魔意图和她的反应策略的解释。使用这个分类，我们注释并发布一个数据集，其中包含涉及可疑巨魔的Reddit对话摘录以及与其他用户的交互。最后，我们确定了我们语料库中难以归类的案例，并提出了可能的解决方案。
