##### Abstract
Memorability measures how easily an image is to be memorized after glancing, which may contribute to designing magazine covers, tourism publicity materials, and so forth. Recent works have shed light on the visual features that make generic images, object images or face photographs memorable. However, a clear understanding and reliable estimation of natural scene memorability remain elusive. In this paper, we provide an attempt to answer: "what exactly makes natural scene memorable". To this end, we first establish a large-scale natural scene image memorability (LNSIM) database, containing 2,632 natural scene images and their ground truth memorability scores. Then, we mine our database to investigate how low-, middle- and high-level handcrafted features affect the memorability of natural scene. In particular, we find that high-level feature of scene category is rather correlated with natural scene memorability. We also find that deep feature is effective in predicting the memorability scores. Therefore, we propose a deep neural network based natural scene memorability (DeepNSM) predictor, which takes advantage of scene category. Finally, the experimental results validate the effectiveness of our DeepNSM, exceeding the state-of-the-art methods.
