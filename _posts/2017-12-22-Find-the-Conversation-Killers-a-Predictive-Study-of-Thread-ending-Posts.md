##### Abstract
How to improve the quality of conversations in online communities has attracted considerable attention recently. Having engaged, urbane, and reactive online conversations has a critical effect on the social life of Internet users. In this study, we are particularly interested in identifying a post in a multi-party conversation that is unlikely to be further replied to, which therefore kills that thread of the conversation. For this purpose, we propose a deep learning model called the ConverNet. ConverNet is attractive due to its capability of modeling the internal structure of a long conversation and its appropriate encoding of the contextual information of the conversation, through effective integration of attention mechanisms. Empirical experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposal model. For the widely concerned topic, our analysis also offers implications for improving the quality and user experience of online conversations.

如何提高在线社区的对话质量，近来备受关注。参与，温文尔雅，被动的在线对话对互联网用户的社交生活有着至关重要的影响。在这项研究中，我们特别感兴趣的是在多方对话中找出一个不太可能被进一步回复的帖子，因此会导致对话的线索。为此，我们提出了一个名为ConverNet的深度学习模型。 ConverNet由于能够通过对关注机制的有效整合来模拟长谈话的内部结构以及对谈话语境信息的适当编码，因此具有吸引力。实际数据集的实证实验证明了提议模型的有效性。对于广泛关注的话题，我们的分析也提供了改善在线对话的质量和用户体验的含义。
