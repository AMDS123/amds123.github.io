##### Abstract
The development of models for learning music similarity and feature extraction from audio media files is an increasingly important task for the entertainment industry. This work proposes a novel music classification model based on metric learning and feature extraction from MP3 audio files. The metric learning process considers the learning of a set of parameterized distances employing a structured prediction approach from a set of MP3 audio files containing several music genres. The main objective of this work is to make possible learning a personalized metric for each customer. To extract the acoustic information we use the Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficient (MFCC) and make a dimensionality reduction with the use of Principal Components Analysis. We attest the model validity performing a set of experiments and comparing the training and testing results with baseline algorithms, such as K-means and Soft Margin Linear Support Vector Machine (SVM). Experiments show promising results and encourage the future development of an online version of the learning model.
