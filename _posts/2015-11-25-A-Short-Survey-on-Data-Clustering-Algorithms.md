##### Abstract
With rapidly increasing data, clustering algorithms are important tools for data analytics in modern research. They have been successfully applied to a wide range of domains; for instance, bioinformatics, speech recognition, and financial analysis. Formally speaking, given a set of data instances, a clustering algorithm is expected to divide the set of data instances into the subsets which maximize the intra-subset similarity and inter-subset dissimilarity, where a similarity measure is defined beforehand. In this work, the state-of-the-arts clustering algorithms are reviewed from design concept to methodology; Different clustering paradigms are discussed. Advanced clustering algorithms are also discussed. After that, the existing clustering evaluation metrics are reviewed. A summary with future insights is provided at the end.

##### Abstract (translated by Google)
随着数据的快速增长，聚类算法是现代研究中数据分析的重要工具。他们已经成功地应用于广泛的领域;例如生物信息学，语音识别和财务分析。从形式上讲，给定一组数据实例，聚类算法被期望将数据实例集合划分成最大化子集内相似性和子集间不相似性的子集，其中相似性度量被预先定义。在这项工作中，先进的聚类算法从设计概念到方法论进行审查;讨论了不同的聚类范例。还讨论了高级聚类算法。之后，审查现有的聚类评估指标。最后提供未来见解的总结。
