##### Abstract
In this study, we investigate how a robot can generate novel and creative actions from its own experience of learning basic actions. Inspired by a machine learning approach to computational creativity, we propose a dynamic neural network model that can learn and generate robot's actions. We conducted a set of simulation experiments with a humanoid robot. The results showed that the proposed model was able to learn the basic actions and also to generate novel actions by modulating and combining those learned actions. The analysis on the neural activities illustrated that the ability to generate creative actions emerged from the model's nonlinear memory structure self-organized during training. The results also showed that the different way of learning the basic actions induced the self-organization of the memory structure with the different characteristics, resulting in the generation of different levels of creative actions. Our approach can be utilized in human-robot interaction in which a user can interactively explore the robot's memory to control its behavior and also discover other novel actions.

在这项研究中，我们研究机器人如何从自己的学习基本行为的经验中产生新颖和创造性的行为。受机器学习方法启发的计算创造力的启发，我们提出了一个动态的神经网络模型，可以学习和生成机器人的动作。我们用仿人机器人进行了一系列仿真实验。结果表明，所提出的模型能够学习基本动作，并通过调整和组合这些学习动作来产生新颖的动作。对神经活动的分析表明，产生创造性行为的能力来自模型在训练期间自组织的非线性记忆结构。结果还表明，不同的基本行为学习方式导致了具有不同特征的记忆结构的自组织，导致产生不同层次的创造性行为。我们的方法可以用在人机交互中，用户可以通过交互探索机器人的记忆来控制其行为，还可以发现其他新颖的动作。
