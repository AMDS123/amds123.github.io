##### Abstract
Highly clumped nuclei clusters captured in fluorescence in situ hybridization microscopy images are common histology entities under investigations in a wide spectrum of tissue-related biomedical investigations. Due to their large scale in presence, computer based image analysis is used to facilitate such analysis with improved analysis efficiency and reproducibility. To ensure the quality of downstream biomedical analyses, it is essential to segment clustered nuclei with high quality. However, this presents a technical challenge commonly encountered in a large number of biomedical research, as nuclei are often overlapped due to a high cell density. In this paper, we propose an segmentation algorithm that identifies point pair connection candidates and evaluates adjacent point connections with a formulated ellipse fitting quality indicator. After connection relationships are determined, we recover the resulting dividing paths by following points with specific eigenvalues from Hessian in a constrained searching space. We validate our algorithm with 560 image patches from two classes of tumor regions of seven brain tumor patients. Both qualitative and quantitative experimental results suggest that our algorithm is promising for dividing overlapped nuclei in fluorescence in situ hybridization microscopy images widely used in various biomedical research.

在荧光原位杂交显微镜图像中捕获的高度聚集的核簇是在广泛的组织相关生物医学研究中进行研究的常见组织学实体。由于其存在的大规模，基于计算机的图像分析用于促进这种分析，具有改进的分析效率和再现性。为了确保下游生物医学分析的质量，必须以高质量分割成簇核。然而，这提出了在大量生物医学研究中经常遇到的技术挑战，因为细胞核通常由于高细胞密度而重叠。在本文中，我们提出了一种分割算法，该算法识别点对连接候选，并使用公式化的椭圆拟合质量指标评估相邻点连接。在确定连接关系之后，我们通过跟随具有来自约束搜索空间中的Hessian的特定特征值的点来恢复所得到的分割路径。我们使用来自七个脑肿瘤患者的两类肿瘤区域的560个图像块来验证我们的算法。定性和定量实验结果表明，我们的算法有望用于在各种生物医学研究中广泛使用的荧光原位杂交显微镜图像中分离重叠核。
