##### Abstract
Creative tasks such as ideation or question proposal are powerful applications of crowdsourcing, yet the quantity of workers available for addressing practical problems is often insufficient. To enable scalable crowdsourcing thus requires gaining all possible efficiency and information from available workers. One option for text-focused tasks is to allow assistive technology, such as an autocompletion user interface (AUI), to help workers input text responses. But support for the efficacy of AUIs is mixed. Here we designed and conducted a randomized experiment where workers were asked to provide short text responses to given questions. Our experimental goal was to determine if an AUI helps workers respond more quickly and with improved consistency by mitigating typos and misspellings. Surprisingly, we found that neither occurred: workers assigned to the AUI treatment were slower than those assigned to the non-AUI control and their responses were more diverse, not less, than those of the control. Both the lexical and semantic diversities of responses were higher, with the latter measured using word2vec. A crowdsourcer interested in worker speed may want to avoid using an AUI, but using an AUI to boost response diversity may be valuable to crowdsourcers interested in receiving as much novel information from workers as possible.

诸如构想或问题提议等创造性任务是众包的强大应用，但解决实际问题的工作人员数量往往不足。为了实现可扩展的众包，需要从现有的员工获得所有可能的效率和信息。针对文本的任务的一个选择是允许诸如自动完成用户界面（AUI）之类的辅助技术来帮助工作人员输入文本响应。但是对AUI功效的支持是混合的。在这里，我们设计并进行了一个随机实验，要求工作人员针对特定问题提供简短的文字回答。我们的实验目标是确定AUI是否可以帮助工作人员更快地做出反应，并通过减少拼写错误和拼写错误来提高一致性。令人惊讶的是，我们发现这两种情况都没有发生：分配到AUI处理的工人比分配给非AUI处理的工人要慢，他们的反应比对照组更为多样化。词汇和语义的多样性反应都较高，后者使用word2vec进行测量。对工作者速度感兴趣的众包供应商可能希望避免使用AUI，但是使用AUI来提高响应多样性对于有兴趣从工人接收尽可能多的新信息的众包供应商可能是有价值的。
