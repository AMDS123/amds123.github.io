##### Abstract
Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have gained a lot of popularity in diverse wireless communication fields. They can act as high-altitude flying relays to support communications between ground nodes due to their ability to provide line-of-sight links. With the flourishing Internet of Things, several types of new applications are emerging. In this paper, we focus on bandwidth hungry and delay-tolerant applications where multiple pairs of transceivers require the support of UAVs to complete their transmissions. To do so, the UAVs have the possibility to employ two different bands namely the typical microwave and the high-rate millimeter wave bands. In this paper, we develop a generic framework to assign UAVs to supported transceivers and optimize their trajectories such that a weighted function of the total service time is minimized. Taking into account both the communication time needed to relay the message and the flying time of the UAVs, a mixed non-linear programming problem aiming at finding the stops at which the UAVs hover to forward the data to the receivers is formulated. An iterative approach is then developed to solve the problem. First, a mixed linear programming problem is optimally solved to determine the path of each available UAV. Then, a hierarchical iterative search is executed to enhance the UAV stops' locations and reduce the service time. The behavior of the UAVs and the benefits of the proposed framework are showcased for selected scenarios.

无人驾驶飞行器（UAV）在各种无线通信领域中获得了很多普及。它们可以充当高空飞行继电器，以支持地面节点之间的通信，因为它们能够提供视线链路。随着物联网的蓬勃发展，出现了几种新的应用。在本文中，我们关注带宽饥饿和延迟容忍应用，其中多对收发器需要UAV的支持来完成其传输。为此，无人机有可能采用两个不同的频段，即典型的微波和高速毫米波段。在本文中，我们开发了一个通用框架，用于将UAV分配给支持的收发器并优化其轨迹，从而最大限度地减少总服务时间的加权函数。考虑到中继消息所需的通信时间和UAV的飞行时间，制定了旨在找到UAV悬停以将数据转发到接收器的停止的混合非线性编程问题。然后开发迭代方法来解决该问题。首先，最优地求解混合线性规划问题以确定每个可用UAV的路径。然后，执行分层迭代搜索以增强无人机停靠位置并减少服务时间。针对选定的场景展示了无人机的行为和所提出的框架的好处。
