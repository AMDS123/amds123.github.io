##### Abstract
Mechanized theorem proving is becoming the basis of reliable systems programming and rigorous mathematics. Despite decades of progress in proof automation, writing mechanized proofs still requires engineers' expertise and remains labor intensive. Recently, researchers have extracted heuristics of interactive proof development from existing large proof corpora using supervised learning. However, such existing proof corpora present only one way of proving conjectures, while there are often multiple equivalently effective ways to prove one conjecture. In this abstract, we identify challenges in discovering heuristics for automatic proof search and propose our novel approach to improve heuristics of automatic proof search in Isabelle/HOL using evolutionary computation.
