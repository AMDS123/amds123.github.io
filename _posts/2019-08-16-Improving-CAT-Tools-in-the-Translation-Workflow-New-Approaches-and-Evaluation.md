##### Abstract
This paper describes strategies to improve an existing web-based computer-aided translation (CAT) tool entitled CATaLog Online. CATaLog Online provides a post-editing environment with simple yet helpful project management tools. It offers translation suggestions from translation memories (TM), machine translation (MT), and automatic post-editing (APE) and records detailed logs of post-editing activities. To test the new approaches proposed in this paper, we carried out a user study on an English--German translation task using CATaLog Online. User feedback revealed that the users preferred using CATaLog Online over existing CAT tools in some respects, especially by selecting the output of the MT system and taking advantage of the color scheme for TM suggestions.
