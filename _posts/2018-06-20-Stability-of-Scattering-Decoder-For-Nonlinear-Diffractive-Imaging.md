##### Abstract
The problem of image reconstruction under multiple light scattering is usually formulated as a regularized non-convex optimization. A deep learning architecture, Scattering Decoder (ScaDec), was recently proposed to solve this problem in a purely data-driven fashion. The proposed method was shown to substantially outperform optimization-based baselines and achieve state-of-the-art results. In this paper, we thoroughly test the robustness of ScaDec to different permittivity contrasts, number of transmissions, and input signal-to-noise ratios. The results on high-fidelity simulated datasets show that the performance of ScaDec is stable in different settings.

多光散射下的图像重建问题通常表现为规则化的非凸优化。最近提出了一种深度学习架构，即散射解码器（ScaDec），以纯数据驱动的方式解决这个问题。所提出的方法被证明基本上优于基于优化的基线并实现了最新的结果。在本文中，我们彻底测试了ScaDec对不同介电常数对比度，传输次数和输入信噪比的稳健性。高保真模拟数据集的结果表明，ScaDec的性能在不同的环境下是稳定的。
