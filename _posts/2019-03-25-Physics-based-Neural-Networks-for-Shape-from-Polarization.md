##### Abstract
How should prior knowledge from physics inform a neural network solution? We study the blending of physics and deep learning in the context of Shape from Polarization (SfP). The classic SfP problem recovers an object's shape from polarized photographs of the scene. The SfP problem is special because the physical models are only approximate. Previous attempts to solve SfP have been purely model-based, and are susceptible to errors when real-world conditions deviate from the idealized physics. In our solution, there is a subtlety to combining physics and neural networks. Our final solution blends deep learning with synthetic renderings (derived from physics) in the framework of a two-stage encoder. The lessons learned from this exemplary problem foreshadow the future impact of physics-based learning.
