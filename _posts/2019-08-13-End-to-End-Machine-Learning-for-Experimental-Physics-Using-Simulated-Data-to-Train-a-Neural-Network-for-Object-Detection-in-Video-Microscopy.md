##### Abstract
We demonstrate a method for training a convolutional neural network with simulated images for usage on real-world experimental data. Modern machine learning methods require large, robust training data sets to generate accurate predictions. Generating these large training sets requires a significant up-front time investment that is often impractical for small-scale applications. Here we demonstrate a `full-stack' computational solution, where the training data set is generated on-the-fly using a noise injection process to produce simulated data characteristic of the experimental system.
