##### Abstract
In this paper, a novel approach for automatic segmentation and classification of skin lesions is proposed. Initially, skin images are filtered to remove unwanted hairs and noise and then the segmentation process is carried out to extract lesion areas. For segmentation, a region growing method is applied by automatic initialization of seed points. The segmentation performance is measured with different well known measures and the results are appreciable. Subsequently, the extracted lesion areas are represented by color and texture features. SVM and k-NN classifiers are used along with their fusion for the classification using the extracted features. The performance of the system is tested on our own dataset of 726 samples from 141 images consisting of 5 different classes of diseases. The results are very promising with 46.71% and 34% of F-measure using SVM and k-NN classifier respectively and with 61% of F-measure for fusion of SVM and k-NN.

本文提出了一种自动分割和分类皮肤病变的新方法。最初，对皮肤图像进行过滤以去除不需要的毛发和噪声，然后执行分割过程以提取损伤区域。对于分割，通过种子点的自动初始化来应用区域生长方法。分割性能用不同的众所周知的措施进行测量，结果是可观的。随后，提取的病变区域由颜色和纹理特征表示。使用SVM和k-NN分类器以及它们的融合用于使用提取的特征进行分类。该系统的性能在我们自己的数据集上进行测试，这些数据集包含来自5种不同疾病类型的141个图像的726个样本。结果非常有希望，分别使用SVM和k-NN分类器的F-measure分别为46.71％和34％，SVM和k-NN的F-measure分别为61％和61％。
