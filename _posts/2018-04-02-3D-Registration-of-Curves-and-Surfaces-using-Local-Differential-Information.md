##### Abstract
This article presents for the first time a global method for registering 3D curves with 3D surfaces without requiring an initialization. The algorithm works with 2-tuples point+vector that consist in pairs of points augmented with the information of their tangents or normals. A closed-form solution for determining the alignment transformation from a pair of matching 2-tuples is proposed. In addition, the set of necessary conditions for two 2-tuples to match is derived. This allows fast search of correspondences that are used in an hypothesise-and-test framework for accomplishing global registration. Comparative experiments demonstrate that the proposed algorithm is the first effective solution for curve vs surface registration, with the method achieving accurate alignment in situations of small overlap and large percentage of outliers in a fraction of a second. The proposed framework is extended to the cases of curve vs curve and surface vs surface registration, with the former being particularly relevant since it is also a largely unsolved problem.

本文首次介绍了一种全局方法，该方法用于注册三维曲面的3D曲线而不需要初始化。该算法适用于2元组点+矢量，它们包含两个点，它们与其切线或法线的信息一起增加。提出了用于从一对匹配2元组中确定对齐转换的闭合解决方案。另外，推导出两个2元组匹配的必要条件集合。这允许快速搜索用于完成全局注册的假设和测试框架中的对应关系。对比实验表明，所提出的算法是曲线与曲面配准的第一个有效解决方案，该方法在小部分重叠情况下实现精确对齐，并在几分之一秒内实现大比例的异常值。拟议的框架扩展到曲线与曲线以及曲面与曲面配准的情况，前者特别相关，因为它也是一个很大的问题。
