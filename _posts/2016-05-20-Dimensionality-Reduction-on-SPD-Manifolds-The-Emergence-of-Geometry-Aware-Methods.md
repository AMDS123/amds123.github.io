##### Abstract
Representing images and videos with Symmetric Positive Definite (SPD) matrices, and considering the Riemannian geometry of the resulting space, has been shown to yield high discriminative power in many visual recognition tasks. Unfortunately, computation on the Riemannian manifold of SPD matrices -especially of high-dimensional ones- comes at a high cost that limits the applicability of existing techniques. In this paper, we introduce algorithms able to handle high-dimensional SPD matrices by constructing a lower-dimensional SPD manifold. To this end, we propose to model the mapping from the high-dimensional SPD manifold to the low-dimensional one with an orthonormal projection. This lets us formulate dimensionality reduction as the problem of finding a projection that yields a low-dimensional manifold either with maximum discriminative power in the supervised scenario, or with maximum variance of the data in the unsupervised one. We show that learning can be expressed as an optimization problem on a Grassmann manifold and discuss fast solutions for special cases. Our evaluation on several classification tasks evidences that our approach leads to a significant accuracy gain over state-of-the-art methods.

用对称正定（SPD）矩阵表示图像和视频，并且考虑到结果空间的黎曼几何，已经显示在许多视觉识别任务中产生高判别力。不幸的是，在SPD矩阵的黎曼流形（特别是高维矩阵）上的计算成本很高，限制了现有技术的适用性。在本文中，我们通过构建一个低维SPD流形介绍了能够处理高维SPD矩阵的算法。为此，我们建议使用正交投影来建立从高维SPD流形到低维流形的映射。这使得我们可以将维数降低作为找到一个投影的问题，这个投影可以在监督场景中产生一个具有最大鉴别能力的低维流形，或者在无监督情况下具有最大方差的数据。我们表明，学习可以表示为一个Grassmann流形上的优化问题，并讨论特殊情况下的快速解决方案。我们对几个分类任务的评估证明，我们的方法比最先进的方法获得了显着的准确性。
