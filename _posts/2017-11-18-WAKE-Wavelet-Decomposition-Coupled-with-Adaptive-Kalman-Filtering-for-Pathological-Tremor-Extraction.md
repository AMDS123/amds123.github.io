##### Abstract
Pathological Hand Tremor (PHT) is among common symptoms of several neurological movement disorders, which can significantly degrade quality of life of affected individuals. Beside pharmaceutical and surgical therapies, mechatronic technologies have been utilized to control PHTs. Most of these technologies function based on estimation, extraction, and characterization of tremor movement signals. Real-time extraction of tremor signal is of paramount importance because of its application in assistive and rehabilitative devices. In this paper, we propose a novel on-line adaptive method which can adjust the hyper-parameters of the filter to the variable characteristics of the tremor. The proposed technique (i.e., WAKE) is composed of a new adaptive Kalman filter and a wavelet transform core to provide indirect prediction of the tremor, one sample ahead of time, to be used for its suppression. In this paper, the design, implementation and evaluation of WAKE are given. The performance is evaluated on two different datasets. One dataset is recorded from patients with PHTs and the other one is a synthetic dataset, developed in this work, that simulates hand tremor under ten different conditions. The results demonstrate a significant improvement in the estimation accuracy in comparison with two well regarded techniques in literature.

病态手震（PHT）是几种神经运动障碍的常见症状之一，可显着降低受影响个体的生活质量。除了制药和外科治疗之外，机电一体化技术也被用于控制PHT。大多数这些技术基于震颤运动信号的估计，提取和表征。由于其在辅助和康复设备中的应用，实时提取震颤信号是非常重要的。在本文中，我们提出了一种新的在线自适应方法，可以根据震颤的变化特征来调整滤波器的超参数。所提出的技术（即WAKE）由一个新的自适应卡尔曼滤波器和一个小波变换核心组成，提供间接预测震颤，提前一个采样，用于抑制。本文给出了WAKE的设计，实现和评估。性能评估在两个不同的数据集上。一个数据集记录来自PHT患者，另一个数据集是在这项工作中开发的一个综合数据集，它模拟十种不同条件下的手部震颤。结果表明，与文献中两种被广泛关注的技术相比，估计精度的显着提高。
