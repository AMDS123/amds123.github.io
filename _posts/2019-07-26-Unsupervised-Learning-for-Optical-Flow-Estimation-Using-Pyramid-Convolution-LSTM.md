##### Abstract
Most of current Convolution Neural Network (CNN) based methods for optical flow estimation focus on learning optical flow on synthetic datasets with groundtruth, which is not practical. In this paper, we propose an unsupervised optical flow estimation framework named PCLNet. It uses pyramid Convolution LSTM (ConvLSTM) with the constraint of adjacent frame reconstruction, which allows flexibly estimating multi-frame optical flows from any video clip. Besides, by decoupling motion feature learning and optical flow representation, our method avoids complex short-cut connections used in existing frameworks while improving accuracy of optical flow estimation. Moreover, different from those methods using specialized CNN architectures for capturing motion, our framework directly learns optical flow from the features of generic CNNs and thus can be easily embedded in any CNN based frameworks for other tasks. Extensive experiments have verified that our method not only estimates optical flow effectively and accurately, but also obtains comparable performance on action recognition.
