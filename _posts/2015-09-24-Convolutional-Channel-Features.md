##### Abstract
Deep learning methods are powerful tools but often suffer from expensive computation and limited flexibility. An alternative is to combine light-weight models with deep representations. As successful cases exist in several visual problems, a unified framework is absent. In this paper, we revisit two widely used approaches in computer vision, namely filtered channel features and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), and absorb merits from both by proposing an integrated method called Convolutional Channel Features (CCF). CCF transfers low-level features from pre-trained CNN models to feed the boosting forest model. With the combination of CNN features and boosting forest, CCF benefits from the richer capacity in feature representation compared with channel features, as well as lower cost in computation and storage compared with end-to-end CNN methods. We show that CCF serves as a good way of tailoring pre-trained CNN models to diverse tasks without fine-tuning the whole network to each task by achieving state-of-the-art performances in pedestrian detection, face detection, edge detection and object proposal generation.

深度学习方法是强大的工具，但是往往会受到昂贵的计算和灵活性的限制另一种方法是将轻量级模型与深度表示相结合。由于几个视觉问题存在成功案例，缺乏一个统一的框架。在本文中，我们重新回顾了计算机视觉中被广泛使用的两种方法，即滤波信道特征和卷积神经网络（CNN），并通过提出一种称为卷积信道特征（CCF）的集成方法来吸收两者的优点。 CCF从预先训练的CNN模型转移低级特征以提供增强型森林模型。随着CNN特征与森林推广相结合，与端到端CNN方法相比，CCF在特征表示方面的性能与通道特征相比具有更丰富的功能，计算和存储成本更低。我们表明，CCF作为一种很好的方法，可以将预先训练的CNN模型定制为不同的任务，而不需要通过在行人检测，人脸检测，边缘检测和物体上获得最新的性能来对每个任务进行整个网络的微调建议一代。
