##### Abstract
With the advent of artificial intelligence and machine learning, humanoid robots are made to learn a variety of skills which humans possess. One of fundamental skills which humans use in day-to-day activities is performing tasks with coordination between both the hands. In case of humanoids, learning such skills require optimal motion planning which includes avoiding collisions with the surroundings. In this paper, we propose a framework to learn coordinated tasks in cluttered environments based on DiGrad - A multi-task reinforcement learning algorithm for continuous action-spaces. Further, we propose an algorithm to smooth the joint space trajectories obtained by the proposed framework in order to reduce the noise instilled during training. The proposed framework was tested on a 27 degrees of freedom (DoF) humanoid with articulated torso for performing coordinated object-reaching task with both the hands in four different environments with varying levels of difficulty. It is observed that the humanoid is able to plan collision free trajectory in real-time. Simulation results also reveal the usefulness of the articulated torso for performing tasks which require coordination between both the arms.

随着人工智能和机器学习的出现，类人机器人被用来学习人类拥有的各种技能。人类在日常活动中使用的基本技能之一是执行双手协调的任务。在类人动物的情况下，学习此类技能需要优化运动计划，其中包括避免与周围环境发生碰撞。在本文中，我们提出了一个基于DiGrad  - 连续动作空间的多任务强化学习算法来学习混乱环境中协调任务的框架。此外，我们提出了一种算法来平滑所提出的框架所获得的关节空间轨迹，以减少训练期间灌输的噪音。所提出的框架在具有铰接躯干的27度自由度（DoF）人形体上进行测试，用于在四个不同的环境中执行协调的物体伸展任务，其中所述环境具有不同的难度。据观察，人形机器人能够实时计划无碰撞轨迹。仿真结果还揭示了铰接躯干用于执行需要两臂之间协调的任务的有用性。
