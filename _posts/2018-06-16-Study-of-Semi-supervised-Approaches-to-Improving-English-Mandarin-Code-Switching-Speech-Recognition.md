##### Abstract
In this paper, we present our overall efforts to improve the performance of a code-switching speech recognition system using semi-supervised training methods from lexicon learning to acoustic modeling, on the South East Asian Mandarin-English (SEAME) data. We first investigate semi-supervised lexicon learning approach to adapt the canonical lexicon, which is meant to alleviate the heavily accented pronunciation issue within the code-switching conversation of the local area. As a result, the learned lexicon yields improved performance. Furthermore, we attempt to use semi-supervised training to deal with those transcriptions that are highly mismatched between human transcribers and ASR system. Specifically, we conduct semi-supervised training assuming those poorly transcribed data as unsupervised data. We found the semi-supervised acoustic modeling can lead to improved results. Finally, to make up for the limitation of the conventional n-gram language models due to data sparsity issue, we perform lattice rescoring using neural network language models, and significant WER reduction is obtained.

在本文中，我们提出了使用词典学习到声学建模的半监督训练方法来改进代码切换语音识别系统的性能的总体努力，其中使用了东南亚普通话 - 英语（SEAME）数据。我们首先研究半监督词典学习方法以适应规范词典，这是为了缓解当地代码转换对话中重音问题的发音问题。结果，学习的词汇提高了表现。此外，我们尝试使用半监督训练来处理人类转录因子与ASR系统之间高度错配的转录。具体而言，我们进行半监督训练，假设那些转录不良的数据为无监督数据。我们发现半监督声学建模可以改善结果。最后，为弥补由于数据稀疏问题导致的传统n元语言模型的局限性，我们使用神经网络语言模型执行格子重新编码，并且获得显着的WER减少。
