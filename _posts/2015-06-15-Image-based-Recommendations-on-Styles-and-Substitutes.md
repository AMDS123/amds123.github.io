##### Abstract
Humans inevitably develop a sense of the relationships between objects, some of which are based on their appearance. Some pairs of objects might be seen as being alternatives to each other (such as two pairs of jeans), while others may be seen as being complementary (such as a pair of jeans and a matching shirt). This information guides many of the choices that people make, from buying clothes to their interactions with each other. We seek here to model this human sense of the relationships between objects based on their appearance. Our approach is not based on fine-grained modeling of user annotations but rather on capturing the largest dataset possible and developing a scalable method for uncovering human notions of the visual relationships within. We cast this as a network inference problem defined on graphs of related images, and provide a large-scale dataset for the training and evaluation of the same. The system we develop is capable of recommending which clothes and accessories will go well together (and which will not), amongst a host of other applications.

##### Abstract (translated by Google)
人类不可避免地发展出物体之间关系的感觉，其中一些物体是以其外观为基础的。有些对象可能被看作是彼此的替代品（比如两条牛仔裤），而另一些对象可能被看作是互补的（比如一条牛仔裤和一件匹配的衬衫）。这些信息指导了人们从购买衣服到互相交流的许多选择。我们在这里寻求根据它们的外观来模拟这种人类对象之间关系的感觉。我们的方法不是基于用户注释的细粒度建模，而是基于捕获可能的最大数据集，并开发一种可扩展的方法来揭示人类内部视觉关系的概念。我们把这个作为一个网络推理问题定义在相关图像的图形上，并提供一个大规模的数据集来进行训练和评估。我们开发的系统能够推荐哪些衣服和配件能够很好地结合在一起（哪些不会），以及其他许多应用中。
