##### Abstract
This paper presents a successful application of deep learning for object recognition based on acoustic data. The shortcomings of previously employed approaches where handcrafted features describing the acoustic data are being used, include limiting the capability of the found representation to be widely applicable and facing the risk of capturing only insignificant characteristics for a task. In contrast, there is no need to define the feature representation format when using multilayer/deep learning architecture methods: features can be learned from raw sensor data without defining discriminative characteristics a-priori. In this paper, stacked denoising autoencoders are applied to train a deep learning model. Knocking each object in our test set 120 times with a marker pen to obtain the auditory data, thirty different objects were successfully classified in our experiment and each object was knocked 120 times by a marker pen to obtain the auditory data. By employing the proposed deep learning framework, a high accuracy of 91.50% was achieved. A traditional method using handcrafted features with a shallow classifier was taken as a benchmark and the attained recognition rate was only 58.22%. Interestingly, a recognition rate of 82.00% was achieved when using a shallow classifier with raw acoustic data as input. In addition, we could show that the time taken to classify one object using deep learning was far less (by a factor of more than 6) than utilizing the traditional method. It was also explored how different model parameters in our deep architecture affect the recognition performance.

本文提出了基于声学数据的深度学习在物体识别中的成功应用。先前采用的方法中使用描述声学数据的手工特征的缺点包括限制找到的表示的能力被广泛应用，并且面临着仅捕获任务的微不足道的特征的风险。相比之下，当使用多层/深度学习架构方法时，不需要定义特征表示格式：可以从原始传感器数据中学习特征而不先定义判别特征。在本文中，堆叠去噪自动编码器被用来训练一个深度学习模型。用记号笔敲击测试集中的每个物体120次以获得听觉数据，在我们的实验中成功地分类了30个不同的物体，并且用记号笔敲打每个物体120次以获得听觉数据。通过采用所提出的深度学习框架，达到了91.50％的高精度。以传统手工特征浅分类器为基准，识别率仅为58.22％。有趣的是，当使用原始声学数据作为输入的浅分类器时，识别率达到了82.00％。此外，我们可以证明，使用深度学习对一个对象进行分类的时间比使用传统方法的时间要少得多（大于6倍）。还探讨了深层架构中不同的模型参数如何影响识别性能。
