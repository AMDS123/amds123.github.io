##### Abstract
Breast cancer is the most frequently reported cancer type among the women around the globe and beyond that it has the second highest female fatality rate among all cancer types. Despite all the progresses made in prevention and early intervention, early prognosis and survival prediction rates are still unsatisfactory. In this paper, we propose a novel type of perceptron called L-Perceptron which outperforms all the previous supervised learning methods by reaching 97.42 \% and 98.73 \% in terms of accuracy and sensitivity, respectively in Wisconsin Breast Cancer dataset. Experimental results on Haberman's Breast Cancer Survival dataset, show the superiority of proposed method by reaching 75.18 \% and 83.86 \% in terms of accuracy and F1 score, respectively. The results are the best reported ones obtained in 10-fold cross validation in absence of any preprocessing or feature selection.
