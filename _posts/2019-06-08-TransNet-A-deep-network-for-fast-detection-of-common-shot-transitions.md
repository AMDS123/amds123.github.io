##### Abstract
Shot boundary detection (SBD) is an important first step in many video processing applications. This paper presents a simple modular convolutional neural network architecture that achieves state-of-the-art results on the RAI dataset with well above real-time inference speed even on a single mediocre GPU. The network employs dilated convolutions and operates just on small resized frames. The training process employed randomly generated transitions using selected shots from the TRECVID IACC.3 dataset. The code and a selected trained network will be available at https://github.com/soCzech/TransNet.
