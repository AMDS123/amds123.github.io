##### Abstract
Morphological attribute profiles (APs) are among the most effective methods to model the spatial and contextual information for the analysis of remote sensing images, especially for classification task. Since their first introduction to this field in early 2010's, many research studies have been contributed not only to exploit and adapt their use to different applications, but also to extend and improve their performance for better dealing with more complex data. In this paper, we revisit and discuss different developments and extensions from APs which have drawn significant attention from researchers in the past few years. These studies are analyzed and gathered based on the concept of multi-stage AP construction. In our experiments, a comparative study on classification results of two remote sensing data is provided in order to show their significant improvements compared to the originally proposed APs.

形态学属性概况（APs）是对遥感图像分析的空间和背景信息进行建模的最有效的方法之一，特别是对于分类任务。自从他们在2010年初首次介绍这一领域以来，许多研究成果不仅有助于将它们的使用应用于不同的应用，而且还为了更好地处理更复杂的数据而扩展和改进其性能。在本文中，我们将重新讨论并讨论过去几年来受到研究人员重视的受影响人群的不同发展和扩展。这些研究基于多阶段AP构建的概念进行分析和收集。在我们的实验中，为了显示与最初提出的AP相比的显着改进，提供了关于两个遥感数据的分类结果的比较研究。
