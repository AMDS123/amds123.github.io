##### Abstract
The second-order statistics (SOS) can be applied in estimation of the pure spectra of chemical components from the spectrum of their mixture, when SOS seems to be good at estimation of spectral patterns, but their peak directions are opposite in some cases. In this paper, one method for judgment of the peak direction of the pure spectra was proposed, where the base line of the pure spectra was drawn by using their histograms and the peak directions were chosen so as to make all of the pure spectra located upwards over the base line. Results of the SOS analysis on the visible hyperspectral images of the mixture composed of two or three chemical components showed that the present method offered the reasonable shape and direction of the pure spectra of its components.

二阶统计量（SOS）可用于从混合物光谱估计化学成分的纯光谱，当SOS似乎对光谱模式的估计很好时，但在某些情况下它们的峰值方向相反。本文提出了一种纯光谱峰值方向的判断方法，用直方图绘制纯光谱的基线，选取峰值方向，使纯光谱全部向上在基线上。对两种或三种化学成分混合物的可见高光谱图像进行SOS分析，结果表明，本方法为其各组分的纯谱提供了合理的形状和方向。
