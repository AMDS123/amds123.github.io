##### Abstract
The current paper proposes a novel neural network model for recognizing visually perceived human actions. The proposed multiple spatio-temporal scales recurrent neural network (MSTRNN) model is derived by introducing multiple timescale recurrent dynamics to the conventional convolutional neural network model. One of the essential characteristics of the MSTRNN is that its architecture imposes both spatial and temporal constraints simultaneously on the neural activity which vary in multiple scales among different layers. As suggested by the principle of the upward and downward causation, it is assumed that the network can develop meaningful structures such as functional hierarchy by taking advantage of such constraints during the course of learning. To evaluate the characteristics of the model, the current study uses three types of human action video dataset consisting of different types of primitive actions and different levels of compositionality on them. The performance of the MSTRNN in testing with these dataset is compared with the ones by other representative deep learning models used in the field. The analysis of the internal representation obtained through the learning with the dataset clarifies what sorts of functional hierarchy can be developed by extracting the essential compositionality underlying the dataset.

目前的论文提出了一种新的神经网络模型来识别视觉感知的人类行为。提出的多时空尺度递归神经网络（MSTRNN）模型是通过引入多时间尺度递归动力学的传统卷积神经网络模型来推导的。 MSTRNN的基本特征之一是其体系结构同时对不同层次之间的多个尺度变化的神经活动施加空间和时间约束。正如上下因果原理所表明的那样，假定网络可以在学习过程中利用这些约束来发展有意义的结构，例如功能等级。为了评估模型的特点，本研究使用了三类人类活动视频数据集，这些数据集由不同类型的原始动作和不同级别的组合性组成。用这些数据集测试MSTRNN的性能与其他在该领域使用的代表性深度学习模型的性能进行比较。通过对数据集的学习获得的内部表示的分析阐明了通过提取数据集的基本组合性可以开发哪种功能层次结构。
