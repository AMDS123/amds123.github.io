##### Abstract
The problem of indoor navigation of mobile objects, using a map and measurements of distances to the walls is considered. A nonlinear filtering problem aimed at calculating the optimal, in the root-mean-square sense, of the sought parameters is formulated in the context of the Bayesian approach. The algorithm for its solution based on the point-mass method is described. The simulation results illustrating the advantages of the proposed problem statement and the resultant algorithm are discussed.
