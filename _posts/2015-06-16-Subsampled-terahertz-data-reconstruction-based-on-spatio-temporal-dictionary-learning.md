##### Abstract
In this paper, the problem of terahertz pulsed imaging and reconstruction is addressed. It is assumed that an incomplete (subsampled) three dimensional THz data set has been acquired and the aim is to recover all missing samples. A sparsity-inducing approach is proposed for this purpose. First, a simple interpolation is applied to incomplete noisy data. Then, we propose a spatio-temporal dictionary learning method to obtain an appropriate sparse representation of data based on a joint sparse recovery algorithm. Then, using the sparse coefficients and the learned dictionary, the 3D data is effectively denoised by minimizing a simple cost function. We consider two types of terahertz data to evaluate the performance of the proposed approach; THz data acquired for a model sample with clear layered structures (e.g., a T-shape plastic sheet buried in a polythene pellet), and pharmaceutical tablet data (with low spatial resolution). The achieved signal-to-noise-ratio for reconstruction of T-shape data, from only 5% observation was 19 dB. Moreover, the accuracies of obtained thickness and depth measurements for pharmaceutical tablet data after reconstruction from 10% observation were 98.8%, and 99.9%, respectively. These results, along with chemical mapping analysis, presented at the end of this paper, confirm the accuracy of the proposed method.

本文介绍了太赫兹脉冲成像和重建的问题。假设已经获得了不完整（二次采样）的三维THz数据集，目标是恢复所有缺失的样本。为此提出了一种稀疏诱导方法。首先，对不完整的噪声数据应用简单的插值。然后，我们提出了一种基于联合稀疏恢复算法的时空字典学习方法，以获得适当的数据稀疏表示。然后，通过使用稀疏系数和学习的字典，通过最小化简单的成本函数来有效地去除3D数据。我们考虑两种类型的太赫兹数据来评估所提出的方法的性能;对于具有清晰分层结构的模型样品（例如埋在聚乙烯颗粒中的T形塑料片）和药片数据（具有低空间分辨率）获取的THz数据。实现T形数据重建的信噪比仅为5％，为19 dB。此外，从10％的观察结果重建后获得的药片数据的厚度和深度测量的准确度分别为98.8％和99.9％。这些结果，以及化学映射分析，在本文结束时提出，确认所提出的方法的准确性。
