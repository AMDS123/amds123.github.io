##### Abstract
Mental illness is one of the most pressing public health issues of our time. While counseling and psychotherapy can be effective treatments, our knowledge about how to conduct successful counseling conversations has been limited due to lack of large-scale data with labeled outcomes of the conversations. In this paper, we present a large-scale, quantitative study on the discourse of text-message-based counseling conversations. We develop a set of novel computational discourse analysis methods to measure how various linguistic aspects of conversations are correlated with conversation outcomes. Applying techniques such as sequence-based conversation models, language model comparisons, message clustering, and psycholinguistics-inspired word frequency analyses, we discover actionable conversation strategies that are associated with better conversation outcomes.

精神疾病是我们这个时代最紧迫的公共卫生问题之一。虽然咨询和心理治疗可以是有效的治疗方法，但是由于缺乏具有标记结果的大规模数据，我们对于如何进行成功的咨询对话的知识受到限制。在本文中，我们对基于短信的咨询对话的话语进行了大规模，定量的研究。我们开发了一套新颖的计算话语分析方法来衡量谈话的各种语言方面如何与谈话结果相关联。应用基于序列的对话模型，语言模型比较，信息聚类和心理语言学启发的词频分析等技术，我们发现与更好的对话结果相关的可操作对话策略。
