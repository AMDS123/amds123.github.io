##### Abstract
Community based question answering services have arisen as a popular knowledge sharing pattern for netizens. With abundant interactions among users, individuals are capable of obtaining satisfactory information. However, it is not effective for users to attain answers within minutes. Users have to check the progress over time until the satisfying answers submitted. We address this problem as a user personalized satisfaction prediction task. Existing methods usually exploit manual feature selection. It is not desirable as it requires careful design and is labor intensive. In this paper, we settle this issue by developing a new multiple instance deep learning framework. Specifically, in our settings, each question follows a weakly supervised learning multiple instance learning assumption, where its obtained answers can be regarded as instance sets and we define the question resolved with at least one satisfactory answer. We thus design an efficient framework exploiting multiple instance learning property with deep learning to model the question answer pairs. Extensive experiments on large scale datasets from Stack Exchange demonstrate the feasibility of our proposed framework in predicting askers personalized satisfaction. Our framework can be extended to numerous applications such as UI satisfaction Prediction, multi armed bandit problem, expert finding and so on.

基于社区的问答服务已经成为网民普遍的知识分享模式。用户之间的互动充分，个人能够获得满意的信息。然而，用户在几分钟之内就无法获得答案。用户必须检查一段时间的进度，直到提交满意的答案。我们将此问题作为用户个性化满意度预测任务来解决。现有的方法通常利用手动特征选择。这是不可取的，因为它需要仔细的设计和劳动密集型的。在本文中，我们通过开发一个新的多实例深度学习框架来解决这个问题。具体来说，在我们的设置中，每个问题都遵循弱监督学习多实例学习假设，其中获得的答案可以被视为实例集，并且我们定义问题解决至少一个满意的答案。因此，我们设计了一个高效的框架，利用深度学习的多实例学习属性来模拟问题答案对。来自Stack Exchange的大规模数据集的大量实验证明了我们提出的框架在预测个体满意度方面的可行性。我们的框架可以扩展到UI满意度预测，多武装强盗问题，专家发现等众多应用。
