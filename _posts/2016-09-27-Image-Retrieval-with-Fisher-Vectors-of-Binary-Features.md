##### Abstract
Recently, the Fisher vector representation of local features has attracted much attention because of its effectiveness in both image classification and image retrieval. Another trend in the area of image retrieval is the use of binary features such as ORB, FREAK, and BRISK. Considering the significant performance improvement for accuracy in both image classification and retrieval by the Fisher vector of continuous feature descriptors, if the Fisher vector were also to be applied to binary features, we would receive similar benefits in binary feature based image retrieval and classification. In this paper, we derive the closed-form approximation of the Fisher vector of binary features modeled by the Bernoulli mixture model. We also propose accelerating the Fisher vector by using the approximate value of posterior probability. Experiments show that the Fisher vector representation significantly improves the accuracy of image retrieval compared with a bag of binary words approach.

最近，Fisher矢量表示的局部特征因其在图像分类和图像检索方面的有效性而引起了人们的广泛关注。图像检索领域的另一个趋势是使用二进制特征，如ORB，FREAK和BRISK。考虑到连续特征描述符的Fisher矢量对图像分类和检索精度的显着提高，如果将Fisher矢量也应用于二值特征，在基于二值特征的图像检索和分类方面将会获得类似的好处。本文推导了伯努利混合模型模拟的二元特征向量的闭型近似。我们也提出使用后验概率的近似值来加速Fisher向量。实验表明，与一袋二进制文字方法相比，Fisher矢量表示法显着提高了图像检索的准确性。
