##### Abstract
The "digital Michelangelo project" was a seminal computer vision project in the early 2000's that pushed the capabilities of acquisition systems and involved multiple people from diverse fields, many of whom are now leaders in industry and academia. Reviewing this project with modern eyes provides us with the opportunity to reflect on several issues, relevant now as then to the field of computer vision and research in general, that go beyond the technical aspects of the work. This article was written in the context of a reading group competition at the week-long International Computer Vision Summer School 2017 (ICVSS) on Sicily, Italy. To deepen the participants understanding of computer vision and to foster a sense of community, various reading groups were tasked to highlight important lessons which may be learned from provided literature, going beyond the contents of the paper. This report is the winning entry of this guided discourse (Fig. 1). The authors closely examined the origins, fruits and most importantly lessons about research in general which may be distilled from the "digital Michelangelo project". Discussions leading to this report were held within the group as well as with Hao Li, the group mentor.

##### Abstract (translated by Google)
“数字米开朗基罗计划”是2000年代初期的一个计算机视觉项目，它推动了采集系统的功能，涉及来自不同领域的多个人，其中许多人现在是工业界和学术界的领导者。用现代的眼光回顾这个项目，为我们提供了反思当前与计算机视觉和一般研究领域相关的几个问题的机会，超越了技术方面的工作。本文是在意大利西西里岛为期一周的国际计算机视觉暑期学校（ICVSS）的阅读小组竞赛中撰写的。为了加深参与者对计算机视觉的理解和培养社区意识，各个阅读小组的任务是突出重要的教训，可以从提供的文献中学习，超越本文的内容。这个报告是这个引导话语的获胜条目（图1）。作者仔细研究了从“数字米开朗基罗计划”中提炼出来的一般研究的起源，成果和最重要的教训。导致这个报告的讨论是在小组内部以及小组导师郝莉的讨论中进行的。
