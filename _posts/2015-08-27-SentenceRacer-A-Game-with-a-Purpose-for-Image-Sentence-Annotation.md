##### Abstract
Recently datasets that contain sentence descriptions of images have enabled models that can automatically generate image captions. However, collecting these datasets are still very expensive. Here, we present SentenceRacer, an online game that gathers and verifies descriptions of images at no cost. Similar to the game hangman, players compete to uncover words in a sentence that ultimately describes an image. SentenceRacer both generates and verifies that the sentences are accurate descriptions. We show that SentenceRacer generates annotations of higher quality than those generated on Amazon Mechanical Turk (AMT).

最近包含图像句子描述的数据集已启用可自动生成图像标题的模型。但是，收集这些数据集仍然非常昂贵。在这里，我们介绍SentenceRacer，一个在线游戏，收集和验证图像的描述，免费。类似于游戏的hang子手，玩家竞争揭示最终描述图像的句子中的单词。 SentenceRacer产生并验证这些句子是准确的描述。我们显示SentenceRacer生成的质量高于Amazon Mechanical Turk（AMT）生成的质量的注释。
