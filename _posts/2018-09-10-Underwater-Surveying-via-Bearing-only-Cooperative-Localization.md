##### Abstract
Bearing only cooperative localization has been used successfully on aerial and ground vehicles. In this paper we present an extension of the approach to the underwater domain. The focus is on adapting the technique to handle the challenging visibility conditions underwater. Furthermore, data from inertial, magnetic, and depth sensors are utilized to improve the robustness of the estimation. In addition to robotic applications, the presented technique can be used for cave mapping and for marine archeology surveying, both by human divers. Experimental results from different environments, including a fresh water, low visibility, lake in South Carolina; a cavern in Florida; and coral reefs in Barbados during the day and during the night, validate the robustness and the accuracy of the proposed approach.

轴承仅合作定位已成功用于空中和地面车辆。在本文中，我们提出了水下领域方法的扩展。重点是调整技术以应对水下具有挑战性的能见度条件。此外，来自惯性，磁性和深度传感器的数据被用于改善估计的稳健性。除了机器人应用之外，所提出的技术还可以用于人类潜水员的洞穴测绘和海洋考古测量。来自不同环境的实验结果，包括淡水，低能见度，南卡罗来纳州的湖泊;佛罗里达州的一个洞穴;白天和夜间在巴巴多斯的珊瑚礁，验证了拟议方法的稳健性和准确性。
