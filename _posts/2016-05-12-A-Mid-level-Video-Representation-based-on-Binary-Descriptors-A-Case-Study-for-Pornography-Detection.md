##### Abstract
With the growing amount of inappropriate content on the Internet, such as pornography, arises the need to detect and filter such material. The reason for this is given by the fact that such content is often prohibited in certain environments (e.g., schools and workplaces) or for certain publics (e.g., children). In recent years, many works have been mainly focused on detecting pornographic images and videos based on visual content, particularly on the detection of skin color. Although these approaches provide good results, they generally have the disadvantage of a high false positive rate since not all images with large areas of skin exposure are necessarily pornographic images, such as people wearing swimsuits or images related to sports. Local feature based approaches with Bag-of-Words models (BoW) have been successfully applied to visual recognition tasks in the context of pornography detection. Even though existing methods provide promising results, they use local feature descriptors that require a high computational processing time yielding high-dimensional vectors. In this work, we propose an approach for pornography detection based on local binary feature extraction and BossaNova image representation, a BoW model extension that preserves more richly the visual information. Moreover, we propose two approaches for video description based on the combination of mid-level representations namely BossaNova Video Descriptor (BNVD) and BoW Video Descriptor (BoW-VD). The proposed techniques are promising, achieving an accuracy of 92.40%, thus reducing the classification error by 16% over the current state-of-the-art local features approach on the Pornography dataset.

随着互联网上不适当的内容越来越多，例如色情，就需要检测和过滤这些材料。其原因是由于在某些环境（例如学校和工作场所）或某些公众（例如儿童）中经常禁止这种内容。近年来，许多作品主要集中在基于视觉内容的色情图像和视频检测上，特别是在检测肤色方面。尽管这些方法提供了良好的结果，但是它们通常具有高误报率的缺点，因为不是所有具有大面积皮肤暴露的图像都是必需的色情图像，例如穿着泳衣的人或与运动相关的图像。 Bag-of-Words模型（BoW）的基于局部特征的方法已经成功应用于色情检测领域的视觉识别任务。尽管现有的方法提供了有希望的结果，但是它们使用需要高计算处理时间的局部特征描述符来产生高维矢量。在这项工作中，我们提出了一种基于局部二值特征提取和BossaNova图像表示的色情检测方法，一种BoW模型扩展，可以更丰富地保存视觉信息。此外，本文提出了两种基于BossaNova视频描述符（BNVD）和BoW视频描述符（BoW-VD）的中间表示组合的视频描述方法。所提出的技术是有希望的，实现了92.40％的准确度，因此比色谱数据集上当前最先进的局部特征方法减少了16％的分类错误。
