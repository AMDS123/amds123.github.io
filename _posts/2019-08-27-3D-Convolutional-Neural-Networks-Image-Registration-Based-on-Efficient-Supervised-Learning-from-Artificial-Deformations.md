##### Abstract
We propose a supervised nonrigid image registration method, trained using artificial displacement vector fields (DVF), for which we propose and compare three network architectures. The artificial DVFs allow training in a fully supervised and voxel-wise dense manner, but without the cost usually associated with the creation of densely labeled data. We propose a scheme to artificially generate DVFs, and for chest CT registration augment these with simulated respiratory motion. The proposed architectures are embedded in a multi-stage approach, to increase the capture range of the proposed networks in order to more accurately predict larger displacements. The proposed method, RegNet, is evaluated on multiple databases of chest CT scans and achieved a target registration error of 2.32 $\pm$ 5.33 mm and 1.86 $\pm$ 2.12 mm on SPREAD and DIR-Lab-4DCT studies, respectively. The average inference time of RegNet with two stages is about 2.2 s.
