##### Abstract
Hate speech is commonly defined as any communication that disparages a target group of people based on some characteristic such as race, colour, ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation, nationality, religion, or other characteristic. Due to the massive rise of user-generated web content on social media, the amount of hate speech is also steadily increasing. Over the past years, interest in online hate speech detection and, particularly, the automation of this task has continuously grown, along with the societal impact of the phenomenon. This paper describes a hate speech dataset composed of thousands of sentences manually labelled as containing hate speech or not. The sentences have been extracted from Stormfront, a white supremacist forum. A custom annotation tool has been developed to carry out the manual labelling task which, among other things, allows the annotators to choose whether to read the context of a sentence before labelling it. The paper also provides a thoughtful qualitative and quantitative study of the resulting dataset and several baseline experiments with different classification models. The dataset is publicly available.

##### Abstract (translated by Google)
仇恨言论通常被定义为基于某些特征（例如种族，肤色，种族，性别，性取向，国籍，宗教或其他特征）贬低目标群体的任何沟通。由于社交媒体上用户生成的网络内容的大量增加，仇恨言论的数量也在稳步增加。在过去几年中，对在线仇恨语音检测的兴趣，特别是对这项任务的自动化，以及该现象的社会影响不断增长。本文描述了一个讨厌的语音数据集，该数据集由数千个手动标记为包含仇恨言语的句子组成。这句话是从白色至上主义论坛Stormfront中提取的。已经开发了一种自定义注释工具来执行手动标记任务，该任务除了其他之外，允许注释者在标记之前选择是否阅读句子的上下文。本文还对所得数据集进行了深思熟虑的定性和定量研究，并对不同分类模型进行了几次基线实验。数据集是公开的。
