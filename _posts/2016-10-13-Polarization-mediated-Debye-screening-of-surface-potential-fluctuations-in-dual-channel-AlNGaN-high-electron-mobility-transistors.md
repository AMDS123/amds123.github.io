##### Abstract
A dual-channel AlN/GaN/AlN/GaN high electron mobility transistor (HEMT) architecture is proposed, simulated, and demonstrated that suppresses gate lag due to surface-originated trapped charge. Dual two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG) channels are utilized such that the top 2DEG serves as an equipotential that screens potential fluctuations resulting from surface trapped charge. The bottom channel serves as the transistor's modulated channel. Two device modeling approaches have been performed as a means to guide the device design and to elucidate the relationship between the design and performance metrics. The modeling efforts include a self-consistent Poisson-Schrodinger solution for electrostatic simulation as well as hydrodynamic three-dimensional device modeling for three-dimensional electrostatics, steady-state, and transient simulations. Experimental results validated the HEMT design whereby homo-epitaxial growth on free-standing GaN substrates and fabrication of same-wafer dual-channel and recessed-gate AlN/GaN HEMTs have been demonstrated. Notable pulsed-gate performance has been achieved by the fabricated HEMTs through a gate lag ratio of 0.86 with minimal drain current collapse while maintaining high levels of dc and rf performance.

本文提出了一种双通道AlN / GaN / AlN / GaN高电子迁移率晶体管（HEMT）架构，仿真并验证了抑制表面源俘获电荷引起的栅极滞后现象。使用双二维电子气（2DEG）通道，使得顶部2DEG用作等势线，其屏蔽由表面捕获的电荷引起的潜在波动。底部通道用作晶体管的调制通道。已经执行了两种器件建模方法作为指导器件设计的手段，并阐明了设计和性能指标之间的关系。建模工作包括静电模拟的自洽Poisson-Schrodinger解决方案，以及三维静电，稳态和瞬态仿真的水动力学三维器件建模。实验结果验证了HEMT设计，在自支撑GaN衬底上的同外延生长和同晶圆双沟道和凹栅AlN / GaN HEMT的制造已被证明。所制造的HEMT通过0.86的栅极滞后比率实现了显着的脉冲栅极性能，同时保持高水平的直流和射频性能，同时最小的漏极电流崩溃。
