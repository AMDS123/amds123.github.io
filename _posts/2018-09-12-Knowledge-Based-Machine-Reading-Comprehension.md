##### Abstract
Machine reading comprehension (MRC) requires reasoning about both the knowledge involved in a document and knowledge about the world. However, existing datasets are typically dominated by questions that can be well solved by context matching, which fail to test this capability. To encourage the progress on knowledge-based reasoning in MRC, we present knowledge-based MRC in this paper, and build a new dataset consisting of 40,047 question-answer pairs. The annotation of this dataset is designed so that successfully answering the questions requires understanding and the knowledge involved in a document. We implement a framework consisting of both a question answering model and a question generation model, both of which take the knowledge extracted from the document as well as relevant facts from an external knowledge base such as Freebase/ProBase/Reverb/NELL. Results show that incorporating side information from external KB improves the accuracy of the baseline question answer system. We compare it with a standard MRC model BiDAF, and also provide the difficulty of the dataset and lay out remaining challenges.

机器阅读理解（MRC）需要推理文档中涉及的知识和关于世界的知识。但是，现有数据集通常由可以通过上下文匹配很好地解决的问题支配，这些问题无法测试此功能。为了鼓励MRC中基于知识的推理的进展，我们在本文中提出了基于知识的MRC，并构建了一个由40,047个问答配对组成的新数据集。设计此数据集的注释是为了成功回答问题，需要理解文档中涉及的知识和知识。我们实现了一个由问答模型和问题生成模型组成的框架，这两个模型都采用从文档中提取的知识以及来自外部知识库（如Freebase / ProBase / Reverb / NELL）的相关事实。结果表明，合并来自外部KB的边信息可提高基线问答系统的准确性。我们将其与标准MRC模型BiDAF进行比较，并提供数据集的难度并列出剩余的挑战。
