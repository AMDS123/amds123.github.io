##### Abstract
In this digital era, one thing that still holds the convention is a printed archive. Printed documents find their use in many critical domains such as contract papers, legal tenders and proof of identity documents. As more advanced printing, scanning and image editing techniques are becoming available, forgeries on these legal tenders pose a serious threat. Ability to easily and reliably identify source printer of a printed document can help a lot in reducing this menace. During printing procedure, printer hardware introduces certain distortions in printed characters' locations and shapes which are invisible to naked eyes. These distortions are referred as geometric distortions, their profile (or signature) is generally unique for each printer and can be used for printer classification purpose. This paper proposes a set of features for characterizing text-line-level geometric distortions, referred as geometric distortion signatures and presents a novel system to use them for identification of the origin of a printed document. Detailed experiments performed on a set of thirteen printers demonstrate that the proposed system achieves state of the art performance and gives much higher accuracy under small training size constraint. For four training and six test pages of three different fonts, the proposed method gives 99\% classification accuracy.

##### Abstract (translated by Google)
在这个数字时代，还有一个常规的东西就是印刷档案。印刷文件可用于许多关键领域，如合同文件，法定标书和身份证明文件。随着更高级的打印，扫描和图像编辑技术的出现，对这些合法招标的伪造构成了严重的威胁。能够轻松可靠地识别打印文档的源打印机可以帮助减轻这种威胁。在打印过程中，打印机硬件会在打印的字符的位置和肉眼看不见的形状中引入一定的扭曲。这些扭曲被称为几何扭曲，它们的轮廓（或签名）对于每个打印机通常是唯一的，并且可以用于打印机分类目的。本文提出了一组用于表征文本行级几何失真的特征，称为几何失真特征，并提出了一种新颖的系统来使用它们来识别打印文档的来源。在一组十三台打印机上进行的详细实验表明，所提出的系统实现了最先进的性能，并且在小的训练尺寸约束下提供了更高的精度。对于三种不同字体的四个训练和六个测试页面，所提出的方法给出99％的分类准确度。
