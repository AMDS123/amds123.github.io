##### Abstract
Machine learning plays a critical role in extracting meaningful information out of the zetabytes of sensor data collected every day. For some applications, the goal is to analyze and understand the data to identify trends (e.g., surveillance, portable/wearable electronics); in other applications, the goal is to take immediate action based the data (e.g., robotics/drones, self-driving cars, smart Internet of Things). For many of these applications, local embedded processing near the sensor is preferred over the cloud due to privacy or latency concerns, or limitations in the communication bandwidth. However, at the sensor there are often stringent constraints on energy consumption and cost in addition to throughput and accuracy requirements. Furthermore, flexibility is often required such that the processing can be adapted for different applications or environments (e.g., update the weights and model in the classifier). In many applications, machine learning often involves transforming the input data into a higher dimensional space, which, along with programmable weights, increases data movement and consequently energy consumption. In this paper, we will discuss how these challenges can be addressed at various levels of hardware design ranging from architecture, hardware-friendly algorithms, mixed-signal circuits, and advanced technologies (including memories and sensors).

机器学习在从每天收集的Z字节传感器数据中提取有意义的信息方面起着至关重要的作用。对于一些应用，目标是分析和理解数据以识别趋势（例如，监视，便携式/可穿戴式电子设备）;在其他应用中，目标是基于数据（例如，机器人/无人驾驶飞机，自动驾驶汽车，智能物联网）立即采取行动。对于这些应用中的许多应用，由于隐私或延迟问题或通信带宽的限制，传感器附近的本地嵌入式处理优于云。但是，在传感器上，除了吞吐量和精度要求之外，通常还存在对能量消耗和成本的严格限制。此外，经常需要灵活性，使得处理可适用于不同的应用或环境（例如，更新分类器中的权重和模型）。在许多应用中，机器学习经常涉及到将输入数据转换成更高维的空间，随着可编程的权重，增加数据移动，从而增加能源消耗。在本文中，我们将讨论如何在架构，硬件友好的算法，混合信号电路和先进技术（包括存储器和传感器）等不同层次的硬件设计中解决这些挑战。
