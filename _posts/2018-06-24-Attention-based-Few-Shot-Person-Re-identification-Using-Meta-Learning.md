##### Abstract
In this paper, we investigate the challenging task of person re-identification from a new perspective and propose an end-to-end attention-based architecture for few-shot re-identification through meta-learning. The motivation for this task lies in the fact that humans, can usually identify another person after just seeing that given person a few times (or even once) by attending to their memory. On the other hand, the unique nature of the person re-identification problem, i.e., only few examples exist per identity and new identities always appearing during testing, calls for a few shot learning architecture with the capacity of handling new identities. Hence, we frame the problem within a meta-learning setting, where a neural network based meta-learner is trained to optimize a learner i.e., an attention-based matching function. Another challenge of the person re-identification problem is the small inter-class difference between different identities and large intra-class difference of the same identity. In order to increase the discriminative power of the model, we propose a new attention-based feature encoding scheme that takes into account the critical intra-view and cross-view relationship of images. We refer to the proposed Attention-based Re-identification Metalearning model as ARM. Extensive evaluations demonstrate the advantages of the ARM as compared to the state-of-the-art on the challenging PRID2011, CUHK01, CUHK03 and Market1501 datasets.

在本文中，我们从一个新的角度研究了人重新识别的具有挑战性的任务，并提出了一种通过元学习为少数重新识别提供端到端注意的体系结构。这个任务的动机在于人类通常可以在看到给定的人几次（或甚至一次）的注意力后通过识别他们的记忆来识别另一个人。另一方面，人重新识别问题的独特性，即每个身份和测试期间总是出现的新身份仅存在少数例子，需要一些能够处理新身份的镜头学习架构。因此，我们在元学习环境中构建问题，其中基于神经网络的元学习者被训练以优化学习者，即基于注意力的匹配函数。人重新识别问题的另一个挑战是不同身份之间的小类间差异和同一身份的大类内差异。为了提高模型的判别力，我们提出了一种新的基于注意力的特征编码方案，该方案考虑了图像的关键视图间和交叉视图关系。我们将提出的基于注意的重新识别元学习模型称为ARM。与具有挑战性的PRID2011，CUHK01，CUHK03和Market1501数据集的最新技术相比，广泛的评估证明了ARM的优势。
