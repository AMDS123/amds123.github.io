##### Abstract
Using machine learning algorithms, including deep learning, we studied the prediction of personal attributes from the text of tweets, such as gender, occupation, and age groups. We applied word2vec to construct word vectors, which were then used to vectorize tweet blocks. The resulting tweet vectors were used as inputs for training models, and the prediction accuracy of those models was examined as a function of the dimension of the tweet vectors and the size of the tweet blacks. The results showed that the machine learning algorithms could predict the three personal attributes of interest with 60-70% accuracy.

使用机器学习算法，包括深度学习，我们研究了性别，职业和年龄组等个人属性的推文。我们使用word2vec来构造单词向量，然后用于向量化tweet块。得到的鸣叫向量被用作训练模型的输入，并且这些模型的预测准确度被作为鸣叫向量的维度和鸣叫黑色的大小的函数来检查。结果表明，机器学习算法能够以60-70％的准确度预测三个感兴趣的个人属性。
