##### Abstract
Recent advances in capsule endoscopy systems have introduced new methods and capabilities. The capsule endoscopy system, by observing the entire digestive tract, has significantly improved diagnosing gastrointestinal disorders and diseases. The system has challenges such as the need to enhance the quality of the transmitted images, low frame rates of transmission, and battery lifetime that need to be addressed. One of the important parts of a capsule endoscopy system is the image compression unit. Better compression of images increases the frame rate and hence improves the diagnosis process. In this paper a high precision compression algorithm with high compression ratio is proposed. In this algorithm we use the similarity between frames to compress the data more efficiently.

胶囊内窥镜系统的最新进展已经引入了新的方法和能力。通过观察整个消化道，胶囊内窥镜系统显着改善了胃肠道疾病和疾病的诊断。该系统面临诸如需要提高传输图像的质量，传输的低帧率以及需要解决的电池寿命等挑战。图像压缩单元是胶囊内窥镜系统的重要组成部分之一。更好的图像压缩增加了帧频，因此改善了诊断过程。本文提出了一种高压缩比的高精度压缩算法。在这个算法中，我们使用帧之间的相似性来更有效地压缩数据。
