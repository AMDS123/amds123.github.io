##### Abstract
Quantitative analysis of channel networks plays an important role in river studies. To provide a quantitative representation of channel networks, we propose a new method that extracts channels from remotely sensed images and estimates their widths. Our fully automated method is based on a recently proposed Multiscale Singularity Index that responds strongly to curvilinear structures but weakly to edges. The algorithm produces a channel map, using a single image where water and non-water pixels have contrast, such as a Landsat near-infrared band image or a water index defined on multiple bands. The proposed method provides a robust alternative to the procedures that are used in remote sensing of fluvial geomorphology and makes classification and analysis of channel networks easier. The source code of the algorithm is available at: this http URL

渠道网络的定量分析在河流研究中起着重要的作用。为了提供信道网络的定量表示，我们提出了一种从遥感图像中提取信道并估计其宽度的新方法。我们的全自动化方法基于最近提出的多尺度奇异性指数，其对曲线结构强烈反应，但对边缘弱。该算法使用单个图像生成通道图，其中水和非水像素具有对比度，诸如Landsat近红外波段图像或在多个波段上定义的水指数。该方法提供了一个鲁棒的替代程序，用于遥感河流地貌，使渠道网络的分类和分析更容易。该算法的源代码可在此http URL处获得
