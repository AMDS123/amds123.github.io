##### Abstract
Fraud has severely detrimental impacts on the business of social networks and other online applications. A user can become a fake celebrity by purchasing "zombie followers" on Twitter. A merchant can boost his reputation through fake reviews on Amazon. This phenomenon also conspicuously exists on Facebook, Yelp and TripAdvisor, etc. In all the cases, fraudsters try to manipulate the platform's ranking mechanism by faking interactions between the fake accounts they control and the target customers.
