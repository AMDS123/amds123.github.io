##### Abstract
Both hexagonal wurtzite and cubic zinc blend GaN phases were synthesized in GaAs by 50 keV N+ implantation at 400 deg C and subsequent annealing at 900 deg C for 15 min in N2 ambient. Crystallographic structural and Raman scattering studies revealed that GaN phases were grown for fluence above 2x1017 cm-2. Temperature-dependent photoluminescence study showed sharp direct band-to-band transition peak ~3.32 eV at temperature <= 200K. The intermediate bandgap value, with respect to ~3.4 eV for hexagonal and ~3.27 eV for cubic phases of GaN is an indicative for the formation of mixed hexagonal and cubic phases.
