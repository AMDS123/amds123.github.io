##### Abstract
Visual context is important in object recognition and it is still an open problem in computer vision. Along with the advent of deep convolutional neural networks (CNN), using contextual information with such systems starts to receive attention in the literature. At the same time, aerial imagery is gaining momentum. While advances in deep learning make good progress in aerial image analysis, this problem still poses many great challenges. Aerial images are often taken under poor lighting conditions and contain low resolution objects, many times occluded by trees or taller buildings. In this domain, in particular, visual context could be of great help, but there are still very few papers that consider context in aerial image understanding. Here we introduce context as a complementary way of recognizing objects. We propose a dual-stream deep neural network model that processes information along two independent pathways, one for local and another for global visual reasoning. The two are later combined in the final layers of processing. Our model learns to combine local object appearance as well as information from the larger scene at the same time and in a complementary way, such that together they form a powerful classifier. We test our dual-stream network on the task of segmentation of buildings and roads in aerial images and obtain state-of-the-art results on the Massachusetts Buildings Dataset. We also introduce two new datasets, for buildings and road segmentation, respectively, and study the relative importance of local appearance vs. the larger scene, as well as their performance in combination. While our local-global model could also be useful in general recognition tasks, we clearly demonstrate the effectiveness of visual context in conjunction with deep nets for aerial image understanding.

视觉环境在物体识别中很重要，在计算机视觉领域仍然是一个悬而未决的问题。随着深度卷积神经网络（CNN）的出现，使用上下文信息的系统开始在文献中得到关注。与此同时，航拍图像正在获得动力。虽然深度学习的进展在航空影像分析方面取得了良好的进展，但这个问题仍然面临着很多的挑战。空中图像通常在光线条件较差的情况下拍摄，并且包含低分辨率的物体，多次被树木或较高的建筑物遮挡。在这个领域，特别是视觉环境可能会有很大的帮助，但是在空间图像理解中还是很少有文章考虑环境。在这里，我们将上下文作为识别对象的补充方式。我们提出了一个双流深度神经网络模型，处理信息沿着两个独立的路径，一个为本地和另一个全球视觉推理。这两者后来被合并在最后的处理层中。我们的模型学习将局部物体的外观以及来自大场景的信息同时并以相辅相成的方式结合起来，形成一个强大的分类器。我们测试了我们的双流网络在航拍图像中建筑物和道路的分割任务，并获得了马萨诸塞州建筑数据集的最新成果。我们还分别为建筑物和道路分割引入了两个新的数据集，并研究了局部外观对较大场景的相对重要性以及它们的组合性能。虽然我们的本地 - 全球模式也可以用于一般识别任务，我们清楚地展示视觉环境的效果与深网用于空间图像理解。
