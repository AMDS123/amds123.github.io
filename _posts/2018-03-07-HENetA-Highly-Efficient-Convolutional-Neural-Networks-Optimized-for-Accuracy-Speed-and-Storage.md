##### Abstract
In order to enhance the real-time performance of convolutional neural networks(CNNs), more and more researchers are focusing on improving the efficiency of CNN. Based on the analysis of some CNN architectures, such as ResNet, DenseNet, ShuffleNet and so on, we combined their advantages and proposed a very efficient model called Highly Efficient Networks(HENet). The new architecture uses an unusual way to combine group convolution and channel shuffle which was mentioned in ShuffleNet. Inspired by ResNet and DenseNet, we also proposed a new way to use element-wise addition and concatenation connection with each block. In order to make greater use of feature maps, pooling operations are removed from HENet. The experiments show that our model's efficiency is more than 1 times higher than ShuffleNet on many open source datasets, such as CIFAR-10/100 and SVHN.

为了提高卷积神经网络（CNN）的实时性，越来越多的研究者致力于提高CNN的效率。在对ResNet，DenseNet，ShuffleNet等CNN体系结构进行分析的基础上，结合自己的优势，提出了一种非常有效的高效网络模型（HENet）。新的架构采用了一种不寻常的方式将ShuffleNet中提到的群组卷积和通道混洗相结合。受ResNet和DenseNet的启发，我们还提出了一种新的方法，使用每个块的元素方式添加和串联连接。为了更好地使用功能映射，汇集操作从HENet中移除。实验表明，我们的模型的效率比许多开源数据集（如CIFAR-10/100和SVHN）上的ShuffleNet高出1倍以上。
