##### Abstract
The Human visual perception of the world is of a large fixed image that is highly detailed and sharp. However, receptor density in the retina is not uniform: a small central region called the fovea is very dense and exhibits high resolution, whereas a peripheral region around it has much lower spatial resolution. Thus, contrary to our perception, we are only able to observe a very small region around the line of sight with high resolution. The perception of a complete and stable view is aided by an attention mechanism that directs the eyes to the numerous points of interest within the scene. The eyes move between these targets in quick, unconscious movements, known as "saccades". Once a target is centered at the fovea, the eyes fixate for a fraction of a second while the visual system extracts the necessary information. An artificial visual system was built based on a fully recurrent neural network set within a reinforcement learning protocol, and learned to attend to regions of interest while solving a classification task. The model is consistent with several experimentally observed phenomena, and suggests novel predictions.

世界的人类视觉感受是一个非常详细和尖锐的大的固定形象。然而，视网膜中的受体密度并不均匀：称为中央窝的小中心区域非常密集，分辨率高，而周围区域的空间分辨率低得多。因此，与我们的看法相反，我们只能以高分辨率观察视线周围的一个非常小的区域。一个完整和稳定的看法的感知是由一个注意机制，引导眼睛在场景内的众多兴趣点的帮助。这些目标之间的眼睛快速，无意识的运动，被称为“扫视”。一旦目标以中心凹为中心，眼睛就会在视觉系统提取必要的信息的同时，凝视一小会儿。在强化学习协议的基础上建立了一个基于完全递归神经网络集的人工视觉系统，并在解决分类任务时学会了关注感兴趣的区域。该模型与几个实验观察到的现象是一致的，并提出了新的预测。
