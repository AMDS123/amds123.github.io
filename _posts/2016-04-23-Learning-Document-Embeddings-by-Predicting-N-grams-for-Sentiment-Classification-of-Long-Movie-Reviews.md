##### Abstract
Despite the loss of semantic information, bag-of-ngram based methods still achieve state-of-the-art results for tasks such as sentiment classification of long movie reviews. Many document embeddings methods have been proposed to capture semantics, but they still can't outperform bag-of-ngram based methods on this task. In this paper, we modify the architecture of the recently proposed Paragraph Vector, allowing it to learn document vectors by predicting not only words, but n-gram features as well. Our model is able to capture both semantics and word order in documents while keeping the expressive power of learned vectors. Experimental results on IMDB movie review dataset shows that our model outperforms previous deep learning models and bag-of-ngram based models due to the above advantages. More robust results are also obtained when our model is combined with other models. The source code of our model will be also published together with this paper.

尽管丢失了语义信息，但基于数据包的方法仍然能够实现诸如长篇电影评论的情感分类之类的任务的最新结果。已经提出了许多文档嵌入方法来捕获语义，但是在这个任务上它们仍然不能胜过基于bag-of-ngram的方法。在本文中，我们修改了最近提出的段落向量的架构，允许它通过不仅预测词汇而且预测n-gram特征来学习文档向量。我们的模型能够捕捉文档中的语义和词序，同时保持学习向量的表达能力。 IMDB电影评论数据集的实验结果表明，由于上述优点，我们的模型胜过了以前的深度学习模型和基于bag-of-ngram的模型。当我们的模型与其他模型结合时，也可以获得更稳健的结果。我们的模型的源代码也将与本文一起发布。
