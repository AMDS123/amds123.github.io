##### Abstract
The Internet facilitates large-scale collaborative projects. The emergence of Web~2.0 platforms, where producers and consumers of content unify, has drastically changed the information market. On the one hand, the promise of the "wisdom of the crowd" has inspired successful projects such as Wikipedia, which has become the primary source of crowd-based information in many languages. On the other hand, the decentralized and often un-monitored environment of such projects may make them susceptible to systematic malfunction and misbehavior. In this work, we focus on Urban Dictionary, a crowd-sourced online dictionary. We combine computational methods with qualitative annotation and shed light on the overall features of Urban Dictionary in terms of growth, coverage and types of content. We measure a high presence of opinion-focused entries, as opposed to the meaning-focused entries that we expect from traditional dictionaries. Furthermore, Urban Dictionary covers many informal, unfamiliar words as well as proper nouns. There is also a high presence of offensive content, but highly offensive content tends to receive lower scores through the voting system. Our study highlights that Urban Dictionary has a higher content heterogeneity than found in traditional dictionaries, which poses challenges in terms in processing but also offers opportunities to analyze and track language innovation.

互联网促进了大规模的合作项目。 Web 2.0平台的出现，内容的生产者和消费者统一，大大改变了信息市场。一方面，“人群智慧”的承诺激发了成功的项目，如维基百科，它已经成为许多语言中基于人群的信息的主要来源。另一方面，此类项目的分散且往往未受监控的环境可能会使其容易受到系统故障和不当行为的影响。在这项工作中，我们专注于Urban Dictionary，这是一个众包的在线词典。我们将计算方法与定性标注相结合，从“增长率”，“覆盖率”和“内容类型”两方面阐述“城市字典”的整体特征。我们测量的是以意见为中心的参赛作品的高度存在，而不是我们对传统词典期望的意义重点词条。此外，“城市词典”涵盖了许多非正式的，陌生的词汇以及专有名词。冒犯性内容也很多，但是通过投票系统，冒犯性较高的内容往往会得到较低的分数。我们的研究强调，“城市词典”比传统词典具有更高的内容异质性，这在处理方面提出了挑战，同时也提供了分析和跟踪语言创新的机会。
