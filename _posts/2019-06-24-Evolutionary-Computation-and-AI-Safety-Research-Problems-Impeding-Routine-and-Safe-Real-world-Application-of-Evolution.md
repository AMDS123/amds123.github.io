##### Abstract
Recent developments in artificial intelligence and machine learning have spurred interest in the growing field of AI safety, which studies how to prevent human-harming accidents when deploying AI systems. This paper thus explores the intersection of AI safety with evolutionary computation, to show how safety issues arise in evolutionary computation and how understanding from evolutionary computational and biological evolution can inform the broader study of AI safety.
