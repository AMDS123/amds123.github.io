##### Abstract
Applications of safety, security, and rescue in robotics, such as multi-robot target tracking, involve the execution of information acquisition tasks by teams of mobile robots. However, in failure-prone or adversarial environments, robots get attacked, their communication channels get jammed, and their sensors may fail, resulting in the withdrawal of robots from the collective task, and consequently the inability of the remaining active robots to coordinate with each other. As a result, traditional design paradigms become insufficient and, in contrast, resilient designs against system-wide failures and attacks become important. In general, resilient design problems are hard, and even though they often involve objective functions that are monotone or submodular, scalable approximation algorithms for their solution have been hitherto unknown. In this paper, we provide the first algorithm, enabling the following capabilities: minimal communication, i.e., the algorithm is executed by the robots based only on minimal communication between them; system-wide resiliency, i.e., the algorithm is valid for any number of denial-of-service attacks and failures; and provable approximation performance, i.e., the algorithm ensures for all monotone (and not necessarily submodular) objective functions a solution that is finitely close to the optimal. We quantify our algorithm's approximation performance using a notion of curvature for monotone set functions. We support our theoretical analyses with simulated and real-world experiments, by considering an active information gathering scenario, namely, multi-robot target tracking.

安全，安全和救援在机器人技术中的应用，例如多机器人目标跟踪，涉及由移动机器人团队执行信息获取任务。然而，在容易出故障或对抗性的环境中，机器人受到攻击，他们的通信信道被卡住，他们的传感器可能会失败，从而导致机器人从集体任务中退出，因此剩余的主动机器人无法与每个机器人协调其他。结果，传统的设计范式变得不足，相反，针对系统范围的故障和攻击的弹性设计变得重要。通常，弹性设计问题是困难的，并且即使它们通常涉及单调或子模块的目标函数，其解决方案的可伸缩近似算法也是迄今未知的。在本文中，我们提供了第一种算法，它具有以下能力：最小的通信，即算法仅由机器人基于它们之间的最小通信来执行;系统范围的弹性，即该算法对任何数量的拒绝服务攻击和故障都有效;并且可证明的近似性能，即该算法确保所有单调（并且不一定是子模块）目标函数有限地接近最优的解。我们使用单调集函数的曲率概念量化我们的算法的近似性能。通过考虑主动信息收集场景，即多机器人目标跟踪，我们通过模拟和现实实验支持我们的理论分析。
