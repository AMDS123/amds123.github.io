##### Abstract
The pervasive use of distributional semantic models or word embeddings in a variety of research fields is due to their remarkable ability to represent the meanings of words for both practical application and cognitive modeling. However, little has been known about what kind of information is encoded in text-based word vectors. This lack of understanding is particularly problematic when word vectors are regarded as a model of semantic representation for abstract concepts. This paper attempts to reveal the internal information of distributional word vectors by the analysis using Binder et al.'s (2016) brain-based vectors, explicitly structured conceptual representations based on neurobiologically motivated attributes. In the analysis, the mapping from text-based vectors to brain-based vectors is trained and prediction performance is evaluated by comparing the estimated and original brain-based vectors. The analysis demonstrates that social and cognitive information is better encoded in text-based word vectors, but emotional information is not. This result is discussed in terms of embodied theories for abstract concepts.

分布式语义模型或​​词嵌入在各种研究领域的普遍使用，是由于其在实际应用和认知建模中表现词义的显着能力。然而，关于在基于文本的单词向量中编码什么样的信息知之甚少。当词向量被视为抽象概念的语义表示模型时，这种理解的缺失是特别有问题的。本文试图通过Binder等（2016）基于脑的向量分析，基于神经生物学动机属性的明确结构化的概念表示，揭示分布式词向量的内部信息。在分析中，从基于文本的矢量到基于脑的矢量的映射被训练，并且通过比较估计的和基于脑的矢量来评估预测性能。分析表明，社会和认知信息更好地编码在基于文本的单词向量，但情绪信息不是。这个结果是根据抽象概念的具体理论来讨论的。
