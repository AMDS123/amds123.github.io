##### Abstract
Leather is a type of natural, durable, flexible, soft, supple and pliable material with smooth texture. It is commonly used as a raw material to manufacture luxury consumer goods for high-end customers. To ensure good quality control on the leather products, one of the critical processes is the visual inspection step to spot the random defects on the leather surfaces and it is usually conducted by experienced experts. This paper presents an automatic mechanism to perform the leather defect classification. In particular, we focus on detecting tick-bite defects on a specific type of calf leather. Both the handcrafted feature extractors (i.e., edge detectors and statistical approach) and data-driven (i.e., artificial neural network) methods are utilized to represent the leather patches. Then, multiple classifiers (i.e., decision trees, Support Vector Machines, nearest neighbour and ensemble classifiers) are exploited to determine whether the test sample patches contain defective segments. Using the proposed method, we managed to get a classification accuracy rate of 84% from a sample of approximately 2500 pieces of 400 * 400 leather patches.
