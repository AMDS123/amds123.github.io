##### Abstract
Deep neural networks (DNNs) have achieved exceptional performances in many tasks, particularly, in supervised classification tasks. However, achievements with supervised classification tasks are based on large datasets with well-separated classes. Typically, real-world applications involve wild datasets that include similar classes; thus, evaluating similarities between classes and understanding relations among classes are important. To address this issue, a similarity metric, ClassSim, based on the misclassification ratios of trained DNNs is proposed herein. We conducted image recognition experiments to demonstrate that the proposed method provides better similarities compared with existing methods and is useful for classification problems. Source code including all experimental results is available at https://github.com/karino2/ClassSim/.

##### Abstract (translated by Google)
深度神经网络（DNN）在许多任务中取得了卓越的性能，特别是在监督分类任务中。然而，监督分类任务的成就是基于具有良好分离类的大型数据集。通常情况下，真实世界的应用程序涉及包含相似类的野生数据集;因此，评估阶级之间的相似性和理解阶级之间的关系是重要的。为了解决这个问题，本文提出了基于训练的DNN的错分率的相似性度量ClassSim。我们进行了图像识别实验，以证明所提出的方法提供了与现有方法相比更好的相似性，并且对于分类问题是有用的。包含所有实验结果的源代码可在https://github.com/karino2/ClassSim/上找到。
