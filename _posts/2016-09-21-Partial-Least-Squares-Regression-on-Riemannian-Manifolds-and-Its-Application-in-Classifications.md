##### Abstract
Partial least squares regression (PLSR) has been a popular technique to explore the linear relationship between two datasets. However, most of algorithm implementations of PLSR may only achieve a suboptimal solution through an optimization on the Euclidean space. In this paper, we propose several novel PLSR models on Riemannian manifolds and develop optimization algorithms based on Riemannian geometry of manifolds. This algorithm can calculate all the factors of PLSR globally to avoid suboptimal solutions. In a number of experiments, we have demonstrated the benefits of applying the proposed model and algorithm to a variety of learning tasks in pattern recognition and object classification.

偏最小二乘回归（PLSR）是探索两个数据集之间线性关系的流行技术。然而，大多数PLSR的算法实现只能通过对欧几里得空间的优化来实现次优解。在本文中，我们提出了几个黎曼流形上的新型PLSR模型，并基于黎曼几何流形开发了优化算法。该算法能够全面计算PLSR的所有因子，避免次优解。在许多实验中，我们已经证明了将所提出的模型和算法用于模式识别和对象分类中的各种学习任务的益处。
