##### Abstract
In large population-based studies and in clinical routine, tasks like disease diagnosis and progression prediction are inherently based on a rich set of multi-modal data, including imaging and other sensor data, clinical scores, phenotypes, labels and demographics. However, missing features, rater bias and inaccurate measurements are typical ailments of real-life medical datasets. Recently, it has been shown that deep learning with graph convolution neural networks (GCN) can outperform traditional machine learning in disease classification, but missing features remain an open problem. In this work, we follow up on the idea of modeling multi-modal disease classification as a matrix completion problem, with simultaneous classification and non-linear imputation of features. Compared to methods before, we arrange subjects in a graph-structure and solve classification through geometric matrix completion, which simulates a heat diffusion process that is learned and solved with a recurrent neural network. We demonstrate the potential of this method on the ADNI-based TADPOLE dataset and on the task of predicting the transition from MCI to Alzheimer's disease. With an AUC of 0.950 and classification accuracy of 87%, our approach outperforms standard linear and non-linear classifiers, as well as several state-of-the-art results in related literature, including a recently proposed GCN-based approach.

在大量基于人群的研究和临床常规中，诸如疾病诊断和进展预测等任务固有地基于丰富的多模式数据集，包括成像和其他传感器数据，临床评分，表型，标记和人口统计学。然而，遗漏的特征，评估者偏倚和不准确的测量结果是现实生活中医学数据集的典型症状。最近，已经表明，使用图形卷积神经网络（GCN）的深度学习可以超越传统的疾病分类中的机器学习，但是遗漏的特征仍然是一个开放的问题。在这项工作中，我们跟进了将多模态疾病分类建模为矩阵完成问题的想法，同时对特征进行分类和非线性插补。与之前的方法相比，我们将学科安排在一个图结构中，并通过几何矩阵完成来解决分类问题，该方法模拟用循环神经网络学习和解决的热扩散过程。我们证明了这种方法在基于ADNI的TADPOLE数据集和预测从MCI到阿尔茨海默病转变的任务上的潜力。 AUC为0.950，分类准确率为87％，我们的方法优于标准线性和非线性分类器，以及相关文献中的几项最新成果，包括最近提出的基于GCN的方法。
