##### Abstract
In this survey paper, we have evaluated several recent deep neural network (DNN) architectures on a TIMIT phone recognition task. We chose the TIMIT corpus due to its popularity and broad availability in the community. It also simulates a low-resource scenario that is helpful in minor languages. Also, we prefer the phone recognition task because it is much more sensitive to an acoustic model quality than a large vocabulary continuous speech recognition (LVCSR) task. In recent years, many DNN published papers reported results on TIMIT. However, the reported phone error rates (PERs) were often much higher than a PER of a simple feed-forward (FF) DNN. That was the main motivation of this paper: To provide a baseline DNNs with open-source scripts to easily replicate the baseline results for future papers with lowest possible PERs. According to our knowledge, the best-achieved PER of this survey is better than the best-published PER to date.

##### Abstract (translated by Google)
在这份调查报告中，我们评估了几种最新的深度神经网络（DNN）架构在TIMIT手机识别任务上的情况。我们之所以选择TIMIT语料库是因为它在社区中的流行度和广泛的可用性。它还模拟了对小语言有用的低资源情况。此外，我们更喜欢手机识别任务，因为它比声音模型质量对大型词汇连续语音识别（LVCSR）任务要敏感得多。近年来，许多DNN发表的论文报道了TIMIT的结果。但是，所报告的电话差错率（PER）通常远高于简单前馈（FF）DNN的PER。这是本文的主要动机：提供具有开源脚本的基准DNN，以便以尽可能低的PERs轻松地复制未来论文的基准结果。据我们所知，这次调查的最佳PER值要好于迄今为止公布的最高PER值。
