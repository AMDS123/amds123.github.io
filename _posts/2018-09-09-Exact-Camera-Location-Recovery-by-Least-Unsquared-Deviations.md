##### Abstract
We establish exact recovery for the Least Unsquared Deviations (LUD) algorithm of Ozyesil and Singer. More precisely, we show that for sufficiently many cameras with given corrupted pairwise directions, where both camera locations and pairwise directions are generated by a special probabilistic model, the LUD algorithm exactly recovers the camera locations with high probability. A similar exact recovery guarantee was established for the ShapeFit algorithm by Hand, Lee and Voroninski, but with typically less corruption.

我们建立了Ozyesil和Singer的最小非平方偏差（LUD）算法的精确恢复。更确切地说，我们表明，对于具有给定损坏的成对方向的足够多的相机，其中相机位置和成对方向由特殊概率模型生成，LUD算法以高概率精确地恢复相机位置。 Hand，Lee和Voroninski为ShapeFit算法建立了类似的精确恢复保证，但通常损坏较少。
