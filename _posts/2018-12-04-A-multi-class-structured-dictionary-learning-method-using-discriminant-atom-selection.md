##### Abstract
In the last decade, traditional dictionary learning methods have been successfully applied to various pattern classification tasks. Although these methods produce sparse representations of signals which are robust against distortions and missing data, such representations quite often turn out to be unsuitable if the final objective is signal classification. In order to overcome or at least to attenuate such a weakness, several new methods which incorporate discriminative information into sparse-inducing models have emerged in recent years. In particular, methods for discriminative dictionary learning have shown to be more accurate (in terms of signal classification) than the traditional ones, which are only focused on minimizing the total representation error. In this work, we present both a novel multi-class discriminative measure and an innovative dictionary learning method. For a given dictionary, this new measure, which takes into account not only when a particular atom is used for representing signals coming from a certain class and the magnitude of its corresponding representation coefficient, but also the effect that such an atom has in the total representation error, is capable of efficiently quantifying the degree of discriminability of each one of the atoms. On the other hand, the new dictionary construction method yields dictionaries which are highly suitable for multi-class classification tasks. Our method was tested with a widely used database for handwritten digit recognition and compared with three state-of-the-art classification methods. The results show that our method significantly outperforms the other three achieving good recognition rates and additionally, reducing the computational cost of the classifier.
