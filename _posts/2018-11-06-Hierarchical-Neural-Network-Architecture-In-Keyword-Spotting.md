##### Abstract
Keyword Spotting (KWS) provides the start signal of ASR problem, and thus it is essential to ensure a high recall rate. However, its real-time property requires low computation complexity. This contradiction inspires people to find a suitable model which is small enough to perform well in multi environments. To deal with this contradiction, we implement the Hierarchical Neural Network(HNN), which is proved to be effective in many speech recognition problems. HNN outperforms traditional DNN and CNN even though its model size and computation complexity are slightly less. Also, its simple topology structure makes easy to deploy on any device.
