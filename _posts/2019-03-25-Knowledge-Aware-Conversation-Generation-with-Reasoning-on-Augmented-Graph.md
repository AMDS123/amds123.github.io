##### Abstract
Two types of knowledge, factoid knowledge from graphs and non-factoid knowledge from unstructured documents, have been studied for knowledge aware open-domain conversation generation, in which edge information in graphs can help generalization of knowledge selectors, and text sentences of non-factoid knowledge can provide rich information for response generation. Fusion of knowledge triples and sentences might yield mutually reinforcing advantages for conversation generation, but there is less study on that. To address this challenge, we propose a knowledge aware chatting machine with three components, augmented knowledge graph containing both factoid and non-factoid knowledge, knowledge selector, and response generator. For knowledge selection on the graph, we formulate it as a problem of multi-hop graph reasoning that is more flexible in comparison with previous one-hop knowledge selection models. To fully leverage long text information that differentiates our graph from others, we improve a state of the art reasoning algorithm with machine reading comprehension technology. We demonstrate that supported by such unified knowledge and knowledge selection method, our system can generate more appropriate and informative responses than baselines.
