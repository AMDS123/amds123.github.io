##### Abstract
The vast amount of data and increase of computational capacity have allowed the analysis of texts from several perspectives, including the representation of texts as complex networks. Nodes of the network represent the words, and edges represent some relationship, usually word co-occurrence. Even though networked representations have been applied to study some tasks, such approaches are not usually combined with traditional models relying upon statistical paradigms. Because networked models are able to grasp textual patterns, we devised a hybrid classifier, called labelled subgraphs, that combines the frequency of common words with small structures found in the topology of the network, known as motifs. Our approach is illustrated in two contexts, authorship attribution and translationese identification. In the former, a set of novels written by different authors is analyzed. To identify translationese, texts from the Canadian Hansard and the European parliament were classified as to original and translated instances. Our results suggest that labelled subgraphs are able to represent texts and it should be further explored in other tasks, such as the analysis of text complexity, language proficiency, and machine translation.

##### Abstract (translated by Google)
大量数据和计算能力的增加使得从多个角度分析文本，包括将文本表示成复杂的网络。网络的节点代表单词，边代表一些关系，通常是单词同现。尽管网络化表征已被用于研究某些任务，但这种方法通常不会与依赖于统计范式的传统模型相结合。由于网络模型能够掌握文本模式，我们设计了一个称为标记子图的混合分类器，它将常见词的频率与在网络拓扑中发现的小型结构（称为基元）相结合。我们的方法在两种情况下进行说明，即作者归属和翻译识别。前者分析了不同作者写的一套小说。为了识别翻译文本，加拿大国会议事录和欧洲议会的文本被归类为原始和翻译的实例。我们的研究结果表明，有标签的子图能够代表文本，还应该在其他任务中进一步探索，如分析文本复杂性，语言熟练程度和机器翻译。
