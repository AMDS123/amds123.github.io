##### Abstract
Automated car license plate recognition systems are developed and applied for purpose of facilitating the surveillance, law enforcement, access control and intelligent transportation monitoring with least human intervention. In this paper, an algorithm based on SIFT feature points clustering and matching is proposed to address the issue of recognizing Malaysian special plates. These special plates do not follow the format of standard car plates as they may contain italic, cursive, connected and small letters. The algorithm is tested with 150 Malaysian special plate images under different environment and the promising experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm is relatively robust.

自动车牌识别系统的开发和应用是为了便于监控，执法，访问控制和智能交通监控，人为干预最少。本文提出了一种基于SIFT特征点聚类与匹配的算法来解决马来西亚特殊板块识别问题。这些特殊的盘子不遵循标准车牌的格式，因为它们可能包含斜体，草书，连接和小写字母。该算法在马来西亚150幅不同环境下的特殊平板图像上进行测试，实验结果表明该算法具有较强的鲁棒性。
