##### Abstract
Crowd counting on static images is a challenging problem due to scale variations. Recently deep neural networks have been shown to be effective in this task. However, existing neural-networks-based methods often use the multi-column or multi-network model to extract the scale-relevant features, which is more complicated for optimization and computation wasting. To this end, we propose a novel multi-scale convolutional neural network (MSCNN) for single image crowd counting. Based on the multi-scale blobs, the network is able to generate scale-relevant features for higher crowd counting performances in a single-column architecture, which is both accuracy and cost effective for practical applications. Complemental results show that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on both accuracy and robustness with far less number of parameters.

由于规模的变化，人群对静态图像的计数是一个具有挑战性的问题。最近深度神经网络已被证明是有效的这项任务。然而，现有的基于神经网络的方法通常使用多列或多网络模型来提取尺度相关特征，这对于优化和计算浪费来说更为复杂。为此，我们提出了一种新的多尺度卷积神经网络（MSCNN），用于单图像人群计数。基于多尺度斑点，网络能够在单列结构中产生与尺度相关的更高的人数计数性能，这对于实际应用来说既精确又具有成本效益。补充结果表明，我们的方法在精度和鲁棒性方面优于最先进的方法，参数数量少得多。
