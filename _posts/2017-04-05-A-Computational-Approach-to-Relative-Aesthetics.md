##### Abstract
Computational visual aesthetics has recently become an active research area. Existing state-of-art methods formulate this as a binary classification task where a given image is predicted to be beautiful or not. In many applications such as image retrieval and enhancement, it is more important to rank images based on their aesthetic quality instead of binary-categorizing them. Furthermore, in such applications, it may be possible that all images belong to the same category. Hence determining the aesthetic ranking of the images is more appropriate. To this end, we formulate a novel problem of ranking images with respect to their aesthetic quality. We construct a new dataset of image pairs with relative labels by carefully selecting images from the popular AVA dataset. Unlike in aesthetics classification, there is no single threshold which would determine the ranking order of the images across our entire dataset. We propose a deep neural network based approach that is trained on image pairs by incorporating principles from relative learning. Results show that such relative training procedure allows our network to rank the images with a higher accuracy than a state-of-art network trained on the same set of images using binary labels.

计算视觉美学近来成为一个活跃的研究领域。现有的最先进的方法将其作为预测给定图像是否美观的二元分类任务来制定。在图像检索和增强等许多应用中，根据图像的美学质量对图像进行排序而不是对图像进行二进制分类更为重要。此外，在这样的应用中，所有图像可能属于同一类别。因此，确定图像的美学排名是更合适的。为此，我们制定了一个新的图像排名问题的审美素质。我们通过从流行的AVA数据集中仔细选择图像，构建具有相关标签的图像对的新数据集。与美学分类不同的是，没有单一的阈值来确定整个数据集中图像的排序顺序。我们提出了一种基于深度神经网络的方法，通过结合相关学习的原理对图像对进行训练。结果表明，这样的相对训练程序允许我们的网络以比使用二进制标签在同一组图像上训练的最先进的网络更高的准确性排序图像。
