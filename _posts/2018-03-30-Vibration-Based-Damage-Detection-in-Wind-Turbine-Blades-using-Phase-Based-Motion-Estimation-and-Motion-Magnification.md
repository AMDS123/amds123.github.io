##### Abstract
Vibration-based Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) techniques are among the most common approaches for structural damage identification. The presence of damage in structures may be identified by monitoring the changes in dynamic behavior subject to external loading, and is typically performed by using experimental modal analysis (EMA) or operational modal analysis (OMA). These tools for SHM normally require a limited number of physically attached transducers (e.g. accelerometers) in order to record the response of the structure for further analysis. Signal conditioners, wires, wireless receivers and a data acquisition system (DAQ) are also typical components of traditional sensing systems used in vibration-based SHM. However, instrumentation of lightweight structures with contact sensors such as accelerometers may induce mass-loading effects, and for large-scale structures, the instrumentation is labor intensive and time consuming. Achieving high spatial measurement resolution for a large-scale structure is not always feasible while working with traditional contact sensors, and there is also the potential for a lack of reliability associated with fixed contact sensors in outliving the life-span of the host structure. Among the state-of-the-art non-contact measurements, digital video cameras are able to rapidly collect high-density spatial information from structures remotely. In this paper, the subtle motions from recorded video (i.e. a sequence of images) are extracted by means of Phase-based Motion Estimation (PME) and the extracted information is used to conduct damage identification on a 2.3-meter long Skystream wind turbine blade (WTB). The PME and phased-based motion magnification approach estimates the structural motion from the captured sequence of images for both a baseline and damaged test cases on a wind turbine blade.

基于振动的结构健康监测（SHM）技术是结构损伤识别最常用的方法之一。结构中损伤的存在可以通过监测受到外部载荷的动态行为的变化来识别，并且通常通过使用实验模态分析（EMA）或操作模态分析（OMA）来执行。这些用于SHM的工具通常需要有限数量的物理连接的换能器（例如加速度计）以便记录结构的响应以用于进一步分析。信号调节器，导线，无线接收器和数据采集系统（DAQ）也是振动型SHM中使用的传统传感系统的典型组件。然而，采用接触传感器（如加速度计）的轻型结构的仪器可能会引起质量负荷效应，而对于大型结构，仪器耗费人力和时间。在使用传统的接触式传感器时，实现大型结构的高空间测量分辨率并不总是可行的，并且在超出主机结构使用寿命的情况下，固定接触式传感器也缺乏可靠性。在最先进的非接触式测量中，数字摄像机能够从结构中快速收集高密度的空间信息。在本文中，通过基于相位的运动估计（PME）提取来自记录的视频（即图像序列）的微妙运动，并且所提取的信息用于在2.3米长的Skystream风力涡轮机叶片上进行损伤识别（WTB）。基于PME和基于分段的运动放大方法根据捕获的风力涡轮机叶片基线和损坏测试案例的图像序列来估计结构运动。
