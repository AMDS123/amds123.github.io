##### Abstract
Surveillance based on Computer Vision has become a major necessity in current era. Most of the surveillance systems operate on visible light imaging, but performance based on visible light imaging is limited due to some factors like variation in light intensity during the daytime. The matter of concern lies in the need for processing images in low light, such as in the need of nighttime surveillance. In this paper, we have proposed a novel approach for human detection using FLIR(Forward Looking Infrared) camera. As the principle involves sensing based on thermal radiation in the Near IR Region, it is possible to detect Humans from an image captured using a FLIR camera even in low light. The proposed method for human detection involves processing of Thermal images by using HOG (Histogram of Oriented Gradients) feature extraction technique along with some enhancements. The principle of the proposed technique lies in an adaptive background subtraction algorithm, which works in association with the HOG technique. By means of this method, we are able to reduce execution time, precision and some other parameters, which result in improvement of overall accuracy of the human detection system.

基于计算机视觉的监视已经成为当前时代的主要需求。大多数监视系统都是在可见光成像的基础上进行的，但是由于白天光强的变化等因素，基于可见光成像的性能受到限制。关注的问题在于需要在低照度下处理图像，例如需要夜间监视。在本文中，我们提出了一种新颖的使用FLIR（前视红外）摄像头进行人体检测的方法。由于原理涉及基于近红外区域中的热辐射的感测，所以即使在低光照下也可以从使用FLIR相机捕获的图像中检测人类。所提出的人体检测方法涉及通过使用HOG（取向梯度直方图）特征提取技术以及一些增强来处理热图像。所提出的技术的原理在于自适应背景减法算法，其与HOG技术相关联地工作。通过这种方法可以减少执行时间，精度等参数，从而提高人体检测系统的整体精度。
