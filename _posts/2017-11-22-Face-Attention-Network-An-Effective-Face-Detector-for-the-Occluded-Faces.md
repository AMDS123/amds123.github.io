##### Abstract
The performance of face detection has been largely improved with the development of convolutional neural network. However, the occlusion issue due to mask and sunglasses, is still a challenging problem. The improvement on the recall of these occluded cases usually brings the risk of high false positives. In this paper, we present a novel face detector called Face Attention Network (FAN), which can significantly improve the recall of the face detection problem in the occluded case without compromising the speed. More specifically, we propose a new anchor-level attention, which will highlight the features from the face region. Integrated with our anchor assign strategy and data augmentation techniques, we obtain state-of-art results on public face detection benchmarks like WiderFace and MAFA. The code will be released for reproduction.

随着卷积神经网络的发展，人脸检测的性能得到了很大的提高。然而，由于面具和太阳镜的遮挡问题，仍然是一个具有挑战性的问题。这些被遮挡案件的召回通常会带来高误报风险。在本文中，我们提出了一种称为人脸注意网络（Face Attention Network，FAN）的新型人脸检测器，能够在不影响速度的情况下显着提高被遮挡的人脸检测问题的召回率。更具体地说，我们提出了一个新的锚定层面的关注，这将突出脸部区域的特征。结合我们的锚点分配策略和数据增强技术，我们获得了像WiderFace和MAFA这样的公共人脸检测基准的最新成果。该代码将被发布以供复制。
