##### Abstract
This paper deals with the entity extraction task (named entity recognition) of a text mining process that aims at unveiling non-trivial semantic structures, such as relationships and interaction between entities or communities. In this paper we present a simple and efficient named entity extraction algorithm. The method, named PAMPO (PAttern Matching and POs tagging based algorithm for NER), relies on flexible pattern matching, part-of-speech tagging and lexical-based rules. It was developed to process texts written in Portuguese, however it is potentially applicable to other languages as well. We compare our approach with current alternatives that support Named Entity Recognition (NER) for content written in Portuguese. These are Alchemy, Zemanta and Rembrandt. Evaluation of the efficacy of the entity extraction method on several texts written in Portuguese indicates a considerable improvement on $recall$ and $F_1$ measures.

本文讨论了文本挖掘过程中的实体提取任务（命名实体识别），旨在揭示不重要的语义结构，如实体或社区之间的关系和交互。在本文中，我们提出了一个简单而高效的命名实体提取算法。该方法被称为PAMPO（用于NER的匹配和POs标记算法），依赖于灵活的模式匹配，词性标注和基于词汇的规则。它是为了处理用葡萄牙文写成的文本而开发的，但它也可能适用于其他语言。我们将我们的方法与支持以葡萄牙语撰写的内容的命名实体识别（NER）的当前替代方法进行比较。这些是炼金术，Zemanta和伦勃朗。实体提取方法对以葡萄牙文写成的几个文本的效力的评估表明，美元回扣美元和美元F_1 $措施有相当大的改善。
