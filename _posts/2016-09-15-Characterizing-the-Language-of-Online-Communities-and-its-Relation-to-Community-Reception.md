##### Abstract
This work investigates style and topic aspects of language in online communities: looking at both utility as an identifier of the community and correlation with community reception of content. Style is characterized using a hybrid word and part-of-speech tag n-gram language model, while topic is represented using Latent Dirichlet Allocation. Experiments with several Reddit forums show that style is a better indicator of community identity than topic, even for communities organized around specific topics. Further, there is a positive correlation between the community reception to a contribution and the style similarity to that community, but not so for topic similarity.

这项工作调查了在线社区中语言的风格和主题方面：将实用性作为社区的标识符，并与社区接收内容进行关联。风格的特点是使用混合词和词性标记n元语言模型，而主题是使用潜在Dirichlet分配。与几个Reddit论坛的实验表明，风格是比主题更好的社区身份指标，即使是围绕特定主题组织的社区。此外，社区接待与贡献之间呈正相关，与社区风格相似，但话题相似性则不如此。
