##### Abstract
The primary focus of autonomous driving research is to improve driving accuracy. While great progress has been made, state-of-the-art algorithms still fail at times. Such failures may have catastrophic consequences. It therefore is important that automated cars foresee problems ahead as early as possible. This is also of paramount importance if the driver will be asked to take over. We conjecture that failures do not occur randomly. For instance, driving models may fail more likely at places with heavy traffic, at complex intersections, and/or under adverse weather/illumination conditions. This work presents a method to learn to predict the occurrence of these failures, i.e. to assess how difficult a scene is to a given driving model and to possibly give the human driver an early headsup. A camera-based driving model is developed and trained over real driving datasets. The discrepancies between the model's predictions and the human `ground-truth' maneuvers were then recorded, to yield the `failure' scores. Experimental results show that the failure score can indeed be learned and predicted. Thus, our prediction method is able to improve the overall safety of an automated driving model by alerting the human driver timely, leading to better human-vehicle collaborative driving.

自动驾驶研究的主要焦点是提高驾驶准确性。虽然取得了很大的进步，但最新的算法仍然有时会失败。这种失败可能会造成灾难性后果。因此，自动化汽车尽早预见问题非常重要。如果司机被要求接管，这也是至关重要的。我们猜想，失败不会随机发生。例如，驾驶模型可能在交通繁忙，复杂交叉口和/或恶劣天气/照明条件下更可能失败。这项工作提供了一种方法来学习预测这些故障的发生，即评估一个场景对于给定的驾驶模型有多困难并且可能给予驾驶员一个提前的提醒。开发基于摄像头的驾驶模型并在真实驾驶数据集上进行训练。然后记录模型预测与人类“地面真相”演习之间的差异，得出“失败”分数。实验结果表明，失败分数确实可以被学习和预测。因此，我们的预测方法能够通过及时提醒驾驶员提高自动驾驶模型的整体安全性，从而实现更好的人车协作驾驶。
