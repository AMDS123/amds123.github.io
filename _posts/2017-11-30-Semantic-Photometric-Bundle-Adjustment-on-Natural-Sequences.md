##### Abstract
The problem of obtaining dense reconstruction of an object in a natural sequence of images has been long studied in computer vision. Classically this problem has been solved through the application of bundle adjustment (BA). More recently, excellent results have been attained through the application of photometric bundle adjustment (PBA) methods -- which directly minimize the photometric error across frames. A fundamental drawback to BA & PBA, however, is: (i) their reliance on having to view all points on the object, and (ii) for the object surface to be well textured. To circumvent these limitations we propose semantic PBA which incorporates a 3D object prior, obtained through deep learning, within the photometric bundle adjustment problem. We demonstrate state of the art performance in comparison to leading methods for object reconstruction across numerous natural sequences.

在计算机视觉中已经研究了在自然图像序列中获得对象的密集重建的问题。经典的这个问题已经通过应用束调整（BA）来解决。最近，通过应用光度束调整（PBA）方法已经获得了优异的结果，这些方法直接减小了帧间的光度误差。然而，BA和PBA的一个根本缺点是：（1）他们不得不查看对象上的所有点，（2）对物体表面进行良好的纹理处理。为了规避这些限制，我们提出了在光度束调整问题中通过深度学习获得先前3D对象的语义PBA。我们展示了与众多自然序列中的对象重建的领先方法相比最先进的性能。
