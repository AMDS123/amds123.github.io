##### Abstract
Food is an integral part of our life and what and how much we eat crucially affects our health. Our food choices largely depend on how we perceive certain characteristics of food, such as whether it is healthy, delicious or if it qualifies as a salad. But these perceptions differ from person to person and one person's "single lettuce leaf" might be another person's "side salad". Studying how food is perceived in relation to what it actually is typically involves a laboratory setup. Here we propose to use recent advances in image recognition to tackle this problem. Concretely, we use data for 1.9 million images from Instagram from the US to look at systematic differences in how a machine would objectively label an image compared to how a human subjectively does. We show that this difference, which we call the "perception gap", relates to a number of health outcomes observed at the county level. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that image recognition is being used to study the "misalignment" of how people describe food images vs. what they actually depict.

##### Abstract (translated by Google)
食物是我们生活中不可分割的一部分，我们吃什么和吃多少对我们的健康至关重要。我们的食物选择在很大程度上取决于我们如何看待食物的某些特性，例如是否健康，美味或是否可以用作沙拉。但这些看法因人而异，一个人的“单一的莴苣叶”可能是另一个人的“副沙拉”。研究食物如何被感知与实际的关系通常涉及实验室设置。在这里，我们建议使用图像识别的最新进展来解决这个问题。具体而言，我们使用来自美国Instagram的190万张图片的数据来研究机器如何客观地标记图像，而不是主观地如何。我们表明，这种差异，我们称之为“认知差距”，与在县一级观察到的一些健康结果有关。就我们所知，这是第一次使用图像识别来研究人们描述食物图像与他们实际描述的“错位”。
