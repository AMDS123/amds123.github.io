##### Abstract
The quality of machine translation is rapidly evolving. Today one can find several machine translation systems on the web that provide reasonable translations, although the systems are not perfect. In some specific domains, the quality may decrease. A recently proposed approach to this domain is neural machine translation. It aims at building a jointly-tuned single neural network that maximizes translation performance, a very different approach from traditional statistical machine translation. Recently proposed neural machine translation models often belong to the encoder-decoder family in which a source sentence is encoded into a fixed length vector that is, in turn, decoded to generate a translation. The present research examines the effects of different training methods on a Polish-English Machine Translation system used for medical data. The European Medicines Agency parallel text corpus was used as the basis for training of neural and statistical network-based translation systems. The main machine translation evaluation metrics have also been used in analysis of the systems. A comparison and implementation of a real-time medical translator is the main focus of our experiments.

机器翻译的质量正在迅速发展。今天，人们可以在网上找到几个能够提供合理翻译的机器翻译系统，尽管系统并不完美。在某些特定领域，质量可能会下降。最近提出的这个领域的方法是神经机器翻译。它旨在建立一个联合调整的单一神经网络，最大限度地提高翻译表现，这是一个非常不同于传统统计机器翻译的方法。最近提出的神经机器翻译模型通常属于编码器 - 解码器系列，其中源句子被编码成固定长度的矢量，该矢量又被解码以产生翻译。本研究考察了不同训练方法对用于医疗数据的波兰 - 英语机器翻译系统的影响。欧洲药品管理局的平行文本语料库被用作训练神经和统计网络翻译系统的基础。主要的机器翻译评估指标也被用于系统的分析。实时医疗翻译的比较和实现是我们实验的主要重点。
