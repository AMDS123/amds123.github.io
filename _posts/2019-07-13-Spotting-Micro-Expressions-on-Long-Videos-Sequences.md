##### Abstract
This paper presents baseline results for the first Micro-Expression Spotting Challenge 2019 by evaluating local temporal pattern (LTP) on SAMM and CAS(ME)2. The proposed LTP patterns are extracted by applying PCA in a temporal window on several facial local regions. The micro-expression sequences are then spotted by a local classification of LTP and a global fusion. The performance is evaluated by Leave-One-Subject-Out cross validation. Furthermore, we define the criteria of determining true positives in one video by overlap rate and set the metric F1-score for spotting performance of the whole database. The F1-score of baseline results for SAMM and CAS(ME)2 are 0.0316 and 0.0179, respectively.
