##### Abstract
As Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are considered the state-of-the-art in many classification tasks, the question of their semantic generalizations has been raised. To address semantic interpretability of learned features, we introduce a novel idea of classification by re-generation based on variational autoencoder (VAE) in which a separate encoder-decoder pair of VAE is trained for each class. Moreover, the proposed architecture overcomes the scalability issue in current DNN networks as there is no need to re-train the whole network with the addition of new classes and it can be done for each class separately. We also introduce a criterion based on Kullback-Leibler divergence to reject doubtful examples. This rejection criterion should improve the trust in the obtained results and can be further exploited to reject adversarial examples.

由于深度神经网络（DNN）被认为是许多分类任务中的最新技术，因此提出了它们的语义概括问题。为了解决学习特征的语义可解释性，我们引入了一种基于变分自动编码器（VAE）的再生分类的新思想，其中为每个类训练单独的编码器 - 解码器对VAE。此外，所提出的体系结构克服了当前DNN网络中的可扩展性问题，因为不需要通过添加新类来重新训练整个网络，并且可以分别对每个类进行。我们还引入了一个基于Kullback-Leibler散度的标准来拒绝可疑的例子。该拒绝标准应该提高对所获得结果的信任，并且可以进一步利用以拒绝对抗性示例。
