##### Abstract
In this paper we propose and investigate a novel end-to-end method for automatically generating short email responses, called Smart Reply. It generates semantically diverse suggestions that can be used as complete email responses with just one tap on mobile. The system is currently used in Inbox by Gmail and is responsible for assisting with 10% of all mobile responses. It is designed to work at very high throughput and process hundreds of millions of messages daily. The system exploits state-of-the-art, large-scale deep learning. We describe the architecture of the system as well as the challenges that we faced while building it, like response diversity and scalability. We also introduce a new method for semantic clustering of user-generated content that requires only a modest amount of explicitly labeled data.

在本文中，我们提出并研究一种自动生成短电子邮件响应的新型端到端方法，称为智能回复。它生成语义多样化的建议，只需轻点一下移动设备即可用作完整的电子邮件回复。该系统目前在Gmail收件箱中使用，并负责协助10％的所有移动应答。它被设计成以非常高的吞吐量工作，每天处理数以亿计的消息。该系统利用最先进的大规模深度学习。我们描述了系统的体系结构以及构建它时所面临的挑战，如响应的多样性和可扩展性。我们还介绍了一种用户生成内容的语义聚类的新方法，只需要适量的显式标记数据。
