##### Abstract
In case of salient subject recognition, computer algorithms have been heavily relied on scanning of images from top-left to bottom-right systematically and apply brute-force when attempting to locate objects of interest. Thus, the process turns out to be quite time consuming. Here a novel approach and a simple solution to the above problem is discussed. In this paper, we implement an approach to object manipulation and detection through segmentation map, which would help to desaturate or, in other words, wash out the background of the image. Evaluation for the performance is carried out using the Jaccard index against the well-known Ground-truth target box technique.
