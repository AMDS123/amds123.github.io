##### Abstract
Facial landmarks constitute the most compressed representation of faces and are known to preserve information such as pose, gender and facial structure present in the faces. Several works exist that attempt to perform high-level face-related analysis tasks based on landmarks. In contrast, in this work, an attempt is made to tackle the inverse problem of synthesizing faces from their respective landmarks. The primary aim of this work is to demonstrate that information preserved by landmarks (gender in particular) can be further accentuated by leveraging generative models to synthesize corresponding faces. Though the problem is particularly challenging due to its ill-posed nature, we believe that successful synthesis will enable several applications such as boosting performance of high-level face related tasks using landmark points and performing dataset augmentation. To this end, a novel face-synthesis method known as Gender Preserving Generative Adversarial Network (GP-GAN) that is guided by adversarial loss, perceptual loss and a gender preserving loss is presented. Further, we propose a novel generator sub-network UDeNet for GP-GAN that leverages advantages of U-Net and DenseNet architectures. Extensive experiments and comparison with recent methods are performed to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method.

面部标志构成面部的最压缩的表示，并被称为保存面部中存在的姿势，性别和面部结构等信息。存在几种尝试基于地标来执行与面部相关的高级分析任务的作品。相反，在这项工作中，试图解决从他们各自的地标合成人脸的逆问题。这项工作的主要目的是证明通过利用生成模型来合成相应的面孔，可以进一步加强由地标（特别是性别）保存的信息。虽然这个问题由于它的病态性质而特别具有挑战性，但我们相信成功的综合将能够实现一些应用，例如使用界标点来提高与高级人脸相关的任务的性能，并执行数据集增强。为此，提出了一种以对抗性损失，感知损失和性别维护损失为指导的面向性别保护的生成对抗网络（GP-GAN）的面部综合方法。此外，我们提出了一个新的GP-GAN发电机子网UDeNet，利用U-Net和DenseNet架构的优势。进行了大量的实验并与最近的方法进行了比较，以验证所提出方法的有效性。
