##### Abstract
The recently proposed subspace pseudointensity method for direction of arrival estimation is applied in the context of Tasks 1 and 2 of the LOCATA Challenge using the Eigenmike recordings. Specific implementation details are described and results reported for the development dataset, for which the ground truth source directions are available. For both single and multiple source scenarios, the average absolute error angle is about 9 degrees.
