##### Abstract
With the introduction of large-scale datasets and deep learning models capable of learning complex representations, impressive advances have emerged in face detection and recognition tasks. Despite such advances, existing datasets do not capture the difficulty of face recognition in the wildest scenarios, such as hostile disputes or fights. Furthermore, existing datasets do not represent completely unconstrained cases of low resolution, high blur and large pose/occlusion variances. To this end, we introduce the Wildest Faces dataset, which focuses on such adverse effects through violent scenes. The dataset consists of an extensive set of violent scenes of celebrities from movies. Our experimental results demonstrate that state-of-the-art techniques are not well-suited for violent scenes, and therefore, Wildest Faces is likely to stir further interest in face detection and recognition research.

##### Abstract (translated by Google)
随着大规模数据集和能够学习复杂表示的深度学习模型的引入，人脸检测和识别任务中出现了令人印象深刻的进步。尽管取得了这样的进步，但现有的数据集并没有捕捉到最疯狂的场景中的面部识别困难，例如敌对纠纷或战斗。此外，现有数据集并不代表完全不受约束的低分辨率，高模糊和大的姿势/遮挡方差的情况。为此，我们介绍了Wildest Faces数据集，该数据集着重于暴力场景中的这些不利影响。该数据集包含一系列来自电影名人的暴力场景。我们的实验结果表明，最先进的技术不适合暴力场景，因此，Wildest Faces可能会激起人脸检测和识别研究的进一步兴趣。
