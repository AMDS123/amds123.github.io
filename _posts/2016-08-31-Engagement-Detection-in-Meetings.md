##### Abstract
Group meetings are frequent business events aimed to develop and conduct project work, such as Big Room design and construction project meetings. To be effective in these meetings, participants need to have an engaged mental state. The mental state of participants however, is hidden from other participants, and thereby difficult to evaluate. Mental state is understood as an inner process of thinking and feeling, that is formed of a conglomerate of mental representations and propositional attitudes. There is a need to create transparency of these hidden states to understand, evaluate and influence them. Facilitators need to evaluate the meeting situation and adjust for higher engagement and productivity. This paper presents a framework that defines a spectrum of engagement states and an array of classifiers aimed to detect the engagement state of participants in real time. The Engagement Framework integrates multi-modal information from 2D and 3D imaging and sound. Engagement is detected and evaluated at participants and aggregated at group level. We use empirical data collected at the lab of Konica Minolta, Inc. to test initial applications of this framework. The paper presents examples of the tested engagement classifiers, which are based on research in psychology, communication, and human computer interaction. Their accuracy is illustrated in dyadic interaction for engagement detection. In closing we discuss the potential extension to complex group collaboration settings and future feedback implementations.

##### Abstract (translated by Google)
小组会议是频繁的商业活动，旨在开展和执行项目工作，如大房间设计和建设项目会议。为了在这些会议中有效，参与者需要有一个精神状态。然而参与者的心理状态对其他参与者是隐藏的，因此难以评估。心理状态被理解为思维和情感的内在过程，它是由心理表征和命题态度组成的。有必要建立这些隐藏国家的透明度来了解，评估和影响他们。协助者需要评估会议情况并调整更高的参与度和生产力。本文提出了一个定义一系列参与状态的框架和一系列旨在实时检测参与者参与状态的分类器。参与框架集成了二维和三维成像和声音的多模态信息。参与者在参与者中被检测和评估，并在团队层面进行汇总。我们使用柯尼卡美能达实验室收集的经验数据来测试这个框架的初始应用。本文介绍了以心理学，交流和人机交互研究为基础的测试参与分类器的实例。它们的准确性在交互检测的二元交互中被说明。最后，我们将讨论对复杂的团队协作设置和将来的反馈实施的潜在扩展。
