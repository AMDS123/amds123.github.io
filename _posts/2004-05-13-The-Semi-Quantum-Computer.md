##### Abstract
We discuss the performance of the Search and Fourier Transform algorithms on a hybrid computer constituted of classical and quantum processors working together. We show that this semi-quantum computer would be an improvement over a pure classical architecture, no matter how few qubits are available and, therefore, it suggests an easier implementable technology than a pure quantum computer with arbitrary number of qubits.
