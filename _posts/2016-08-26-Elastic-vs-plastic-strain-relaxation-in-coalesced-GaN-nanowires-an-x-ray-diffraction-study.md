##### Abstract
The coalescence in dense arrays of spontaneously formed GaN nanowires proceeds by bundling: adjacent nanowires bend and merge at their top, thus reducing their surface energy at the expense of the elastic energy of bending. We give a theoretical description of the energetics of this bundling process. The bending energy is shown to be substantially reduced by the creation of dislocations at the coalescence joints. A comparison of experimental and calculated x-ray diffraction profiles from ensembles of bundled nanowires demonstrates that a large part of the bending energy is indeed relaxed by plastic deformation. The residual bending manifests itself by extended tails of the diffraction profiles.

自发形成的GaN纳米线的密集阵列中的聚结通过成束进行：邻近的纳米线在其顶部弯曲并合并，从而以弯曲的弹性能为代价降低它们的表面能。我们对这个捆绑过程的能量进行了理论描述。通过在聚结接头处产生位错，显示弯曲能量显着降低。从实验和计算的X射线衍射分布集束纳米线集合的比较表明，大部分的弯曲能量确实通过塑性变形来放松。残余的弯曲通过衍射轮廓的延长尾部表现出来。
