##### Abstract
Image is usually taken for expressing some kinds of emotions or purposes, such as love, celebrating Christmas. There is another better way that combines the image and relevant song to amplify the expression, which has drawn much attention in the social network recently. Hence, the automatic selection of songs should be expected. In this paper, we propose to retrieve semantic relevant songs just by an image query, which is named as the image2song problem. Motivated by the requirements of establishing correlation in semantic/content, we build a semantic-based song retrieval framework, which learns the correlation between image content and lyric words. This model uses a convolutional neural network to generate rich tags from image regions, a recurrent neural network to model lyric, and then establishes correlation via a multi-layer perceptron. To reduce the content gap between image and lyric, we propose to make the lyric modeling focus on the main image content via a tag attention. We collect a dataset from the social-sharing multimodal data to study the proposed problem, which consists of (image, music clip, lyric) triplets. We demonstrate that our proposed model shows noticeable results in the image2song retrieval task and provides suitable songs. Besides, the song2image task is also performed.

形象通常被用来表达某种情感或目的，比如爱，庆祝圣诞节。还有另外一种更好的结合图像和相关歌曲来扩大表情的方式，近来在社交网络上引起了很大的关注。因此，应该预期自动选择歌曲。在本文中，我们提出仅通过图像查询来检索语义相关歌曲，其被命名为image2song问题。基于语义/内容建立相关性的要求，构建了一个基于语义的歌曲检索框架，该框架学习了图像内容与歌词之间的相关性。该模型使用卷积神经网络从图像区域生成丰富的标签，用于对歌词进行建模的递归神经网络，然后通过多层感知器建立关联。为了减少图像与歌词之间的内容差距，我们建议通过标签注意将抒情模型集中在主要图像内容上。我们从社交共享多模态数据中收集数据集，研究提出的问题，它由（图像，音乐剪辑，歌词）三元组组成。我们证明我们提出的模型在image2song检索任务中显示出明显的结果并提供合适的歌曲。此外，song2image任务也执行。
