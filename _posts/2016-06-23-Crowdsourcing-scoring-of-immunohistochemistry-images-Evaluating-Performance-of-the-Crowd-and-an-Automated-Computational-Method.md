##### Abstract
The assessment of protein expression in immunohistochemistry (IHC) images provides important diagnostic, prognostic and predictive information for guiding cancer diagnosis and therapy. Manual scoring of IHC images represents a logistical challenge, as the process is labor intensive and time consuming. Since the last decade, computational methods have been developed to enable the application of quantitative methods for the analysis and interpretation of protein expression in IHC images. These methods have not yet replaced manual scoring for the assessment of IHC in the majority of diagnostic laboratories and in many large-scale research studies. An alternative approach is crowdsourcing the quantification of IHC images to an undefined crowd. The aim of this study is to quantify IHC images for labeling of ER status with two different crowdsourcing approaches, image labeling and nuclei labeling, and compare their performance with automated methods. Crowdsourcing-derived scores obtained greater concordance with the pathologist interpretations for both image labeling and nuclei labeling tasks (83% and 87%), as compared to the pathologist concordance achieved by the automated method (81%) on 5,483 TMA images from 1,909 breast cancer patients. This analysis shows that crowdsourcing the scoring of protein expression in IHC images is a promising new approach for large scale cancer molecular pathology studies.

免疫组织化学（IHC）图像中蛋白质表达的评估为指导癌症诊断和治疗提供了重要的诊断，预后和预测信息。 IHC图像的手动评分代表了后勤方面的挑战，因为该过程劳动强度大且耗时。自从上个十年以来，计算方法已经被开发出来，使得能够应用定量方法来分析和解释IHC图像中的蛋白质表达。在大多数诊断实验室和许多大规模的研究中，这些方法还没有取代手工评分来评估IHC。另一种方法是将量化的IHC图像众包给一个不确定的人群。这项研究的目的是定量IHC图像标记ER状态与两种不同众包方法，图像标记和核标签，并比较其性能与自动化方法。与来自1,909例乳腺癌的5,483张TMA图像的自动化方法所获得的病理学家一致性（81％）相比，源自众源的分数与病理学家对图像标记和核标记任务（83％和87％）的解释耐心。这一分析表明，众包IHC图像中蛋白质表达的评分是大规模癌症分子病理学研究的有希望的新方法。
