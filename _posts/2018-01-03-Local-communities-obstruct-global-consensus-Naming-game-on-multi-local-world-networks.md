##### Abstract
Community structure is essential for social communications, where individuals belonging to the same community are much more actively interacting and communicating with each other than those in different communities within the human society. Naming game, on the other hand, is a social communication model that simulates the process of learning a name of an object within a community of humans, where the individuals can generally reach global consensus asymptotically through iterative pair-wise conversations. The underlying network indicates the relationships among the individuals. In this paper, three typical topologies, namely random-graph, small-world and scale-free networks, are employed, which are embedded with the multi-local-world community structure, to study the naming game. Simulations show that 1) the convergence process to global consensus is getting slower as the community structure becomes more prominent, and eventually might fail; 2) if the inter-community connections are sufficiently dense, neither the number nor the size of the communities affects the convergence process; and 3) for different topologies with the same average node-degree, local clustering of individuals obstruct or prohibit global consensus to take place. The results reveal the role of local communities in a global naming game in social network studies.

##### Abstract (translated by Google)
社区结构对社交沟通至关重要，属于同一个社区的个人比人类社会中不同社区的个人更积极互动和交流。另一方面，命名游戏是一种社会交际模式，它模拟人类社区内学习对象名称的过程，通过反复的成对对话，个体通常可以渐近地达成全球共识。底层网络表明了个人之间的关系。本文采用随机图，小世界和无标度网络三种典型拓扑结构，嵌入多本地社区结构，研究命名游戏。模拟结果表明：（1）随着社区结构变得更加突出，全球共识的趋同进程越来越慢，最终可能会失败。 2）如果社区间的连接密集，社区的数量和规模都不会影响到融合过程; 3）对于具有相同平均节点度的不同拓扑结构，个体的局部聚类阻碍或禁止全球共识发生。结果揭示了当地社区在社交网络研究中的全球命名游戏中的作用。
