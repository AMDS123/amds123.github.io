##### Abstract
The wide field of view (WFV) imaging system onboard the Chinese GaoFen-1 (GF-1) optical satellite has a 16-m resolution and four-day revisit cycle for large-scale Earth observation. The advantages of the high temporal-spatial resolution and the wide field of view make the GF-1 WFV imagery very popular. However, cloud cover is an inevitable problem in GF-1 WFV imagery, which influences its precise application. Accurate cloud and cloud shadow detection in GF-1 WFV imagery is quite difficult due to the fact that there are only three visible bands and one near-infrared band. In this paper, an automatic multi-feature combined (MFC) method is proposed for cloud and cloud shadow detection in GF-1 WFV imagery. The MFC algorithm first implements threshold segmentation based on the spectral features and mask refinement based on guided filtering to generate a preliminary cloud mask. The geometric features are then used in combination with the texture features to improve the cloud detection results and produce the final cloud mask. Finally, the cloud shadow mask can be acquired by means of the cloud and shadow matching and follow-up correction process. The method was validated using 108 globally distributed scenes. The results indicate that MFC performs well under most conditions, and the average overall accuracy of MFC cloud detection is as high as 96.8%. In the contrastive analysis with the official provided cloud fractions, MFC shows a significant improvement in cloud fraction estimation, and achieves a high accuracy for the cloud and cloud shadow detection in the GF-1 WFV imagery with fewer spectral bands. The proposed method could be used as a preprocessing step in the future to monitor land-cover change, and it could also be easily extended to other optical satellite imagery which has a similar spectral setting.

中国高飞1号（GF-1）光学卫星的宽视场（WFV）成像系统具有16米的分辨率和4天的大规模地球观测重访周期。高时空分辨率和宽视野的优势使GF-1 WFV图像非常流行。然而，云层覆盖是GF-1 WFV影像中不可避免的问题，影响其精确应用。由于只有三个可见光波段和一个近红外波段，所以在GF-1 WFV图像中精确的云层和云层阴影检测相当困难。本文提出了一种自动多特征组合（MFC）方法，用于GF-1 WFV图像中的云和云阴影检测。 MFC算法首先基于光谱特征和基于引导过滤的掩模细化实现阈值分割以生成初步云遮罩。然后将几何特征与纹理特征结合使用以改善云检测结果并产生最终的云遮罩。最后通过云阴影匹配和后续校正过程获得云阴影掩膜。该方法使用108个全局分布的场景进行验证。结果表明，MFC在大多数情况下表现良好，MFC云检测的整体平均精度高达96.8％。在与官方提供的云分数的对比分析中，MFC显示出云分数估计的显着改进，并且对于具有较少光谱带的GF-1 WFV图像中的云和云阴影检测实现了高精度。所提出的方法可以作为未来预处理步骤来监测土地覆盖变化，也可以很容易地扩展到其他具有相似光谱设置的光学卫星图像。
