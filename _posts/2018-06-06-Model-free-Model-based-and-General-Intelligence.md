##### Abstract
During the 60s and 70s, AI researchers explored intuitions about intelligence by writing programs that displayed intelligent behavior. Many good ideas came out from this work but programs written by hand were not robust or general. After the 80s, research increasingly shifted to the development of learners capable of inferring behavior and functions from experience and data, and solvers capable of tackling well-defined but intractable models like SAT, classical planning, Bayesian networks, and POMDPs. The learning approach has achieved considerable success but results in black boxes that do not have the flexibility, transparency, and generality of their model-based counterparts. Model-based approaches, on the other hand, require models and scalable algorithms. Model-free learners and model-based solvers have close parallels with Systems 1 and 2 in current theories of the human mind: the first, a fast, opaque, and inflexible intuitive mind; the second, a slow, transparent, and flexible analytical mind. In this paper, I review developments in AI and draw on these theories to discuss the gap between model-free learners and model-based solvers, a gap that needs to be bridged in order to have intelligent systems that are robust and general.

##### Abstract (translated by Google)
在60年代和70年代，人工智能研究人员通过编写显示智能行为的程序探索了关于智力的直觉。这项工作产生了许多好的想法，但用手写的程序不够健壮或一般。 80年代以后，研究越来越多地转向能够从经验和数据中推断行为和功能的学习者的发展，并且解决者能够处理像SAT，经典计划，贝叶斯网络和POMDP这样定义明确但棘手的模型。这种学习方法取得了相当大的成功，但却导致黑盒子没有灵活性，透明度和基于模型的同行的普遍性。另一方面，基于模型的方法需要模型和可扩展算法。无模型学习者和基于模型的求解器与当前人类心智理论中的系统1和2紧密相关：第一种，快速，不透明和不灵活的直觉思维;第二，缓慢，透明和灵活的分析思维。在本文中，我回顾了人工智能的发展，并利用这些理论来讨论无模型学习者和基于模型的求解器之间的差距，为了使智能系统具有强大而通用的特性，需要缩小差距。
