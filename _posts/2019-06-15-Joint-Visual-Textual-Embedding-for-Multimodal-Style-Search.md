##### Abstract
We introduce a multimodal visual-textual search refinement method for fashion garments. Existing search engines do not enable intuitive, interactive, refinement of retrieved results based on the properties of a particular product. We propose a method to retrieve similar items, based on a query item image and textual refinement properties. We believe this method can be leveraged to solve many real-life customer scenarios, in which a similar item in a different color, pattern, length or style is desired. We employ a joint embedding training scheme in which product images and their catalog textual metadata are mapped closely in a shared space. This joint visual-textual embedding space enables manipulating catalog images semantically, based on textual refinement requirements. We propose a new training objective function, Mini-Batch Match Retrieval, and demonstrate its superiority over the commonly used triplet loss. Additionally, we demonstrate the feasibility of adding an attribute extraction module, trained on the same catalog data, and demonstrate how to integrate it within the multimodal search to boost its performance. We introduce an evaluation protocol with an associated benchmark, and compare several approaches.
