##### Abstract
Gait and static body measurement are important biometric technologies for passive human recognition. Many previous works argue that recognition performance based completely on the gait feature is limited. The reason for this limited performance remains unclear. This study focuses on human recognition with gait feature obtained by Kinect and shows that gait feature can effectively distinguish from different human beings through a novel representation -- relative distance-based gait features. Experimental results show that the recognition accuracy with relative distance features reaches up to 85%, which is comparable with that of anthropometric features. The combination of relative distance features and anthropometric features can provide an accuracy of more than 95%. Results indicate that the relative distance feature is quite effective and worthy of further study in more general scenarios (e.g., without Kinect).

步态和静态身体测量是被动式人体识别的重要生物识别技术。许多以前的作品认为完全基于步态特征的识别性能是有限的。这种有限的表现的原因尚不清楚。本文以Kinect获得的步态特征为研究对象，通过一种新颖的表征 - 相对距离步态特征，可以有效区分不同人的步态特征。实验结果表明，相对距离特征的识别精度可达85％，与人体测量特征相当。相对距离特征和人体测量特征的组合可以提供超过95％的准确度。结果表明，相对距离特征是相当有效的，值得在更一般的情况下进一步研究（例如，没有Kinect）。
