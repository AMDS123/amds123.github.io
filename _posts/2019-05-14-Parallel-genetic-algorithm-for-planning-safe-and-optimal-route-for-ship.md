##### Abstract
The paper represents an algorithm for planning safe and optimal routes for transport facilities with unrestricted movement direction that travel within areas with obstacles. Paper explains the algorithm using a ship as an example of such a transport facility. This paper also provides a survey of several existing solutions for the problem. The method employs an evolutionary algorithm to plan several locally optimal routes and a parallel genetic algorithm to create the final route by optimising the abovementioned set of routes. The routes are optimized against the arrival time, assuming that the optimal route is the route with the lowermost arrival time. It is also possible to apply additional restriction to the routes.
