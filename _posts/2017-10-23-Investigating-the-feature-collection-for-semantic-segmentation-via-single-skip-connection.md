##### Abstract
Since the study of deep convolutional neural network became prevalent, one of the important discoveries is that a feature map from a convolutional network can be extracted before going into the fully connected layer and can be used as a saliency map for object detection. Furthermore, the model can use features from each different layer for accurate object detection: the features from different layers can have different properties. As the model goes deeper, it has many latent skip connections and feature maps to elaborate object detection. Although there are many intermediate layers that we can use for semantic segmentation through skip connection, still the characteristics of each skip connection and the best skip connection for this task are uncertain. Therefore, in this study, we exhaustively research skip connections of state-of-the-art deep convolutional networks and investigate the characteristics of the features from each intermediate layer. In addition, this study would suggest how to use a recent deep neural network model for semantic segmentation and it would therefore become a cornerstone for later studies with the state-of-the-art network models.

由于深度卷积神经网络的研究越来越普遍，重要的发现之一是卷积网络的特征映射可以在进入完全连通层之前被提取出来，并且可以被用作物体检测的显着图。此外，该模型可以使用来自每个不同层的特征来进行精确的对象检测：来自不同层的特征可以具有不同的属性。随着模型的深入，它有许多潜在的跳跃连接和特征映射来详细阐述对象检测。尽管我们可以通过跳过连接来进行语义分割，但是每个跳转连接的特征和跳转连接都是不确定的。因此，在本研究中，我们详尽地研究了最先进的深度卷积网络的跳过连接，并研究了每个中间层的特征特征。此外，这项研究将建议如何使用最近的深度神经网络模型进行语义分割，因此将成为今后使用最先进的网络模型进行研究的基石。
