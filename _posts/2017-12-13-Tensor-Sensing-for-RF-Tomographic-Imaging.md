##### Abstract
Radio-frequency (RF) tomographic imaging is a promising technique for inferring multi-dimensional physical space by processing RF signals traversed across a region of interest. However, conventional RF tomography schemes are generally based on vector compressed sensing, which ignores the geometric structures of the target spaces and leads to low recovery precision. The recently proposed transform-based tensor model is more appropriate for sensory data processing, which helps exploit the geometric structures of the three-dimensional target and increases the recovery precision. In this paper, we propose a novel tensor sensing approach that achieves highly accurate estimation for real-world three-dimensional spaces. Firstly, we use the transform-based tensor model to formulate the RF tomographic imaging as a tensor sensing problem, and propose a fast alternating minimization algorithm called Alt-Min. Secondly, a detailed routine to carry out the algorithm is given, moreover, we propose a key optimization which resolves the huge memory consumption and long computation time problems. Finally, we present an evaluation of our Alt-Min approach using IKEA 3D data and demonstrate significant improvement in recovery error and convergence speed compared to prior tensor-based compressed sensing.

射频（RF）层析成像是用于通过处理遍及感兴趣区域的RF信号来推断多维物理空间的有希望的技术。然而，传统的射频层析成像方法一般是基于矢量压缩感知，忽略了目标空间的几何结构，导致恢复精度低。最近提出的基于变换的张量模型更适合于传感数据处理，有助于开发三维目标的几何结构，提高恢复精度。在本文中，我们提出了一种新颖的张量感知方法，实现高度准确的估计真实世界的三维空间。首先，利用基于变换的张量模型将射线断层扫描成像作为张量检测问题，提出了一种快速交替最小化算法Alt-Min。其次给出了执行该算法的详细流程，并提出了解决内存消耗大，计算时间长的问题的关键优化问题。最后，我们使用IKEA 3D数据提出对Alt-Min方法的评估，并证明与先前的基于张量的压缩感测相比，​​恢复误差和收敛速度显着提高。
