##### Abstract
Video surveillance always had a negative connotation, among others because of the loss of privacy and because it may not automatically increase public safety. If it was able to detect atypical (i.e. dangerous) situations in real time, autonomously and anonymously, this could change. A prerequisite for this is a reliable automatic detection of possibly dangerous situations from video data. This is done classically by object extraction and tracking. From the derived trajectories, we then want to determine dangerous situations by detecting atypical trajectories. However, due to ethical considerations it is better to develop such a system on data without people being threatened or even harmed, plus with having them know that there is such a tracking system installed. Another important point is that these situations do not occur very often in real, public CCTV areas and may be captured properly even less. In the artistic project leave a trace the tracked objects, people in an atrium of a institutional building, become actor and thus part of the installation. Visualisation in real-time allows interaction by these actors, which in turn creates many atypical interaction situations on which we can develop our situation detection. The data set has evolved over three years and hence, is huge. In this article we describe the tracking system and several approaches for the detection of atypical trajectories.

##### Abstract (translated by Google)
视频监控总是有一个负面的含义，其中之一就是因为隐私的丧失，并不能自动增加公共安全。如果能够实时，自主和匿名地检测到非典型（即危险）的情况，这可能会改变。一个先决条件是从视频数据可靠的自动检测可能的危险情况。这是通过对象提取和跟踪经典地完成的。从导出的轨迹，我们然后想要通过检测非典型的轨迹来确定危险的情况。但是，出于伦理的考虑，最好是在没有人受到威胁甚至伤害的情况下开发这样一个数据系统，并且让他们知道安装了这样一个跟踪系统。另一个重要的问题是，这些情况在真实的公共闭路电视频道中并不经常出现，甚至可能被更好地俘虏。在艺术项目中留下追踪的对象，在一个机构建筑的中庭里的人，成为演员，从而成为装置的一部分。实时可视化允许这些参与者进行交互，这反过来又产生了许多非典型的交互情境，我们可以在这些情境中发展我们的情境检测。数据集已经发展了三年，因此是巨大的。在这篇文章中，我们描述了跟踪系统和检测非典型轨迹的几种方法。
