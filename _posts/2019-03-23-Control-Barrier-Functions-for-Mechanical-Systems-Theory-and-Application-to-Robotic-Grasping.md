##### Abstract
Control barrier functions have been demonstrated to be a useful method of ensuring constraint satisfaction for a wide class of controllers, however existing results are mostly restricted to continuous time systems of relative degree one. Mechanical systems, including robots, are typically second-order systems in which the control occurs at the force/torque level. These systems have velocity and position constraints (i.e. relative degree two) that are vital for safety and/or task execution. Additionally, mechanical systems are typically controlled digitally as sampled-data systems. The contribution of this work is two-fold. First, is the development of novel, robust control barrier functions that ensure constraint satisfaction for relative degree two, sampled-data systems in the presence of model uncertainty. Second, is the application of the proposed method to the challenging problem of robotic grasping in which a robotic hand must ensure an object remains inside the grasp while manipulating it to a desired reference trajectory. A grasp constraint satisfying controller is proposed that can admit existing nominal manipulation controllers from the literature, while simultaneously ensuring no slip, no over-extension (e.g. singular configurations), and no rolling off of the fingertips. Simulation and experimental results validate the proposed control for the robotic hand application.
