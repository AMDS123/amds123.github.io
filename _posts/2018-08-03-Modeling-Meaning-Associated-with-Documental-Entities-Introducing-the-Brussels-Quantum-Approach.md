##### Abstract
We show that the Brussels operational-realistic approach to quantum physics and quantum cognition offers a fundamental strategy for modeling the meaning associated with collections of documental entities. To do so, we take the World Wide Web as a paradigmatic example and emphasize the importance of distinguishing the Web, made of printed documents, from a more abstract meaning entity, which we call the Quantum Web, or QWeb, where the former is considered to be the collection of traces that can be left by the latter, in specific measurements, similarly to how a non-spatial quantum entity, like an electron, can leave localized traces of impact on a detection screen. The double-slit experiment is extensively used to illustrate the rationale of the modeling, which is guided by how physicists constructed quantum theory to describe the behavior of the microscopic entities. We also emphasize that the superposition principle and the associated interference effects are not sufficient to model all experimental probabilistic data, like those obtained by counting the relative number of documents containing certain words and co-occurrences of words. For this, additional effects, like context effects, must also be taken into consideration.

我们表明，布鲁塞尔对量子物理学和量子认知的操作实际方法提供了一种基本策略，用于建模与文献实体集合相关的含义。为此，我们将万维网作为范例，并强调将由打印文档组成的Web与更抽象的含义实体（我们称之为Quantum Web或QWeb）区分开来的重要性，其中前者被认为是在特定测量中，可以由后者留下的迹线的集合，类似于非空间量子实体（如电子）如何在检测屏幕上留下局部的影响痕迹。双缝实验被广泛用于说明建模的基本原理，这是由物理学家如何构建量子理论来描述微观实体的行为。我们还强调，叠加原理和相关的干扰效应不足以模拟所有实验概率数据，例如通过计算包含某些单词和单词共现的文档的相对数量而获得的数据。为此，还必须考虑其他影响，如背景效应。
