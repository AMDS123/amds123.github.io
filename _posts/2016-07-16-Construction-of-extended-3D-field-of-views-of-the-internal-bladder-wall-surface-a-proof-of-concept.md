##### Abstract
3D extended field of views (FOVs) of the internal bladder wall facilitate lesion diagnosis, patient follow-up and treatment traceability. In this paper, we propose a 3D image mosaicing algorithm guided by 2D cystoscopic video-image registration for obtaining textured FOV mosaics. In this feasibility study, the registration makes use of data from a 3D cystoscope prototype providing, in addition to each small FOV image, some 3D points located on the surface. This proof of concept shows that textured surfaces can be constructed with minimally modified cystoscopes. The potential of the method is demonstrated on numerical and real phantoms reproducing various surface shapes. Pig and human bladder textures are superimposed on phantoms with known shape and dimensions. These data allow for quantitative assessment of the 3D mosaicing algorithm based on the registration of images simulating bladder textures.

内部膀胱壁的3D扩展视野（FOV）便于病变诊断，患者随访和治疗追踪。在本文中，我们提出了一种二维膀胱镜视频图像配准的三维图像拼接算法来获取纹理视野马赛克。在此可行性研究中，注册使用3D膀胱镜原型的数据，除了每个小视场图像之外，还提供位于表面上的一些3D点。这个概念验证表明，纹理表面可以用最小修改的膀胱镜来构造。该方法的潜力在数字和真实的模型上演示了不同的表面形状。猪和人的膀胱纹理叠加在已知形状和尺寸的幻影上。这些数据允许基于模拟膀胱纹理的图像的配准对3D镶嵌算法进行定量评估。
