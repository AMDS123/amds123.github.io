##### Abstract
Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have received increasing attention over the last few years. They were initially conceived for image categorization, i.e., the problem of assigning a semantic label to an entire input image. In this paper we address the problem of dense semantic labeling, which consists in assigning a semantic label to every pixel in an image. Since this requires a high spatial accuracy to determine where labels are assigned, categorization CNNs, intended to be highly robust to local deformations, are not directly applicable. By adapting categorization networks, many semantic labeling CNNs have been recently proposed. Our first contribution is an in-depth analysis of these architectures. We establish the desired properties of an ideal semantic labeling CNN, and assess how those methods stand with regard to these properties. We observe that even though they provide competitive results, these CNNs often underexploit properties of semantic labeling that could lead to more effective and efficient architectures. Out of these observations, we then derive a CNN framework specifically adapted to the semantic labeling problem. In addition to learning features at different resolutions, it learns how to combine these features. By integrating local and global information in an efficient and flexible manner, it outperforms previous techniques. We evaluate the proposed framework and compare it with state-of-the-art architectures on public benchmarks of high-resolution aerial image labeling.

卷积神经网络（CNN）在过去几年受到越来越多的关注。它们最初被设计用于图像分类，即将语义标签分配给整个输入图像的问题。在本文中，我们解决了密集语义标注的问题，即为图像中的每个像素分配一个语义标签。由于这需要高的空间精度来确定标签的分配位置，所以对局部变形高度稳健的分类CNN不能直接应用。通过适应分类网络，最近已经提出了许多语义标注CNN。我们的第一个贡献是对这些体系结构的深入分析。我们建立理想的语义标注CNN的期望属性，并评估这些方法在这些属性方面的表现。我们观察到，尽管它们提供了有竞争力的结果，但是这些CNN经常对语义标注的属性进行不足的挖掘，从而导致更有效的架构。在这些观察中，我们然后推导了一个特别适用于语义标签问题的CNN框架。除了学习不同分辨率的功能外，它还学习如何组合这些功能。通过高效灵活地整合本地和全球信息，它胜过以前的技术。我们评估提出的框架，并将其与高分辨率航空图像标签的公共基准的最新架构进行比较。
