##### Abstract
This paper presents the first two editions of Visual Doom AI Competition, held in 2016 and 2017. The challenge was to create bots that compete in a multi-player deathmatch in a first-person shooter (FPS) game, Doom. The bots had to make their decisions based solely on visual information, i.e., a raw screen buffer. To play well, the bots needed to understand their surroundings, navigate, explore, and handle the opponents at the same time. These aspects, together with the competitive multi-agent aspect of the game, make the competition a unique platform for evaluating the state of the art reinforcement learning algorithms. The paper discusses the rules, solutions, results, and statistics that give insight into the agents' behaviors. Best-performing agents are described in more detail. The results of the competition lead to the conclusion that, although reinforcement learning can produce capable Doom bots, they still are not yet able to successfully compete against humans in this game. The paper also revisits the ViZDoom environment, which is a flexible, easy to use, and efficient 3D platform for research for vision-based reinforcement learning, based on a well-recognized first-person perspective game Doom.

本文介绍了2016年和2017年举办的Visual Doom AI竞赛的前两个版本。面临的挑战是在第一人称射击游戏（Doom）中创建一个参与多玩家死亡竞赛的机器人。机器人必须仅基于视觉信息（即原始屏幕缓冲区）做出决定。为了好好玩，机器人需要同时了解周围环境，导航，探索和处理对手。这些方面以及游戏的竞争性多智能体方面使竞争成为评估最新技术强化学习算法的独特平台。本文讨论了可以深入了解代理行为的规则，解决方案，结果和统计数据。更详细地描述了性能最佳的代理。比赛的结果得出的结论是，虽然强化学习可以产生有能力的末日机器人，但在这场比赛中他们仍然无法成功地与人类竞争。本文还重新审视了ViZDoom环境，这是一个灵活，易用，高效的3D平台，用于基于视觉的强化学习研究，基于公认的第一人称视角游戏Doom。
