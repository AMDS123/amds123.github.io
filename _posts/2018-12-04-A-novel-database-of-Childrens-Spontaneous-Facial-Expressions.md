##### Abstract
The computing environment is moving towards human-centered designs instead of computer centered designs and human's tend to communicate wealth of information through affective states or expressions. Traditional Human Computer Interaction based systems ignores bulk of information communicated through those affective states and just caters for user's intentional input. Generally, for evaluating and benchmarking different facial expression analysis algorithms, standardized databases are needed to enable a meaningful comparison. In the absence of comparative tests on such standardized databases it is difficult to find relative strengths and weaknesses of different facial expression recognition algorithms. Recording truly spontaneous instances of basic emotion expressions is extremely difficult, because in everyday life the basic emotions are not shown frequently. However, when they are displayed, they convey a very strong message to someone's surroundings. 
 In this article we presented novel database for Children's Spontaneous facial Expressions (LIRIS-CSE). The database contains six universal spontaneous facial expressions shown by 12 ethnically diverse children between the ages of 6 and 12 years with mean age of 7.3 years. To the best of our knowledge, this database is first of its kind as it records and shows six universal spontaneous facial expressions of children. Previously there were few database of children expressions and all of them show posed or exaggerated expressions which are different from spontaneous or natural expressions. Thus, this database will be a milestone for human behavior researchers. This database will be a excellent resource for vision community for benchmarking and comparing results.
