##### Abstract
Term weighting metrics assign weights to terms in order to discriminate the important terms from the less crucial ones. Due to this characteristic, these metrics have attracted growing attention in text classification and recently in sentiment analysis. Using the weights given by such metrics could lead to more accurate document representation which may improve the performance of the classification. While previous studies have focused on proposing or comparing different weighting metrics at two-classes document level sentiment analysis, this study propose to analyse the results given by each metric in order to find out the characteristics of good and bad weighting metrics. Therefore we present an empirical study of fifteen global supervised weighting metrics with four local weighting metrics adopted from information retrieval, we also give an analysis to understand the behavior of each metric by observing and analysing how each metric distributes the terms and deduce some characteristics which may distinguish the good and bad metrics. The evaluation has been done using Support Vector Machine on three different datasets: Twitter, restaurant and laptop reviews.

术语加权指标为术语分配权重，以便将重要术语与不太重要的术语区分开来。由于这个特点，这些指标在文本分类和最近的情感分析中引起了越来越多的关注。使用这些度量给出的权重可以导致更准确的文档表示，这可以提高分类的性能。虽然以前的研究集中在提出或比较两类文档级情感分析的不同加权指标，本研究提出分析每个指标给出的结果，以找出好的和不好的指标的特征。因此，我们通过从信息检索中采用四种局部加权指标，给出了十五个全局监督加权指标的实证研究，并通过观察和分析每个指标如何分配条件和推导出一些特征来分析每个指标的行为区分好坏指标。使用支持向量机在三个不同的数据集上进行了评估：Twitter，餐厅和笔记本评论。
