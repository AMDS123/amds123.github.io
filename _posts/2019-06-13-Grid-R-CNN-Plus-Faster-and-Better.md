##### Abstract
Grid R-CNN is a well-performed objection detection framework. It transforms the traditional box offset regression problem into a grid point estimation problem. With the guidance of the grid points, it can obtain high-quality localization results. However, the speed of Grid R-CNN is not so satisfactory. In this technical report we present Grid R-CNN Plus, a better and faster version of Grid R-CNN. We have made several updates that significantly speed up the framework and simultaneously improve the accuracy. On COCO dataset, the Res50-FPN based Grid R-CNN Plus detector achieves an mAP of 40.4%, outperforming the baseline on the same model by 3.0 points with similar inference time. Code is available at this https URL .
