##### Abstract
Aspect and opinion terms extraction from review texts is one of the key tasks in aspect-based sentiment analysis. In order to extract aspect and opinion terms for Indonesian hotel reviews, we adapt double embeddings feature and attention mechanism that outperform the best system at SemEval 2015 and 2016. We conduct experiments using 4000 reviews to find the best configuration and show the influences of double embeddings and attention mechanism toward model performance. Using 1000 reviews for evaluation, we achieved F1-measure of 0.914 and 0.90 for aspect and opinion terms extraction in token and entity (term) level respectively.
