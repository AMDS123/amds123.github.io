##### Abstract
This paper presents the Intelligent Voice (IV) system submitted to the NIST 2016 Speaker Recognition Evaluation (SRE). The primary emphasis of SRE this year was on developing speaker recognition technology which is robust for novel languages that are much more heterogeneous than those used in the current state-of-the-art, using significantly less training data, that does not contain meta-data from those languages. The system is based on the state-of-the-art i-vector/PLDA which is developed on the fixed training condition, and the results are reported on the protocol defined on the development set of the challenge.

本文介绍了提交给NIST 2016演讲嘉宾评估（SRE）的智能语音（IV）系统。 SRE今年的主要重点是开发说话人识别技术，这种技术对于新颖的语言来说是强大的，这种语言比当前最先进的语言更加异类，使用的训练数据少得多，不含元数据，来自这些语言的数据。该系统基于在固定训练条件下开发的最先进的i矢量/ PLDA，并且将结果报告给在挑战的开发集上定义的协议。
