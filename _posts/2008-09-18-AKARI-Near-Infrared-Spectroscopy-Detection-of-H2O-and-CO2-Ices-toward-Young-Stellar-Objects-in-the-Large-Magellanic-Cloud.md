##### Abstract
We present the first results of AKARI Infrared Camera near-infrared spec- troscopic survey of the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC). We detected absorption features of the H2O ice 3.05 um and the CO2 ice 4.27 um stretching mode toward seven massive young stellar objects (YSOs). These samples are for the first time spectroscopically confirmed to be YSOs. We used a curve-of-growth method to evaluate the column densities of the ices and derived the CO2/H2O ratio to be 0.45 pm 0.17. This is clearly higher than that seen in Galactic massive YSOs (0.17 pm 0.03). We suggest that the strong ultraviolet radiation field and/or the high dust temperature in the LMC may be responsible for the observed high CO2 ice abundance.
