##### Abstract
Feature or interest points typically use information aggregation in 2D patches which does not remain stable at object boundaries when there is object motion against a significantly varying background. Level or iso-intensity curves are much more stable under such conditions, especially the longer ones. In this paper, we identify stable portions on long iso-curves and detect corners on them. Further, the iso-curve associated with a corner is used to discard portions from the background and improve matching. Such CoMIC (Corners on Maximally-stable Iso-intensity Curves) points yield superior results at the object boundary regions compared to state-of-the-art detectors while performing comparably at the interior regions as well. This is illustrated in exhaustive matching experiments for both boundary and non-boundary regions in applications such as stereo and point tracking for structure from motion in video sequences.

##### Abstract (translated by Google)
特征或兴趣点通常使用2D贴片中的信息聚合，当对象运动针对明显变化的背景时，其在对象边界处不保持稳定。水平或等强度曲线在这样的条件下更稳定，特别是较长的曲线。在本文中，我们确定长等时线上的稳定部分并检测它们上的拐角。此外，使用与拐角相关的等曲线来丢弃背景中的部分并改善匹配。与最先进的检测器相比，这种CoMIC（最大稳定等强度曲线上的角）点在物体边界区域产生优越的结果，同时在内部区域也表现相当。这在用于边界和非边界区域的详尽的匹配实验中进行了说明，例如视频序列中运动的结构的立体和点跟踪。
