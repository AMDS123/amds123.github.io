##### Abstract
Cluster analysis has become one of the most exercised research areas over the past few decades in computer science. As a consequence, numerous clustering algorithms have already been developed to find appropriate partitions of a set of objects. Given multiple such clustering solutions, it is a challenging task to obtain an ensemble of these solutions. This becomes more challenging when the ground truth about the number of clusters is unavailable. In this paper, we introduce a crowd-powered model to collect solutions of image clustering from the general crowd and pose it as a clustering ensemble problem with variable number of clusters. The varying number of clusters basically reflects the crowd workers' perspective toward a particular set of objects. We allow a set of crowd workers to independently cluster the images as per their perceptions. We address the problem by finding out centroid of the clusters using an appropriate distance measure and prioritize the likelihood of similarity of the individual cluster sets. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated by applying it on multiple artificial datasets obtained from crowd.

聚类分析已经成为计算机科学在过去几十年中运用最多的研究领域之一。因此，已经开发了许多聚类算法来找到一组对象的适当分区。给定多个这样的聚类解决方案，获得这些解决方案的集合是一个具有挑战性的任务。当关于群集数量的基本事实不可用时，这变得更具挑战性。在本文中，我们引入一个人群驱动的模型来收集来自普通人群的图像聚类解决方案，并将其作为具有可变数目聚类的聚类集成问题。群集数量的不同基本上反映了群众对特定对象的看法。我们允许一群拥挤的工作人员根据他们的看法独立地聚集图像。我们通过使用适当的距离测量来找出聚类的质心并且优先考虑单个聚类集合的相似性的可能性来解决该问题。所提出的方法的有效性通过将其应用于从人群中获得的多个人造数据集来证明。
