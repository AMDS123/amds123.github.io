##### Abstract
Recently, a variety of approaches has been enriching the field of Remote Sensing (RS) image processing and analysis. Unfortunately, existing methods remain limited faced to the rich spatio-spectral content of today's large datasets. It would seem intriguing to resort to Deep Learning (DL) based approaches at this stage with regards to their ability to offer accurate semantic interpretation of the data. However, the specificity introduced by the coexistence of spectral and spatial content in the RS datasets widens the scope of the challenges presented to adapt DL methods to these contexts. Therefore, the aim of this paper is firstly to explore the performance of DL architectures for the RS hyperspectral dataset classification and secondly to introduce a new three-dimensional DL approach that enables a joint spectral and spatial information process. A set of three-dimensional schemes is proposed and evaluated. Experimental results based on well knownhyperspectral datasets demonstrate that the proposed method is able to achieve a better classification rate than state of the art methods with lower computational costs.

最近，各种方法一直在丰富遥感（RS）图像处理和分析领域。不幸的是，现有的方法在当今大型数据集的丰富空间谱内容方面仍然有限。在这个阶段采用基于深度学习（DL）的方法对于它们提供数据的精确语义解释的能力似乎很有趣。然而，由RS数据集中光谱和空间内容共存引入的特异性拓宽了将DL方法适用于这些情境的挑战的范围。因此，本文的目的首先是探索DL高光谱数据集分类的DL体系结构的性能，其次是介绍一种新的三维DL方法，实现联合光谱和空间信息处理。提出并评估一组三维方案。基于众所周知的高光谱数据集的实验结果表明，所提出的方法能够获得比现有技术方法更好的分类率，并且计算成本更低。
