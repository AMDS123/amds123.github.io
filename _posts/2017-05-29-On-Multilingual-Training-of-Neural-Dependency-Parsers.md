##### Abstract
We show that a recently proposed neural dependency parser can be improved by joint training on multiple languages from the same family. The parser is implemented as a deep neural network whose only input is orthographic representations of words. In order to successfully parse, the network has to discover how linguistically relevant concepts can be inferred from word spellings. We analyze the representations of characters and words that are learned by the network to establish which properties of languages were accounted for. In particular we show that the parser has approximately learned to associate Latin characters with their Cyrillic counterparts and that it can group Polish and Russian words that have a similar grammatical function. Finally, we evaluate the parser on selected languages from the Universal Dependencies dataset and show that it is competitive with other recently proposed state-of-the art methods, while having a simple structure.

我们表明，最近提出的神经依赖解析器可以通过从同一个家族的多种语言的联合训练来改进。解析器被实现为深度神经网络，其唯一的输入是字的正交表示。为了成功解析，网络必须发现如何从单词拼写中推断与语言相关的概念。我们分析网络学习的字符和词语的表示，以确定哪些语言属性被考虑在内。特别是我们显示，解析器已经大致学会将拉丁字符与他们的西里尔语对应关联起来，并且可以将具有类似语法功能的波兰语和俄语单词分组。最后，我们从Universal Dependencies数据集中选择语言来评估解析器，并显示出它与其他最近提出的最先进的方法相比具有竞争力，同时具有简单的结构。
