##### Abstract
Recently, multi-view representation learning has become a rapidly growing direction in machine learning and data mining areas. This paper introduces two categories for multi-view representation learning: multi-view representation alignment and multi-view representation fusion. Consequently, we first review the representative methods and theories of multi-view representation learning based on the perspective of alignment, such as correlation-based alignment. Representative examples are canonical correlation analysis (CCA) and its several extensions. Then from the perspective of representation fusion we investigate the advancement of multi-view representation learning that ranges from generative methods including multi-modal topic learning, multi-view sparse coding, and multi-view latent space Markov networks, to neural network-based methods including multi-modal autoencoders, multi-view convolutional neural networks, and multi-modal recurrent neural networks. Further, we also investigate several important applications of multi-view representation learning. Overall, this survey aims to provide an insightful overview of theoretical foundation and state-of-the-art developments in the field of multi-view representation learning and to help researchers find the most appropriate tools for particular applications.
