##### Abstract
Estimation of the number of endmembers existing in a scene constitutes a critical task in the hyperspectral unmixing process. The accuracy of this estimate plays a crucial role in subsequent unsupervised unmixing steps i.e., the derivation of the spectral signatures of the endmembers (endmembers' extraction) and the estimation of the abundance fractions of the pixels. A common practice amply followed in literature is to treat endmembers' number estimation and unmixing, independently as two separate tasks, providing the outcome of the former as input to the latter. In this paper, we go beyond this computationally demanding strategy. More precisely, we set forth a multiple constrained optimization framework, which encapsulates endmembers' number estimation and unsupervised unmixing in a single task. This is attained by suitably formulating the problem via a low-rank and sparse nonnegative matrix factorization rationale, where low-rankness is promoted with the use of a sophisticated $\ell_2/\ell_1$ norm penalty term. An alternating proximal algorithm is then proposed for minimizing the emerging cost function. The results obtained by simulated and real data experiments verify the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

估计场景中存在的端元数量是高光谱分解过程中的关键任务。该估计的准确性在随后的无监督解混步骤（即，端元光谱特征的推导（端元提取）和像素的丰度分数的估计）中起关键作用。文献中普遍采用的做法是把成员数量的估算和解混作为两个独立的任务来进行，把前者的结果作为后者的输入。在本文中，我们超越了这种计算要求很高的策略。更准确地说，我们提出了一个多重约束优化框架，它将端元数量估计和无监督解混合封装在一个任务中。这是通过低秩稀疏的非负矩阵分解理论来适当地解决问题，其中低秩是通过使用复杂的罚函数来促进的。然后提出一个交替的近端算法来最小化新出现的成本函数。通过模拟和实际数据实验得到的结果验证了所提出方法的有效性。
