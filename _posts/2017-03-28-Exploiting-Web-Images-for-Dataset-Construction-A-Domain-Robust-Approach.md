##### Abstract
Labelled image datasets have played a critical role in high-level image understanding. However, the process of manual labelling is both time-consuming and labor intensive. To reduce the cost of manual labelling, there has been increased research interest in automatically constructing image datasets by exploiting web images. Datasets constructed by existing methods tend to have a weak domain adaptation ability, which is known as the "dataset bias problem". To address this issue, we present a novel image dataset construction framework that can be generalized well to unseen target domains. Specifically, the given queries are first expanded by searching the Google Books Ngrams Corpus to obtain a rich semantic description, from which the visually non-salient and less relevant expansions are filtered out. By treating each selected expansion as a "bag" and the retrieved images as "instances", image selection can be formulated as a multi-instance learning problem with constrained positive bags. We propose to solve the employed problems by the cutting-plane and concave-convex procedure (CCCP) algorithm. By using this approach, images from different distributions can be kept while noisy images are filtered out. To verify the effectiveness of our proposed approach, we build an image dataset with 20 categories. Extensive experiments on image classification, cross-dataset generalization, diversity comparison and object detection demonstrate the domain robustness of our dataset.

标记的图像数据集在高级图像理解中发挥了关键作用。但是，手工贴标的过程既费时又费力。为了降低手动标记的成本，利用网络图像自动构建图像数据集的研究兴趣增加。现有方法构建的数据集往往具有弱域适应能力，这就是所谓的“数据集偏差问题”。为了解决这个问题，我们提出了一个新的图像数据集的建设框架，可以推广到不可见的目标领域。具体来说，首先通过搜索Google Books Ngrams语料库来扩展给定的查询以获得丰富的语义描述，从中滤出视觉上不显着且较少相关​​的扩展。通过将每个选定的展开视为“包”并将检索到的图像视为“实例”，可将图像选择制定为带有约束的正面包的多实例学习问题。我们提出通过切割平面和凹凸程序（CCCP）算法来解决所使用的问题。通过使用这种方法，可以保留不同分布的图像，同时滤除噪声图像。为了验证我们提出的方法的有效性，我们建立了20个类别的图像数据集。在图像分类，交叉数据集泛化，多样性比较和目标检测方面的大量实验证明了我们的数据集的域鲁棒性。
