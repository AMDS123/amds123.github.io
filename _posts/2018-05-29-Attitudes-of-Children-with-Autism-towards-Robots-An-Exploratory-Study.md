##### Abstract
In this exploratory study we assessed how attitudes of children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) towards robots together with children's autism-related social impairments are linked to indicators of children's preference of an interaction with a robot over an interaction with a person. We found that children with ASD have overall positive attitudes towards robots and that they often prefer interacting with a robot than with a person. Several of children's attitudes were linked to children's longer gazes towards a robot compared to a person. Autism-related social impairments were linked to more repetitive and stereotyped behaviors and to a shorter gaze duration in the interaction with the robot compared to the person. These preliminary results contribute to better understand factors that might help determine sub-groups of children with ASD for whom robots could be particularly useful.

在这项探索性研究中，我们评估了患有自闭症谱系障碍（ASD）的儿童对机器人的态度以及儿童与自闭症有关的社会障碍与儿童与机器人在与人交往时互动的偏好指标。我们发现ASD儿童对机器人总体持肯定态度，他们通常更喜欢与机器人互动，而不喜欢与人交往。几个孩子的态度与孩子们长时间注视机器人而不是一个人相关。与自闭症相关的社交障碍与更多的重复和刻板行为相关联，并且与机器人相比与人相比与更短的注视持续时间有关。这些初步结果有助于更好地了解可能有助于确定机器人特别有用的ASD儿童亚群的因素。
