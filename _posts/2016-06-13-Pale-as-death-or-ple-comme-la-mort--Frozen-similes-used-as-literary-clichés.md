##### Abstract
The present study is focused on the automatic identification and description of frozen similes in British and French novels written between the 19 th century and the beginning of the 20 th century. Two main patterns of frozen similes were considered: adjectival ground + simile marker + nominal vehicle (e.g. happy as a lark) and eventuality + simile marker + nominal vehicle (e.g. sleep like a top). All potential similes and their components were first extracted using a rule-based algorithm. Then, frozen similes were identified based on reference lists of existing similes and semantic distance between the tenor and the vehicle. The results obtained tend to confirm the fact that frozen similes are not used haphazardly in literary texts. In addition, contrary to how they are often presented, frozen similes often go beyond the ground or the eventuality and the vehicle to also include the tenor.

本研究集中于19世纪至20世纪初英法小说中冷冻色彩的自动识别与描述。考虑了两种主要的冷冻比喻模式：吸气地面+明喻标志+标称车辆（例如快乐百灵）和可能性+明喻标志+标称车辆（例如像上面的睡觉）。首先使用基于规则的算法提取所有潜在的明喻及其组成部分。然后，根据现有的明喻和男高音与车辆之间的语义距离的参考清单来识别冷冻的明喻。所获得的结果倾向于证实，在文学文本中冷冻的明喻并不是随意使用的。另外，与他们经常出现的情况相反，冷冻的明喻经常超越地面或事件，车辆也包括男高音。
