##### Abstract
This paper will describe a novel approach to the cocktail party problem that relies on a fully convolutional neural network (FCN) architecture. The FCN takes noisy audio data as input and performs nonlinear, filtering operations to produce clean audio data of the target speech at the output. Our method learns a model for one specific speaker, and is then able to extract that speakers voice from babble background noise. 
 Results from experimentation indicate the ability to generalize to new speakers and robustness to new noise environments of varying signal-to-noise ratios. A potential application of this method would be for use in hearing aids. A pre-trained model could be quickly fine tuned for an individuals family members and close friends, and deployed onto a hearing aid to assist listeners in noisy environments.

本文将描述一种依赖于完全卷积神经网络（FCN）架构的鸡尾酒会问题的新方法。 FCN将噪声音频数据作为输入并执行非线性滤波操作以在输出处产生目标语音的干净音频数据。我们的方法为一个特定的说话者学习模型，然后能够从嘈杂的背景噪声中提取说话者的声音。
 实验结果表明，能够推广到新的扬声器，并对不同信噪比的新噪声环境具有鲁棒性。该方法的潜在应用将用于助听器。可以为个人家庭成员和亲密朋友快速调整预先训练的模型，并将其部署到助听器上以帮助嘈杂环境中的听众。
