##### Abstract
Semantic NLP applications often rely on dependency trees to recognize major elements of the proposition structure of sentences. Yet, while much semantic structure is indeed expressed by syntax, many phenomena are not easily read out of dependency trees, often leading to further ad-hoc heuristic post-processing or to information loss. To directly address the needs of semantic applications, we present PropS -- an output representation designed to explicitly and uniformly express much of the proposition structure which is implied from syntax, and an associated tool for extracting it from dependency trees.

语义NLP应用通常依赖于依赖树来识别命题结构的主要元素。然而，尽管许多语义结构确实由语法表达，但很多现象不容易从相关性树中读出，往往导致进一步的特设启发式后处理或信息丢失。为了直接解决语义应用的需求，我们提出了PropS  - 一种输出表示，它被设计为显式地和一致地表达许多从语法中隐含的命题结构，以及从依赖树中提取它的相关工具。
