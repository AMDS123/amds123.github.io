##### Abstract
We address the problem of landmark-based vehicle self-localization by relying on multi-modal sensory information. Our goal is to determine the autonomous vehicle's pose based on landmark measurements and map landmarks. The map is built by extracting landmarks from the vehicle's field of view in an off-line way, while the measurements are collected in the same way during inference. To map the measurements and map landmarks to the vehicle's pose, we propose DeepLocalization, a deep neural network that copes with dynamic input. Our network is robust to missing landmarks that occur due to the dynamic environment and handles unordered and adaptive input. In real-world experiments, we evaluate two inference approaches to show that DeepLocalization can be combined with GPS-sensors and is complementary to filtering approaches such as an extended Kalman filter. We show that our approach achieves state-of-the-art accuracy and is about ten times faster than the related work.
