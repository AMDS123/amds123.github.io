##### Abstract
The problem of accurately predicting relative reading difficulty across a set of sentences arises in a number of important natural language applications, such as finding and curating effective usage examples for intelligent language tutoring systems. Yet while significant research has explored document- and passage-level reading difficulty, the special challenges involved in assessing aspects of readability for single sentences have received much less attention, particularly when considering the role of surrounding passages. We introduce and evaluate a novel approach for estimating the relative reading difficulty of a set of sentences, with and without surrounding context. Using different sets of lexical and grammatical features, we explore models for predicting pairwise relative difficulty using logistic regression, and examine rankings generated by aggregating pairwise difficulty labels using a Bayesian rating system to form a final ranking. We also compare rankings derived for sentences assessed with and without context, and find that contextual features can help predict differences in relative difficulty judgments across these two conditions.

在一系列重要的自然语言应用中，出现了精确预测一组句子间相对阅读难度的问题，例如寻找和管理智能语言辅导系统的有效使用例子。然而，虽然重要的研究探索了文档和段落阅读难度，但是评估单句可读性方面的特殊挑战却受到的关注较少，特别是在考虑周围段落的作用时。我们介绍和评估一种新颖的方法来估计一组句子的相对阅读难度，有和没有周围的背景。通过使用不同的词汇和语法特征，我们探索使用逻辑回归预测成对相对困难的模型，并且通过使用贝叶斯评分系统聚合成对困难标签来检查排名，以形成最终排名。我们还比较了用上下文评估的句子得出的排名，并发现上下文特征可以帮助预测在这两个条件下相对困难判断的差异。
