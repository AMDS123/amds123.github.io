##### Abstract
Depth cameras are utilized in many applications. Recently light field approaches are increasingly being used for depth computation. While these approaches demonstrate the technical feasibility, they can not be brought into real-world application, since they have both a high computation time as well as a large design. Exactly these two drawbacks are overcome in this paper. For the first time, we present a depth camera based on the light field principle, which provides real-time depth information as well as a compact design.
