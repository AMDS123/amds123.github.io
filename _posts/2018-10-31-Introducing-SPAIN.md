##### Abstract
A novel sparsity-based algorithm for audio inpainting is proposed by translating the SPADE algorithm by Kiti\'c et. al.---the state-of-the-art for audio declipping---into the task of audio inpainting. SPAIN (SParse Audio INpainter) comes in synthesis and analysis variants. Experiments show that both A-SPAIN and S-SPAIN outperform other sparsity-based inpainting algorithms and that A-SPAIN performs on a par with the state-of-the-art method based on linear prediction.
