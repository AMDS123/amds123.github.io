##### Abstract
Among Zellig Harris's numerous contributions to linguistics his theory of the sublanguages of science probably ranks among the most underrated. However, not only has this theory led to some exhaustive and meaningful applications in the study of the grammar of immunology language and its changes over time, but it also illustrates the nature of mathematical relations between chunks or subsets of a grammar and the language as a whole. This becomes most clear when dealing with the connection between metalanguage and language, as well as when reflecting on operators. This paper tries to justify the claim that the sublanguages of science stand in a particular algebraic relation to the rest of the language they are embedded in, namely, that of right ideals in a ring.

在Zellig Harris对语言学的众多贡献中，他的科学子语言理论可能是最被低估的。然而，这个理论不仅在免疫学语言的语法及其随时间变化的研究中得到了一些详尽的，有意义的应用，而且也说明了语法的块或子集与语言的数学关系的性质整个。在处理元语言和语言之间的联系时，以及在对操作者进行反思时，这变得最清楚。本文试图证明科学的子语言与其所嵌入语言的其余部分具有特定的代数关系，即正确的理想在一个环中。
