##### Abstract
The Internet of Things (IoT) is an extension of the traditional Internet, which allows a very large number of smart devices, such as home appliances, network cameras, sensors and controllers to connect to one another to share information and improve user experiences. Current IoT devices are typically micro-computers for domain-specific computations rather than traditional functionspecific embedded devices. Therefore, many existing attacks, targeted at traditional computers connected to the Internet, may also be directed at IoT devices. For example, DDoS attacks have become very common in IoT environments, as these environments currently lack basic security monitoring and protection mechanisms, as shown by the recent Mirai and Brickerbot IoT botnets. In this paper, we propose a novel light-weight approach for detecting DDos malware in IoT environments.We firstly extract one-channel gray-scale images converted from binaries, and then utilize a lightweight convolutional neural network for classifying IoT malware families. The experimental results show that the proposed system can achieve 94.0% accuracy for the classification of goodware and DDoS malware, and 81.8% accuracy for the classification of goodware and two main malware families.

物联网（IoT）是传统互联网的延伸，它允许大量智能设备（例如家用电器，网络摄像机，传感器和控制器）彼此连接以共享信息并改善用户体验。目前的物联网设备通常是用于特定领域计算的微型计算机，而不是传统的功能特定的嵌入式设备。因此，针对连接到互联网的传统计算机的许多现有攻击也可能针对物联网设备。例如，DDoS攻击在物联网环境中已经非常普遍，因为这些环境目前缺乏基本的安全监控和保护机制，如最近的Mirai和Brickerbot物联网僵尸网络所示。在本文中，我们提出了一种新的轻量级方法来检测物联网环境中的DDos恶意软件。我们首先提取从二进制转换而来的单通道灰度图像，然后利用轻量级卷积神经网络对物联网恶意软件系列进行分类。实验结果表明，该系统对Goodware和DDoS恶意软件的分类准确率达到94.0％，对Goodware和两个主要恶意软件家族进行分类的准确率达到81.8％。
