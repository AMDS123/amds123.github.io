##### Abstract
We propose the construction of a prototype scanner designed to capture multispectral images of documents. A standard sheet-feed scanner is modified by disconnecting its internal light source and connecting an external multispectral light source comprising of narrow band light emitting diodes (LED). A document is scanned by illuminating the scanner light guide successively with different LEDs and capturing a scan of the document. The system is portable and can be used for potential applications in verification of questioned documents, cheques, receipts and bank notes.
