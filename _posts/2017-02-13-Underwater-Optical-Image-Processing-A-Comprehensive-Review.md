##### Abstract
Underwater cameras are widely used to observe the sea floor. They are usually included in autonomous underwater vehicles, unmanned underwater vehicles, and in situ ocean sensor networks. Despite being an important sensor for monitoring underwater scenes, there exist many issues with recent underwater camera sensors. Because of lights transportation characteristics in water and the biological activity at the sea floor, the acquired underwater images often suffer from scatters and large amounts of noise. Over the last five years, many methods have been proposed to overcome traditional underwater imaging problems. This paper aims to review the state-of-the-art techniques in underwater image processing by highlighting the contributions and challenges presented in over 40 papers. We present an overview of various underwater image processing approaches, such as underwater image descattering, underwater image color restoration, and underwater image quality assessments. Finally, we summarize the future trends and challenges in designing and processing underwater imaging sensors.

水下摄像机广泛用于观察海底。它们通常包括在自主水下车辆，无人水下车辆和原位海洋传感器网络中。尽管作为监测水下场景的重要传感器，但近来水下摄像机传感器存在许多问题。由于水中的灯光传输特性和海底的生物活动，所获得的水下图像经常会出现散射和大量的噪声。在过去的五年中，已经提出了许多方法来克服传统的水下成像问题。本文旨在通过强调40多篇论文中的贡献和挑战，来回顾水下图像处理中的最新技术。我们提供了各种水下图像处理方法的概述，如水下图像散射，水下图像颜色恢复和水下图像质量评估。最后，我们总结了设计和处理水下成像传感器的未来趋势和挑战。
