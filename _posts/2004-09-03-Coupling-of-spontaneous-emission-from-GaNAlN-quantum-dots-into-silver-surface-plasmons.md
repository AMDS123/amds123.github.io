##### Abstract
We have demonstrated surface-plasmon induced change in spontaneous emission rate in the ultraviolet regime at ~ 375-380 nm, using AlN/GaN quantum dots (QD). Using time-resolved and continuous-wave photoluminescence measurements, the recombination rate in AlN/GaN QD is shown to be enhanced when spontaneous emission is resonantly coupled to a metal-surface plasmon mode. The exciton recombination process via Ag-surface plasmon modes is observed to be as much as 3-7 times faster than in normal QD spontaneous emission and depends strongly on the emission wavelength and silver thickness.
