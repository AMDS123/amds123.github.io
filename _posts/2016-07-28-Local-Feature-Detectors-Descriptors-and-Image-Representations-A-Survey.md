##### Abstract
With the advances in both stable interest region detectors and robust and distinctive descriptors, local feature-based image or object retrieval has become a popular research topic. %All of the local feature-based image retrieval system involves two important processes: local feature extraction and image representation. The other key technology for image retrieval systems is image representation such as the bag-of-visual words (BoVW), Fisher vector, or Vector of Locally Aggregated Descriptors (VLAD) framework. In this paper, we review local features and image representations for image retrieval. Because many and many methods are proposed in this area, these methods are grouped into several classes and summarized. In addition, recent deep learning-based approaches for image retrieval are briefly reviewed.

随着稳定感兴趣区域检测器和鲁棒独特的描述符的发展，基于局部特征的图像或对象检索已经成为一个热门的研究课题。 ％所有基于局部特征的图像检索系统都涉及到两个重要的过程：局部特征提取和图像表示。图像检索系统的另一个关键技术是图像表示，如视觉词袋（BoVW），Fisher矢量或局部聚合描述符矢量（VLAD）框架。在本文中，我们审查图像检索的局部特征和图像表示。由于在这方面提出了许多方法，所以这些方法被分为几类并进行总结。另外，简要回顾了最近基于深度学习的图像检索方法。
