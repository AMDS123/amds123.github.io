##### Abstract
A negative result is when the outcome of an experiment or a model is not what is expected or when a hypothesis does not hold. Despite being often overlooked in the scientific community, negative results are results and they carry value. While this topic has been extensively discussed in other fields such as social sciences and biosciences, less attention has been paid to it in the computer vision community. The unique characteristics of computer vision, particularly its experimental aspect, call for a special treatment of this matter. In this paper, I will address what makes negative results important, how they should be disseminated and incentivized, and what lessons can be learned from cognitive vision research in this regard. Further, I will discuss issues such as computer vision and human vision interaction, experimental design and statistical hypothesis testing, explanatory versus predictive modeling, performance evaluation, model comparison, as well as computer vision research culture.

##### Abstract (translated by Google)
否定的结果是，实验或模型的结果不是预期的结果或假设不成立时。尽管在科学界经常被忽视，但是结果却是负面的结果，并且带有价值。虽然在社会科学和生物科学等其他领域已经广泛讨论了这个话题，但是在计算机视觉领域却没有给予足够的重视。计算机视觉的独特特性，特别是其实验方面，要求对这个问题进行特殊的处理。在这篇文章中，我将解释什么使得消极的结果变得重要，如何传播和激励，以及从这方面的认知视觉研究中可以学到什么。进一步讨论计算机视觉与人类视觉交互，实验设计与统计假设检验，解释与预测建模，性能评估，模型比较以及计算机视觉研究文化等问题。
