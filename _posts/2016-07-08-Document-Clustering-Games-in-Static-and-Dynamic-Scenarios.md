##### Abstract
In this work we propose a game theoretic model for document clustering. Each document to be clustered is represented as a player and each cluster as a strategy. The players receive a reward interacting with other players that they try to maximize choosing their best strategies. The geometry of the data is modeled with a weighted graph that encodes the pairwise similarity among documents, so that similar players are constrained to choose similar strategies, updating their strategy preferences at each iteration of the games. We used different approaches to find the prototypical elements of the clusters and with this information we divided the players into two disjoint sets, one collecting players with a definite strategy and the other one collecting players that try to learn from others the correct strategy to play. The latter set of players can be considered as new data points that have to be clustered according to previous information. This representation is useful in scenarios in which the data are streamed continuously. The evaluation of the system was conducted on 13 document datasets using different settings. It shows that the proposed method performs well compared to different document clustering algorithms.

在这项工作中，我们提出了一个文档聚类的博弈论模型。每个要聚集的文档都被表示为一个玩家，每个聚类都是一个策略。玩家获得与其他玩家互动的奖励，他们试图最大限度地选择最佳策略。数据的几何模型是用一个加权图形来编码的，这个加权图形编码了文件之间的成对相似性，所以类似的玩家被迫选择类似的策略，在游戏的每一次迭代中更新他们的策略偏好。我们使用不同的方法来找到这些集群的原型元素，并且根据这些信息，我们将玩家分成两个不相交的集合，一个是收集玩家一个明确的策略，另一个是收集玩家试图从别人那里学习正确的策略。后一组玩家可以被视为新的数据点，必须根据以前的信息进行聚类。这种表示在数据连续流传输的场景中很有用。使用不同的设置对13个文档数据集进行系统评估。结果表明，与不同的文档聚类算法相比，所提方法性能较好。
