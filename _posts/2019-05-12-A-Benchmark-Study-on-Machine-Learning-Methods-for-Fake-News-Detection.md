##### Abstract
The proliferation of fake news and its propagation on social media have become a major concern due to its ability to create devastating impacts. Different machine learning approaches have been attempted to detect it. However, most of those focused on a special type of news (such as political) and did not apply many advanced techniques. In this research, we conduct a benchmark study to assess the performance of different applicable approaches on three different datasets where the largest and most diversified one was developed by us. We also implemented some advanced deep learning models that have shown promising results.
