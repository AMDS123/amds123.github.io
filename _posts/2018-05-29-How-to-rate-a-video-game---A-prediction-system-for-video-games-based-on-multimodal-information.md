##### Abstract
Video games have become an integral part of most people's lives in recent times. This led to an abundance of data related to video games being shared online. However, this comes with issues such as incorrect ratings, reviews or anything that is being shared. Recommendation systems are powerful tools that help users by providing them with meaningful recommendations. A straightforward approach would be to predict the scores of video games based on other information related to the game. It could be used as a means to validate user-submitted ratings as well as provide recommendations. This work provides a method to predict the G-Score, that defines how good a video game is, from its trailer (video) and summary (text). We first propose models to predict the G-Score based on the trailer alone (unimodal). Later on, we show that considering information from multiple modalities helps the models perform better compared to using information from videos alone. Since we couldn't find any suitable multimodal video game dataset, we created our own dataset named VGD (Video Game Dataset) and provide it along with this work. The approach mentioned here can be generalized to other multimodal datasets such as movie trailers and summaries etc. Towards the end, we talk about the shortcomings of the work and some methods to overcome them.

##### Abstract (translated by Google)
电子游戏近来已成为大多数人生活中不可分割的一部分。这导致了大量与在线共享视频游戏相关的数据。但是，这带来了诸如不正确的评级，评论或任何正在共享的问题。推荐系统是强大的工具，通过向用户提供有意义的建议来帮助用户。直接的方法是根据与游戏相关的其他信息来预测视频游戏的分数。它可以用来验证用户提交的评分以及提供建议。这项工作提供了一种方法来预测G评分，即从其预告片（视频）和摘要（文本）中定义视频游戏的效果。我们首先提出基于预告片（单峰）来预测G-分数的模型。之后，我们表明，考虑来自多种模式的信息，与单独使用来自视频的信息相比，有助于模型更好地发挥作用。由于我们找不到任何合适的多模式视频游戏数据集，我们创建了自己的数据集名为VGD（视频游戏数据集），并将其与该工作一起提供。这里提到的方法可以推广到其他多模态数据集，例如电影预告片和摘要等。最后，我们讨论工作的缺点以及克服它们的一些方法。
