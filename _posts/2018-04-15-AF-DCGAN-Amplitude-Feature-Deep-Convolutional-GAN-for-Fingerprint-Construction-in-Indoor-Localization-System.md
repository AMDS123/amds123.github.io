##### Abstract
Wi-Fi positioning is currently the mainstream indoor positioning method, and the construction of fingerprint database is crucial to Wi-Fi based localization system. However, the accuracy requirement needs to sample enough data at many reference points, which consumes significant manpower and time. In this paper, we convert the CSI data collected at reference points into amplitude feature maps and then extend the fingerprint database using the proposed Amplitude Feature Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Network (AF-DCGAN) model. Using this model, the convergence process in the training phase can be accelerated, and the diversity of the CSI amplitude feature maps can be increased significantly. Based on the extended fingerprint database, the accuracy of indoor localization system can be improved with reduced human effort.
