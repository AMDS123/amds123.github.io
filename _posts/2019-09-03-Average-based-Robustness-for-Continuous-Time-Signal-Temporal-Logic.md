##### Abstract
We propose a new robustness score for continuous-time Signal Temporal Logic (STL) specifications. Instead of considering only the most severe point along the evolution of the signal, we use average scores to extract more information from the signal, emphasizing robust satisfaction of all the specifications' subformulae over their entire time interval domains. We demonstrate the advantages of this new score in falsification and control synthesis problems in systems with complex dynamics and multi-agent systems.
