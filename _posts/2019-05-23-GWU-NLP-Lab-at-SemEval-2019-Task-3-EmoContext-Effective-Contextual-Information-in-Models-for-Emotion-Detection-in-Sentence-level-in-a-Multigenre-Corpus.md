##### Abstract
In this paper we present an emotion classifier model submitted to the SemEval-2019 Task 3: EmoContext. The task objective is to classify emotion (i.e. happy, sad, angry) in a 3-turn conversational data set. We formulate the task as a classification problem and introduce a Gated Recurrent Neural Network (GRU) model with attention layer, which is bootstrapped with contextual information and trained with a multigenre corpus. We utilize different word embeddings to empirically select the most suited one to represent our features. We train the model with a multigenre emotion corpus to leverage using all available training sets to bootstrap the results. We achieved overall %56.05 f1-score and placed 144.
