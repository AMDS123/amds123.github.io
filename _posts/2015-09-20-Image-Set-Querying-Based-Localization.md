##### Abstract
Conventional single image based localization methods usually fail to localize a querying image when there exist large variations between the querying image and the pre-built scene. To address this, we propose an image-set querying based localization approach. When the localization by a single image fails to work, the system will ask the user to capture more auxiliary images. First, a local 3D model is established for the querying image set. Then, the pose of the querying image set is estimated by solving a nonlinear optimization problem, which aims to match the local 3D model against the pre-built scene. Experiments have shown the effectiveness and feasibility of the proposed approach.

传统的基于单幅图​​像的定位方法通常在查询图像与预建场景之间存在较大差异时，不能定位查询图像。为了解决这个问题，我们提出一个基于图像集查询的定位方法。当单个图像定位失败时，系统会要求用户捕捉更多的辅助图像。首先，为查询图像集建立局部3D模型。然后，通过求解一个非线性优化问题来估计查询图像集的姿态，该非线性优化问题旨在使局部3D模型与预先构建的场景相匹配。实验表明了所提出方法的有效性和可行性。
