##### Abstract
Visual place recognition is particularly challenging when places suffer changes in its appearance. Such changes are indeed common, e.g., due to weather, night/day or seasons. In this paper we leverage on recent research using deep networks, and explore how they can be improved by exploiting the temporal sequence information. Specifically, we propose 3 different alternatives (Descriptor Grouping, Fusion and Recurrent Descriptors) for deep networks to use several frames of a sequence. We show that our approaches produce more compact and best performing descriptors than single- and multi-view baselines in the literature in two public databases.
