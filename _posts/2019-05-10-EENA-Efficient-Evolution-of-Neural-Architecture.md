##### Abstract
Latest algorithms for automatic neural architecture search perform remarkable but basically directionless in search space and computational expensive in the training of every intermediate architecture. In this paper, we propose a method for efficient architecture search called EENA (Efficient Evolution of Neural Architecture) with mutation and crossover operations guided by the information have already been learned to speed up this process and consume less computational effort by reducing redundant searching and training. On CIFAR-10 classification, EENA using minimal computational resources (0.65 GPU-days) can design highly effective neural architecture which achieves 2.56% test error with 8.47M parameters. Furthermore, The best architecture discovered is also transferable for CIFAR-100.
