##### Abstract
As the population of world is increasing, and even more concentrated in urban areas, ensuring public safety is becoming a taunting job for security personnel and crowd managers. Mass events like sports, festivals, concerts, political gatherings attract thousand of people in a constraint environment,therefore adequate safety measures should be adopted. Despite safety measures, crowd disasters still occur frequently. Understanding underlying dynamics and behavior of crowd is becoming areas of interest for most of computer scientists. In recent years, researchers developed several models for understanding crowd dynamics. These models should be properly calibrated and validated by means of data acquired in the field. In this paper, we developed a computer vision tool set that can be helpful not only in initializing the crowd simulation models but can also validate the simulation results. The main features of proposed tool set are: (1) Crowd flow segmentation and crowd counting, (2) Identifying source/sink location for understanding crowd behavior, (3) Group detection and tracking in crowds.

随着世界人口的不断增加，城市更加集中，确保公共安全已成为保安人员和群众管理者的嘲弄工作。体育，节日，音乐会，政治集会等群众性事件在困难的环境下吸引了上千人，因此应采取适当的安全措施。尽管采取了安全措施，人群灾害仍然频繁发生。了解潜在的人群动态和行为正成为大多数计算机科学家感兴趣的领域。近年来，研究人员开发了多种理解人群动态的模型。这些模型应该通过现场采集的数据进行适当的校准和验证。在本文中，我们开发了一个计算机视觉工具集，不仅可以帮助初始化人群模拟模型，还可以验证模拟结果。提出的工具集的主要特点是：（1）人群流动分割和人群统计;（2）识别源/汇位置以便了解人群行为;（3）群体中的群体检测和跟踪。
