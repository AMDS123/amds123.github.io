##### Abstract
In the last years many accurate decision support systems have been constructed as black boxes, that is as systems that hide their internal logic to the user. This lack of explanation constitutes both a practical and an ethical issue. The literature reports many approaches aimed at overcoming this crucial weakness sometimes at the cost of scarifying accuracy for interpretability. The applications in which black box decision systems can be used are various, and each approach is typically developed to provide a solution for a specific problem and, as a consequence, delineating explicitly or implicitly its own definition of interpretability and explanation. The aim of this paper is to provide a classification of the main problems addressed in the literature with respect to the notion of explanation and the type of black box system. Given a problem definition, a black box type, and a desired explanation this survey should help the researcher to find the proposals more useful for his own work. The proposed classification of approaches to open black box models should also be useful for putting the many research open questions in perspective.

##### Abstract (translated by Google)
在过去的几年中，许多精确的决策支持系统已经被构建为黑匣子，就像系统向用户隐藏其内部逻辑。缺乏解释既是一个实际问题，也是一个道德问题。文献报道了许多旨在克服这种重要弱点的方法，有时以牺牲解释性的准确性为代价。可以使用黑匣子决策系统的应用是多种多样的，每种方法通常被开发来为特定问题提供解决方案，并因此明确或隐含地描述自己对可解释性和解释的定义。本文的目的是对文献中关于解释概念和黑匣子类型的主要问题进行分类。给定一个问题的定义，一个黑盒子的类型，这个调查的理想解释应该有助于研究人员找到对自己的工作更有用的建议。提出的开放黑盒模型方法的分类也应该有助于将许多研究的开放性问题展望出来。
