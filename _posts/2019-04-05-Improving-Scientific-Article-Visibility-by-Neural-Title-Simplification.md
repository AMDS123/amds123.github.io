##### Abstract
The rapidly growing amount of data that scientific content providers should deliver to a user makes them create effective recommendation tools. A title of an article is often the only shown element to attract people's attention. We offer an approach to automatic generating titles with various levels of informativeness to benefit from different categories of users. Statistics from ResearchGate used to bias train datasets and specially designed post-processing step applied to neural sequence-to-sequence models allow reaching the desired variety of simplified titles to gain a trade-off between the attractiveness and transparency of recommendation.
