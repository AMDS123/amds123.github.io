##### Abstract
Icosoku is a challenging and interesting puzzle that exhibits highly symmetrical and combinatorial nature. In this paper, we pose the questions derived from the puzzle, but with more difficulty and generality. In addition, we also present a constraint programming model for the proposed questions, which can provide the answers to our first two questions. The purpose of this paper is to share our preliminary result and problems to encourage researchers in both group theory and constraint communities to consider this topic further.
