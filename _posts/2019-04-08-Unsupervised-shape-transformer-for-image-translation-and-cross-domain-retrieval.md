##### Abstract
We address the problem of unsupervised geometric image-to-image translation. Rather than transferring the style of an image as a whole, our goal is to translate the geometry of an object as depicted in different domains while preserving its appearance characteristics. Our model is trained in an unsupervised fashion, i.e. without the need of paired images during training. It performs all steps of the shape transfer within a single model and without additional post-processing stages. Extensive experiments on the VITON, CMU-Multi-PIE and our own FashionStyle datasets show the effectiveness of the method. In addition, we show that despite their low-dimensionality, the features learned by our model are useful to the item retrieval task.
