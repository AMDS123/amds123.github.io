##### Abstract
Text style transfer seeks to learn how to automatically rewrite sentences from a source domain to the target domain in different styles, while simultaneously preserving their semantic contents. A major challenge in this task stems from the lack of parallel data that connects the source and target styles. Existing approaches try to disentangle content and style, but this is quite difficult and often results in poor content-preservation and grammaticality. In contrast, we propose a novel approach by first constructing a pseudo-parallel resource that aligns a subset of sentences with similar content between source and target corpus. And then a standard sequence-to-sequence model can be applied to learn the style transfer. Subsequently, we iteratively refine the learned style transfer function while improving upon the imperfections in our original alignment. Our method is applied to the tasks of sentiment modification and formality transfer, where it outperforms state-of-the-art systems by a large margin. As an auxiliary contribution, we produced a publicly-available test set with human-generated style transfers for future community use.
