##### Abstract
High assurance surgical robotic systems require robustness to both safety issues and security issues (i.e adversarial interference). In this work, we argue that safety and security are not disjoint properties, but that security is a safety requirement. Surgical robotics presents new information flow requirements that includes multiple levels of confidentiality and integrity, as well as the need for compartmentation arising from conflicts of interest. We develop an information flow model that derives from lattice-based access control. This model addresses the flow constraints of the calibration lifecycle of surgical robots - an important aspect of a high-assurance environment.
