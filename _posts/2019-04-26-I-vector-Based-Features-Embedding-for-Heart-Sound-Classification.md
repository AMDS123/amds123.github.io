##### Abstract
Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is considered as one of the main causes of death in the world. Accordingly, scientists look for methods to recognize normal/abnormal heart patterns. Over recent years, researchers have been interested in to investigate CVDs based on heart sounds. The physionet 2016 corpus is presented to provide a standard database for researchers in this field. In this study we proposed an approach for normal/abnormal heart sound detection, based on i-vector features on phiysionet 2016 corpus. In this method, a fixed length vector, namely i-vector, is extracted from each record, and then Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is applied. Then Variational AuotoEncoders (VAE) is used to reduce dimensions of the obtained i-vector. After that, this i-vector and its transmitted version by PCA and VAE are used for training two Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs). Finally, test set is scored using these trained GMMs. In the next step we applied a simple global threshold to classify the obtained scores. We reported the results based on Equal Error Rate (EER) and Modified Accuracy (MAcc). Experimental results show the obtained Accuracy by our proposed system could improve the results reported on the baseline system by 16%.
