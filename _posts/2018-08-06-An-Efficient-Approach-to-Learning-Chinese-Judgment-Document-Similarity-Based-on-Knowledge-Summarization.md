##### Abstract
A previous similar case in common law systems can be used as a reference with respect to the current case such that identical situations can be treated similarly in every case. However, current approaches for judgment document similarity computation failed to capture the core semantics of judgment documents and therefore suffer from lower accuracy and higher computation complexity. In this paper, a knowledge block summarization based machine learning approach is proposed to compute the semantic similarity of Chinese judgment documents. By utilizing domain ontologies for judgment documents, the core semantics of Chinese judgment documents is summarized based on knowledge blocks. Then the WMD algorithm is used to calculate the similarity between knowledge blocks. At last, the related experiments were made to illustrate that our approach is very effective and efficient in achieving higher accuracy and faster computation speed in comparison with the traditional approaches.

普通法系统中的先前类似情况可以用作关于当前情况的参考，使得在每种情况下可以类似地处理相同的情况。然而，当前用于判断文档相似度计算的方法未能捕获判断文档的核心语义，因此具有较低的准确性和较高的计算复杂度。本文提出了一种基于知识块总结的机器学习方法来计算中文判断文档的语义相似度。通过利用领域本体判断文档，基于知识块总结了中文判断文档的核心语义。然后使用WMD算法计算知识块之间的相似性。最后，通过相关实验说明，与传统方法相比，我们的方法在实现更高精度和更快计算速度方面非常有效和高效。
