##### Abstract
The use of physical and behavioral characteristics for human identification is known as biometrics. Among the many biometrics traits available, the fingerprint is the most widely used. The fingerprint identification is based on the impression patterns, as the pattern of ridges and minutiae, characteristics of first and second levels respectively. The current identification systems use these two levels of fingerprint features due to the low cost of the sensors. However, due the recent advances in sensor technology, it is possible to use third level features present within the ridges, such as the perspiration pores. Recent studies have shown that the use of third-level features can increase security and fraud protection in biometric systems, since they are difficult to reproduce. In addition, recent researches have also focused on multibiometrics recognition due to its many advantages. The goal of this work was to apply fusion techniques for fingerprint recognition in order to combine minutiae, ridges and pore-based methods and, thus, provide more robust biometrics recognition systems. We evaluated isotropic-based and adaptive-based automatic pore extraction methods and the fusion of pore-based method with the identification methods based on minutiae and ridges. The experiments were performed on the public database PolyU HRF and showed a reduction of approximately 16% in the Equal Error Rate compared to the best results obtained by the methods individually.

物理和行为特征用于人类身份识别被称为生物识别。在许多可用的生物测量学特征中，指纹是使用最广泛的。指纹识别基于印象图案，分别为第一级和第二级的特征的脊和细节的图案。由于传感器成本低，目前的识别系统使用这两个级别的指纹特征。但是，由于近来传感器技术的进步，可以使用脊内存在的第三级特征，例如汗孔。最近的研究表明，使用第三级功能可以提高生物识别系统的安全性和欺诈保护，因为它们很难再现。另外，由于其多种优点，最近的研究也集中在多生物识别。这项工作的目标是将融合技术应用于指纹识别，以便将细节，脊和孔基方法结合起来，从而提供更强大的生物识别系统。我们评估了基于各向同性和基于自适应的自动孔隙提取方法以及基于孔隙的方法与基于细节和脊线的识别方法的融合。实验在公共数据库PolyU HRF上进行，与单独使用这些方法获得的最佳结果相比，在等误差率中减少了大约16％。
