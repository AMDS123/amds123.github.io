##### Abstract
Time-frequency methods for vibration-based gearbox faults detection have been considered the most efficient method. Among these methods, continuous wavelet transform (CWT) as one of the best time-frequency method has been used for both stationary and transitory signals. Some deficiencies of CWT are problem of overlapping and distortion ofsignals. In this condition, a large amount of redundant information exists so that it may cause false alarm or misinterpretation of the operator. In this paper a modified method called Exact Wavelet Analysis is used to minimize the effects of overlapping and distortion in case of gearbox faults. To implement exact wavelet analysis, Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm has been used for this purpose. This method have been implemented for the acceleration signals from 2D acceleration sensor acquired by Advantech PCI-1710 card from a gearbox test setup in Amirkabir University of Technology. Gearbox has been considered in both healthy and chipped tooth gears conditions. Kernelized Support Vector Machine (SVM) with radial basis functions has used the extracted features from exact wavelet analysis for classification. The efficiency of this classifier is then evaluated with the other signals acquired from the setup test. The results show that in comparison of CWT, PSO Exact Wavelet Transform has better ability in feature extraction in price of more computational effort. In addition, PSO exact wavelet has better speed comparing to Genetic Algorithm (GA) exact wavelet in condition of equal population because of factoring mutation and crossover in PSO algorithm. SVM classifier with the extracted features in gearbox shows very good results and its ability has been proved.

基于振动的变速箱故障检测的时频方法被认为是最有效的方法。在这些方法中，作为最佳时频方法之一的连续小波变换（CWT）已被用于静止信号和暂态信号两者。 CWT的一些缺陷是信号重叠和失真的问题。在这种情况下，存在大量的冗余信息，可能导致操作人员误报或误解。在本文中，一种称为精确小波分析的改进方法被用于在齿轮箱故障情况下将重叠和失真的影响最小化。为了实现精确的小波分析，粒子群优化（PSO）算法已经被用于此目的。在Amirkabir技术大学的齿轮箱测试装置中，研华PCI-1710卡采集的2D加速度传感器的加速信号已经实现了该方法。齿轮箱已被考虑在健康和切齿齿轮的条件。具有径向基函数的核化支持向量机（SVM）利用精确小波分析提取的特征进行分类。然后使用从设置测试中获取的其他信号评估该分类器的效率。结果表明，与CWT相比，PSO精确小波变换具有更好的特征提取能力，且计算量更大。另外，由于PSO算法中的因子变异和交叉，PSO精确小波在相同种群条件下比遗传算法（GA）精确小波具有更好的速度。 SVM分类器在齿轮箱中提取的特征显示出非常好的效果，并且其能力已被证明。
