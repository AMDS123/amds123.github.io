##### Abstract
A fully convolutional neural network has a receptive field of limited size and therefore cannot exploit global information, such as topological information. A solution is proposed in this paper to solve this problem, based on pre-processing with a geodesic operator. It is applied to the segmentation of histological images of pigmented reconstructed epidermis acquired via Whole Slide Imaging.
