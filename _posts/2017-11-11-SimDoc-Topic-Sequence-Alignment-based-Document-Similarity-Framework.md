##### Abstract
Document similarity is the problem of estimating the degree to which a given pair of documents has similar semantic content. An accurate document similarity measure can improve several enterprise relevant tasks such as document clustering, text mining, and question-answering. In this paper, we show that a document's thematic flow, which is often disregarded by bag-of-word techniques, is pivotal in estimating their similarity. To this end, we propose a novel semantic document similarity framework, called SimDoc. We model documents as topic-sequences, where topics represent latent generative clusters of related words. Then, we use a sequence alignment algorithm to estimate their semantic similarity. We further conceptualize a novel mechanism to compute topic-topic similarity to fine tune our system. In our experiments, we show that SimDoc outperforms many contemporary bag-of-words techniques in accurately computing document similarity, and on practical applications such as document clustering.

文档相似性是估计给定的一对文档具有相似语义内容的程度的问题。准确的文档相似性度量可以改进文档聚类，文本挖掘和问答等几个企业相关的任务。在本文中，我们表明，一个文件的主题流，这是经常无视袋字的技术，是估计其相似性的关键。为此，我们提出了一个新的语义文档相似性框架，称为SimDoc。我们将文档建模为主题序列，其中主题表示相关词的潜在生成聚类。然后，我们使用序列比对算法来估计它们的语义相似性。我们进一步概念化一个新的机制来计算话题话题相似度来微调我们的系统。在我们的实验中，我们展示了SimDoc在准确计算文档相似性和实际应用（如文档聚类）方面胜过了许多当代的词袋技术。
