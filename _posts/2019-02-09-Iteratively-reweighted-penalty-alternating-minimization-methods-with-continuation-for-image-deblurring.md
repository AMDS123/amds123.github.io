##### Abstract
In this paper, we consider a class of nonconvex problems with linear constraints appearing frequently in the area of image processing. We solve this problem by the penalty method and propose the iteratively reweighted alternating minimization algorithm. To speed up the algorithm, we also apply the continuation strategy to the penalty parameter. A convergence result is proved for the algorithm. Compared with the nonconvex ADMM, the proposed algorithm enjoys both theoretical and computational advantages like weaker convergence requirements and faster speed. Numerical results demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed algorithm.
