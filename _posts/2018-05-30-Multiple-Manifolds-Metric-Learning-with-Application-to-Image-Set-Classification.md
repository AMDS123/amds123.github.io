##### Abstract
In image set classification, a considerable advance has been made by modeling the original image sets by second order statistics or linear subspace, which typically lie on the Riemannian manifold. Specifically, they are Symmetric Positive Definite (SPD) manifold and Grassmann manifold respectively, and some algorithms have been developed on them for classification tasks. Motivated by the inability of existing methods to extract discriminatory features for data on Riemannian manifolds, we propose a novel algorithm which combines multiple manifolds as the features of the original image sets. In order to fuse these manifolds, the well-studied Riemannian kernels have been utilized to map the original Riemannian spaces into high dimensional Hilbert spaces. A metric Learning method has been devised to embed these kernel spaces into a lower dimensional common subspace for classification. The state-of-the-art results achieved on three datasets corresponding to two different classification tasks, namely face recognition and object categorization, demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

在图像集分类中，通过二阶统计或线性子空间（通常位于黎曼流形上）对原始图像集进行建模，已经取得了相当大的进步。具体来说，它们分别是对称正定（SPD）流形和Grassmann流形，并且已经为它们开发了一些用于分类任务的算法。由于现有方法无法为黎曼流形上的数据提取歧视性特征，因此我们提出了一种将多个流形组合为原始图像集的特征的新算法。为了融合这些流形，已经使用经过充分研究的黎曼核将原始黎曼空间映射到高维希尔伯特空间。一种度量学习方法已经被设计为将这些核空间嵌入到低维公共子空间中用于分类。在对应于两个不同分类任务（即人脸识别和对象分类）的三个数据集上实现的最新成果证明了所提出的方法的有效性。
