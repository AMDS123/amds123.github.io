##### Abstract
Cardiovascular monitoring is important to prevent diseases from progressing. The jugular venous pulse (JVP) waveform offers important clinical information about cardiac health, but is not routinely examined due to its invasive catheterisation procedure. Here, we demonstrate for the first time that the JVP can be consistently observed in a non-contact manner using a novel light-based photoplethysmographic imaging system, coded hemodynamic imaging (CHI). While traditional monitoring methods measure the JVP at a single location, CHI's wide-field imaging capabilities were able to observe the jugular venous pulse's spatial flow profile for the first time. The important inflection points in the JVP were observed, meaning that cardiac abnormalities can be assessed through JVP distortions. CHI provides a new way to assess cardiac health through non-contact light-based JVP monitoring, and can be used in non-surgical environments for cardiac assessment.

心血管监测对防止疾病进展很重要。颈静脉搏动（JVP）波形提供了有关心脏健康的重要临床信息，但由于其侵入性导管插入术程序而未被常规检查。在这里，我们首次证明，JVP可以始终以非接触的方式使用新型的基于光的光电容积脉搏波成像系统，编码血流动力学成像（CHI）进行观察。虽然传统的监测方法在单个位置测量JVP，但CHI的宽视场成像能力首次能够观察到颈静脉脉冲的空间流动剖面。观察到JVP中的重要拐点，意味着可以通过JVP扭曲评估心脏异常。 CHI为通过非接触式光源JVP监测提供了一种评估心脏健康的新方法，并且可以在非手术环境中用于心脏评估。
