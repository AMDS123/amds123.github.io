##### Abstract
In Actor and Observer we introduced a dataset linking the first and third-person video understanding domains, the Charades-Ego Dataset. In this paper we describe the egocentric aspect of the dataset and present annotations for Charades-Ego with 68,536 activity instances in 68.8 hours of first and third-person video, making it one of the largest and most diverse egocentric datasets available. Charades-Ego furthermore shares activity classes, scripts, and methodology with the Charades dataset, that consist of additional 82.3 hours of third-person video with 66,500 activity instances. Charades-Ego has temporal annotations and textual descriptions, making it suitable for egocentric video classification, localization, captioning, and new tasks utilizing the cross-modal nature of the data.
