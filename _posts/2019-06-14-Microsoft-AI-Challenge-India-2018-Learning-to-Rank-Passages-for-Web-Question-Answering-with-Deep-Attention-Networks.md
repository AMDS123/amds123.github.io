##### Abstract
This paper describes our system for The Microsoft AI Challenge India 2018: Ranking Passages for Web Question Answering. The system uses the biLSTM network with co-attention mechanism between query and passage representations. Additionally, we use self attention on embeddings to increase the lexical coverage by allowing the system to take union over different embeddings. We also incorporate hand-crafted features to improve the system performance. Our system achieved a Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR) of 0.67 on eval-1 dataset.
