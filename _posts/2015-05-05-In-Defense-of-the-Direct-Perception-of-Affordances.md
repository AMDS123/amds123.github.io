##### Abstract
The field of functional recognition or affordance estimation from images has seen a revival in recent years. As originally proposed by Gibson, the affordances of a scene were directly perceived from the ambient light: in other words, functional properties like sittable were estimated directly from incoming pixels. Recent work, however, has taken a mediated approach in which affordances are derived by first estimating semantics or geometry and then reasoning about the affordances. In a tribute to Gibson, this paper explores his theory of affordances as originally proposed. We propose two approaches for direct perception of affordances and show that they obtain good results and can out-perform mediated approaches. We hope this paper can rekindle discussion around direct perception and its implications in the long term.

近年来，图像中的功能识别或可供性估计领域已经复苏。正如Gibson最初提出的那样，场景的可供性是直接从环境光线中感知的：换句话说，功能性属性如坐标是直接从入射像素估计的。然而，最近的工作已经采取了一种中介方法，其中通过首先估计语义或几何，然后推导关于可供性的方法来推导可供性。为了向吉布森致敬，本文探讨了他最初提出的可供性的理论。我们提出了两种直观的可供性方法，并表明他们获得了良好的结果，并可以超越中介方法。我们希望这篇论文可以重新围绕直接看法及其影响进行长期的讨论。
