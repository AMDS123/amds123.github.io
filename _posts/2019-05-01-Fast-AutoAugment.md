##### Abstract
Data augmentation is an indispensable technique to improve generalization and also to deal with imbalanced datasets. Recently, AutoAugment has been proposed to automatically search augmentation policies from a dataset and has significantly improved performances on many image recognition tasks. However, its search method requires thousands of GPU hours to train even in a reduced setting. In this paper, we propose Fast AutoAugment algorithm that learns augmentation policies using a more efficient search strategy based on density matching. In comparison to AutoAugment, the proposed algorithm speeds up the search time by orders of magnitude while maintaining the comparable performances on the image recognition tasks with various models and datasets including CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet.
