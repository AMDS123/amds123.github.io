##### Abstract
Matching 3D rigid point clouds in complex environments robustly and accurately is still a core technique used in many applications. This paper proposes a new architecture combining error estimation from sample covariances and dual global probability alignment based on the convolution of adaptive Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM) from point clouds. Firstly, a novel adaptive GMM is defined using probability distributions from the corresponding points. Then rigid point cloud alignment is performed by maximizing the global probability from the convolution of dual adaptive GMMs in the whole 2D or 3D space, which can be efficiently optimized and has a large zone of accurate convergence. Thousands of trials have been conducted on 200 models from public 2D and 3D datasets to demonstrate superior robustness and accuracy in complex environments with unpredictable noise, outliers, occlusion, initial rotation, shape and missing points.

在复杂的环境中精确匹配3D刚性点云仍然是许多应用的核心技术。本文提出了一种基于点云自适应高斯混合模型（GMM）的卷积，结合样本协方差误差估计和双全局概率对齐的新体系结构。首先，利用相应点的概率分布定义一种新的自适应GMM。然后在整个二维或三维空间中，利用双自适应GMM的卷积来最大化全局概率，进行刚性点云对齐，可以进行高效优化，并具有较大的精确收敛区域。已经对来自公共2D和3D数据集的200个模型进行了数千次试验，以证明在具有不可预测噪声，异常值，遮挡，初始旋转，形状和缺失点的复杂环境中具有出色的稳健性和准确性。
