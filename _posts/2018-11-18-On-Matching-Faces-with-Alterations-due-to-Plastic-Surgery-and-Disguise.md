##### Abstract
Plastic surgery and disguise variations are two of the most challenging co-variates of face recognition. The state-of-art deep learning models are not sufficiently successful due to the availability of limited training samples. In this paper, a novel framework is proposed which transfers fundamental visual features learnt from a generic image dataset to supplement a supervised face recognition model. The proposed algorithm combines off-the-shelf supervised classifier and a generic, task independent network which encodes information related to basic visual cues such as color, shape, and texture. Experiments are performed on IIITD plastic surgery face dataset and Disguised Faces in the Wild (DFW) dataset. Results showcase that the proposed algorithm achieves state of the art results on both the datasets. Specifically on the DFW database, the proposed algorithm yields over 87% verification accuracy at 1% false accept rate which is 53.8% better than baseline results computed using VGGFace.
