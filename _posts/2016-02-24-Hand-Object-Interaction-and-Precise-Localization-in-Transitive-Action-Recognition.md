##### Abstract
Action recognition in still images has seen major improvement in recent years due to advances in human pose estimation, object recognition and stronger feature representations produced by deep neural networks. However, there are still many cases in which performance remains far from that of humans. A major difficulty arises in distinguishing between transitive actions in which the overall actor pose is similar, and recognition therefore depends on details of the grasp and the object, which may be largely occluded. In this paper we demonstrate how recognition is improved by obtaining precise localization of the action-object and consequently extracting details of the object shape together with the actor-object interaction. To obtain exact localization of the action object and its interaction with the actor, we employ a coarse-to-fine approach which combines semantic segmentation and contextual features, in successive stages. We focus on (but are not limited) to face-related actions, a set of actions that includes several currently challenging categories. We present an average relative improvement of 35% over state-of-the art and validate through experimentation the effectiveness of our approach.

##### Abstract (translated by Google)
静止图像中的动作识别由于人体姿态估计，物体识别和由深度神经网络产生的较强特征表示而得到进步，近年来取得了重大进展。然而，仍然有很多情况下，表现远远不如人类。区分整体行动者姿态相似的传递动作是一个很大的困难，因此识别依赖于把握和对象的细节，而这些细节可能在很大程度上被遮蔽了。在本文中，我们将演示如何通过获取动作对象的精确定位来提高识别效果，从而提取对象形状的细节以及动作者 - 对象的相互作用。为了获得动作对象的精确定位及其与动作者的相互作用，我们采用从粗到细的方法，将语义分割和上下文特征组合在一起。我们专注于（但不限于）与脸部相关的行为，这是一系列包含当前具有挑战性的类别的行动。我们对现有技术进行了35％的平均相对改进，并通过实验验证了我们方法的有效性。
