##### Abstract
We propose an approach to Multitask Learning (MTL) to make deep learning models faster and lighter for applications in which multiple tasks need to be solved simultaneously, which is particularly useful in embedded, real-time systems. We develop a multitask model for both Object Detection and Semantic Segmentation and analyze the challenges that appear during its training. Our multitask network is 1.6x faster, lighter and uses less memory than deploying the single-task models in parallel. We conclude that MTL has the potential to give superior performance in exchange of a more complex training process that introduces challenges not present in single-task models.

##### Abstract (translated by Google)
我们提出了一种多任务学习（MTL）的方法，使得对于需要同时解决多个任务的应用来说，更快，更轻的深度学习模型对于嵌入式实时系统特别有用。我们为对象检测和语义分割开发了一个多任务模型，并分析了培训过程中出现的挑战。我们的多任务网络比并行部署单任务模型快1.6倍，更轻，占用内存更少。我们得出结论：MTL有可能在更复杂的培训过程中提供卓越的绩效，这种培训过程引入了单任务模型中不存在的挑战。
