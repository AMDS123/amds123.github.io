##### Abstract
Compositionality in language refers to how much the meaning of some phrase can be decomposed into the meaning of its constituents and the way these constituents are combined. Based on the premise that substitution by synonyms is meaning-preserving, compositionality can be approximated as the semantic similarity between a phrase and a version of that phrase where words have been replaced by their synonyms. Different ways of representing such phrases exist (e.g., vectors [1] or language models [2]), and the choice of representation affects the measurement of semantic similarity. We propose a new compositionality detection method that represents phrases as ranked lists of term weights. Our method approximates the semantic similarity between two ranked list representations using a range of well-known distance and correlation metrics. In contrast to most state-of-the-art approaches in compositionality detection, our method is completely unsupervised. Experiments with a publicly available dataset of 1048 human-annotated phrases shows that, compared to strong supervised baselines, our approach provides superior measurement of compositionality using any of the distance and correlation metrics considered.

语言中的组合性是指一些词组的意义可以分解成多个组成部分的意义和这些组成部分的组合方式。基于同义词替换是保留意义的前提，组合性可以近似为短语与该短语的版本之间的语义相似性，其中单词被其同义词替换。存在表示这样的短语的不同方式（例如矢量[1]或语言模型[2]），表示的选择影响语义相似性的度量。我们提出了一种新的组合性检测方法，将短语表示为词权重的排序列表。我们的方法使用一系列众所周知的距离和相关度量来逼近两个排序列表表示之间的语义相似度。与大多数最先进的组合检测方法相比，我们的方法是完全无监督的。使用公开可用的1048个注释短语的数据集进行的实验表明，与强有力的监督基线相比，我们的方法使用所考虑的任何距离和相关度量提供了优越的组合性度量。
