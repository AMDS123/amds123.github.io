##### Abstract
This paper presents a novel appearance and shape feature, RISAS, which is robust to viewpoint, illumination, scale and rotation variations. RISAS consists of a keypoint detector and a feature descriptor both of which utilise texture and geometric information present in the appearance and shape channels. A novel response function based on the surface normals is used in combination with the Harris corner detector for selecting keypoints in the scene. A strategy that uses the depth information for scale estimation and background elimination is proposed to select the neighbourhood around the keypoints in order to build precise invariant descriptors. Proposed descriptor relies on the ordering of both grayscale intensity and shape information in the neighbourhood. Comprehensive experiments which confirm the effectiveness of the proposed RGB-D feature when compared with CSHOT and LOIND are presented. Furthermore, we highlight the utility of incorporating texture and shape information in the design of both the detector and the descriptor by demonstrating the enhanced performance of CSHOT and LOIND when combined with RISAS detector.

本文提出了一种新颖的外观和形状特征，RISAS，对视点，光照，比例和旋转变化具有鲁棒性。 RISAS由一个关键点检测器和一个特征描述符组成，两者都利用外观和形状通道中存在的纹理和几何信息。基于表面法线的新颖的响应函数与Harris角点检测器结合用于选择场景中的关键点。为了构建精确的不变描述符，提出了一种利用深度信息进行尺度估计和背景消除的策略，选择关键点周围的邻域。提出的描述符依赖于邻域中的灰度强度和形状信息的排序。介绍了与CSHOT和LOIND相比，提出的RGB-D特征有效性的综合实验。此外，我们强调将纹理和形状信息结合在探测器和描述符的设计中，通过与RISAS探测器结合证明CSHOT和LOIND的增强性能的效用。
