##### Abstract
Access to low cost retinal imaging devices in low and middle income countries is limited, compromising progress in preventing needless blindness. The Arclight is a recently developed low-cost solar powered direct ophthalmoscope which can be attached to the camera of a smartphone to acquire retinal images and video. However, the acquired data is inherently limited by the optics of direct ophthalmoscopy, resulting in a narrow field of view with associated corneal reflections, limiting its usefulness. In this work we describe the first fully automatic method utilizing videos acquired using the Arclight attached to a mobile phone camera to create wider view, higher quality still images comparable with images obtained using much more expensive and bulky dedicated traditional retinal cameras.

在中低收入国家获得低成本的视网膜成像设备是有限的，在防止不必要的失明方面取得进展。 Arclight是最近开发的低成本太阳能直接检眼镜，可以连接到智能手机的相机上获取视网膜图像和视频。然而，所获得的数据本质上受到直接检眼镜的光学限制，导致狭窄的视野以及相关联的角膜反射，限制了其有用性。在这个工作中，我们描述了第一个全自动的方法，利用Arclight附加到手机摄像头获得的视频来创造更广阔的视野，更高质量的静止图像与使用更昂贵和庞大的专用传统视网膜相机获得的图像相媲美。
