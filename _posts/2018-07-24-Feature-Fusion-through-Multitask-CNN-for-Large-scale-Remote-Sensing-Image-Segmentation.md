##### Abstract
In recent years, Fully Convolutional Networks (FCN) has been widely used in various semantic segmentation tasks, including multi-modal remote sensing imagery. How to fuse multi-modal data to improve the segmentation performance has always been a research hotspot. In this paper, a novel end-toend fully convolutional neural network is proposed for semantic segmentation of natural color, infrared imagery and Digital Surface Models (DSM). It is based on a modified DeepUNet and perform the segmentation in a multi-task way. The channels are clustered into groups and processed on different task pipelines. After a series of segmentation and fusion, their shared features and private features are successfully merged together. Experiment results show that the feature fusion network is efficient. And our approach achieves good performance in ISPRS Semantic Labeling Contest (2D).

近年来，完全卷积网络（FCN）已广泛用于各种语义分割任务，包括多模态遥感图像。如何融合多模态数据以提高分割性能一直是研究的热点。本文提出了一种新的端到端完全卷积神经网络，用于自然色，红外图像和数字表面模型（DSM）的语义分割。它基于修改后的DeepUNet，并以多任务方式执行分段。通道聚类成组并在不同的任务管道上处理。经过一系列细分和融合后，他们的共享功能和私有功能成功合并在一起。实验结果表明，特征融合网络是有效的。我们的方法在ISPRS语义标签竞赛（2D）中取得了良好的表现。
