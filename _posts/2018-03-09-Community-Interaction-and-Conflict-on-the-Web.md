##### Abstract
Users organize themselves into communities on web platforms. These communities can interact with one another, often leading to conflicts and toxic interactions. However, little is known about the mechanisms of interactions between communities and how they impact users. Here we study intercommunity interactions across 36,000 communities on Reddit, examining cases where users of one community are mobilized by negative sentiment to comment in another community. We show that such conflicts tend to be initiated by a handful of communities---less than 1% of communities start 74% of conflicts. While conflicts tend to be initiated by highly active community members, they are carried out by significantly less active members. We find that conflicts are marked by formation of echo chambers, where users primarily talk to other users from their own community. In the long-term, conflicts have adverse effects and reduce the overall activity of users in the targeted communities. Our analysis of user interactions also suggests strategies for mitigating the negative impact of conflicts---such as increasing direct engagement between attackers and defenders. Further, we accurately predict whether a conflict will occur by creating a novel LSTM model that combines graph embeddings, user, community, and text features. This model can be used toreate early-warning systems for community moderators to prevent conflicts. Altogether, this work presents a data-driven view of community interactions and conflict, and paves the way towards healthier online communities.

用户通过网络平台将自己组织到社区中。这些社区可以互相交流，经常导致冲突和有毒的相互作用。然而，人们对社区之间的互动机制以及它们如何影响用户的机制知之甚少。在这里，我们研究了Reddit上36,000个社区的社区间互动情况，研究了一个社区的用户被负面情绪动员的情况在另一个社区发表评论的情况。我们表明，这种冲突往往是由少数社区发起---少于1％的社区开始了74％的冲突。尽管冲突往往由高度活跃的社区成员发起，但他们是由活跃程度较低的成员执行的。我们发现冲突的特点是形成了回声室，用户主要与其他社区的用户交谈。从长远来看，冲突会产生不利影响，并减少目标社区用户的整体活动。我们对用户交互的分析也提出了缓解冲突负面影响的策略 - 例如增加攻击者和维护者之间的直接参与。此外，我们通过创建一个结合了图嵌入，用户，社区和文本特征的新型LSTM模型来准确预测是否会发生冲突。此模型可用于为社区版主创建预警系统以防止冲突。总而言之，这项工作提供了一个数据驱动的社区互动和冲突视图，并为更健康的在线社区铺平了道路。
