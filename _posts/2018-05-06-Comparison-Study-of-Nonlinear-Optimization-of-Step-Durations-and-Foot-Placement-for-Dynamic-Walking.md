##### Abstract
This paper studies bipedal locomotion as a nonlinear optimization problem based on continuous and discrete dynamics, by simultaneously optimizing the remaining step duration, the next step duration and the foot location to achieve robustness. The linear inverted pendulum as the motion model captures the center of mass dynamics and its low-dimensionality makes the problem more tractable. We first formulate a holistic approach to search for optimality in the three-dimensional parametric space and use these results as baseline. To further improve computational efficiency, our study investigates a sequential approach with two stages of customized optimization that first optimizes the current step duration, and subsequently the duration and location of the next step. The effectiveness of both approaches is successfully demonstrated in simulation by applying different perturbations. The comparison study shows that these two approaches find mostly the same optimal solutions, but the latter requires considerably less computational time, which suggests that the proposed sequential approach is well suited for real-time implementation with a minor trade-off in optimality.

本文研究基于连续和离散动力学的双足运动作为非线性优化问题，同时优化剩余步长，下一步持续时间和脚位以实现鲁棒性。作为运动模型的线性倒立摆捕捉质心动力学的中心，并且其低维度使问题更容易处理。我们首先制定一个全面的方法来搜索三维参数空间的最优性，并将这些结果用作基线。为了进一步提高计算效率，我们的研究调查了一种采用两阶段定制优化的顺序方法，首先优化当前阶段持续时间，然后再优化下一阶段的持续时间和位置。这两种方法的有效性通过应用不同的扰动在模拟中成功地展现出来。比较研究表明，这两种方法找到了大多数相同的最优解，但后者需要相当少的计算时间，这表明所提出的顺序方法非常适合实时实现，且具有最佳的最小折衷。
