##### Abstract
Large-scale artificial neural networks have demonstrated significantly better performance over other machine learning algorithms. However, the computational complexity of these networks precludes real-time operation. The ability of light to perform convolutions with extremely low-power and high speed make light a potential candidate to speed up complicated neural networks. In this paper we report an architecture of optical frontend for a neural network. We analyzed the performance of the whole hybrid optical-electronic neural network, and found that an optical frontend is beneficial when the number of pixels is large and exceeds 1000.
