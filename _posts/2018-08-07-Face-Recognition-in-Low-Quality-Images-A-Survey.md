##### Abstract
Low-resolution face recognition (LRFR) has received increasing attention over the past few years. Its applications lie widely in the real-world environment when high-resolution or high-quality images are hard to capture. One of the biggest demands for LRFR technologies is video surveillance. As the the number of surveillance cameras in the city increases, the videos that captured will need to be processed automatically. However, those videos or images are usually captured with large standoffs, arbitrary illumination condition, and diverse angles of view. Faces in these images are generally small in size. Several studies addressed this problem employed techniques like super resolution, deblurring, or learning a relationship between different resolution domains. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive review of approaches to low-resolution face recognition in the past five years. First, a general problem definition is given. Later, systematically analysis of the works on this topic is presented by catogory. In addition to describing the methods, we also focus on datasets and experiment settings. We further address the related works on unconstrained low-resolution face recognition and compare them with the result that use synthetic low-resolution data. Finally, we summarized the general limitations and speculate a priorities for the future effort.

##### Abstract (translated by Google)
低分辨率人脸识别（LRFR）在过去几年中受到越来越多的关注。当高分辨率或高质量图像难以捕捉时，其应用广泛存在于现实环境中。 LRFR技术的最大需求之一是视频监控。随着城市中监控摄像机的数量增加，捕获的视频将需要自动处理。然而，这些视频或图像通常以大型支架，任意照明条件和不同视角捕获。这些图像中的面部通常很小。一些研究解决了这个问题，采用了超分辨率，去模糊或学习不同分辨率域之间关系的技术。在本文中，我们对过去五年中低分辨率人脸识别方法进行了全面回顾。首先，给出了一般问题的定义。后来，通过catogory系统地分析了关于这个主题的着作。除了描述方法之外，我们还关注数据集和实验设置。我们进一步讨论了无约束低分辨率人脸识别的相关工作，并将其与使用合成低分辨率数据的结果进行了比较。最后，我们总结了一般限制，并推测未来工作的优先事项。
