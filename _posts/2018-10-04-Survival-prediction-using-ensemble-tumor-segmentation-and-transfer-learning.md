##### Abstract
Segmenting tumors and their subregions is a challenging task as demonstrated by the annual BraTS challenge. Moreover, predicting the survival of the patient using mainly imaging features, while being a desirable outcome to evaluate the treatment of the patient, it is also a difficult task. In this paper, we present a cascaded pipeline to segment the tumor and its subregions and then we use these results and other clinical features together with image features coming from a pretrained VGG-16 network to predict the survival of the patient. Preliminary results with the training and validation dataset show a promising start in terms of segmentation, while the prediction values could be improved with further testing on the feature extraction part of the network.
