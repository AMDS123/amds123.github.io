##### Abstract
Person re-identification (Re-ID) poses a unique challenge to deep learning: how to learn a deep model with millions of parameters on a small training set of few or no labels. In this paper, a number of deep transfer learning models are proposed to address the data sparsity problem. First, a deep network architecture is designed which differs from existing deep Re-ID models in that (a) it is more suitable for transferring representations learned from large image classification datasets, and (b) classification loss and verification loss are combined, each of which adopts a different dropout strategy. Second, a two-stepped fine-tuning strategy is developed to transfer knowledge from auxiliary datasets. Third, given an unlabelled Re-ID dataset, a novel unsupervised deep transfer learning model is developed based on co-training. The proposed models outperform the state-of-the-art deep Re-ID models by large margins: we achieve Rank-1 accuracy of 85.4\%, 83.7\% and 56.3\% on CUHK03, Market1501, and VIPeR respectively, whilst on VIPeR, our unsupervised model (45.1\%) beats most supervised models.

人员重新识别（Re-ID）对深度学习提出了一个独特的挑战：如何在一个很少或没有标签的小型训练集上学习一个具有数百万参数的深层模型。本文提出了一些深度传输学习模型来解决数据稀疏性问题。首先，设计一个深度网络架构，它不同于现有的深度Re-ID模型，因为（a）它更适合从大型图像分类数据集中学习表示，（b）分类损失和验证损失相结合，采取不同的辍学策略。其次，开发了两步微调策略来从辅助数据集转移知识。再次，给出了一个未标记的Re-ID数据集，在此基础上开发了一种新的无监督深度传递学习模型。所提出的模型的性能优于最先进的深度Re-ID模型，我们在CUHK03，Market1501和VIPeR上分别达到了85.4％，83.7％和56.3％的Rank-1准确率， VIPeR，我们的无监督模型（45.1 \％）击败了大多数监督模型。
