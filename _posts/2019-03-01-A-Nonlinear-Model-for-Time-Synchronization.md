##### Abstract
The current algorithms are based on linear model, for example, Precision Time Protocol (PTP) which requires frequent synchronization in order to handle the effects of clock frequency drift. This paper introduces a nonlinear approach to clock time synchronize. This approach can accurately model the frequency shift. Therefore, the required time interval to synchronize clocks can be longer. Meanwhile, it also offers better performance and relaxes the synchronization process. The idea of the nonlinear algorithm and some numerical examples will be presented in this paper in detail.
