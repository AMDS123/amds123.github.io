##### Abstract
We present Monte Carlo simulation data obtained for the annealed surface GaN(0001) and compare them with the experimental data. High temperature particle evaporation is a part of substrate preparation processes before epitaxy. The ideal surface ordering expected after such heating is a pattern of parallel, equally distanced steps. It appears however, that different types of step structures emerge at high temperatures. We show how the creation of characteristic patterns depends on the temperature and the annealing time. The first pattern is created for a very short evaporation time and consists of rough steps. The second pattern built by curly steps is characteristic for longer evaporation times and lower temperatures. The third pattern, in which steps merge together creating bunches of steps happens for the long enough time. At higher temperatures, bunches of steps bend into the wavy-like structures.
