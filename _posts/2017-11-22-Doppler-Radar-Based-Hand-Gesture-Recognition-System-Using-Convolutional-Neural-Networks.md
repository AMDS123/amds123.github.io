##### Abstract
Hand gesture recognition has long been a hot topic in human computer interaction. Traditional camera-based hand gesture recognition systems cannot work properly under dark circumstances. In this paper, a Doppler Radar based hand gesture recognition system using convolutional neural networks is proposed. A cost-effective Doppler radar sensor with dual receiving channels at 5.8GHz is used to acquire a big database of four standard gestures. The received hand gesture signals are then processed with time-frequency analysis. Convolutional neural networks are used to classify different gestures. Experimental results verify the effectiveness of the system with an accuracy of 98%. Besides, related factors such as recognition distance and gesture scale are investigated.

手势识别一直是人机交互的热门话题。在黑暗环境下，传统的基于相机的手势识别系统无法正常工作。本文提出了一种基于多普勒雷达的卷积神经网络手势识别系统。采用具有5.8GHz双接收通道的经济型多普勒雷达传感器来获取四个标准手势的大型数据库。接收到的手势信号随后通过时频分析进行处理。卷积神经网络用于分类不同的手势。实验结果验证了系统的有效性，准确率为98％。此外还研究了识别距离和手势尺度等相关因素。
