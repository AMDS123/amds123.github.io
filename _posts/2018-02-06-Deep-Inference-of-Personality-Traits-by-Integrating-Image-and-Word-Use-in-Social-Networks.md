##### Abstract
Social media, as a major platform for communication and information exchange, is a rich repository of the opinions and sentiments of 2.3 billion users about a vast spectrum of topics. To sense the whys of certain social user's demands and cultural-driven interests, however, the knowledge embedded in the 1.8 billion pictures which are uploaded daily in public profiles has just started to be exploited since this process has been typically been text-based. Following this trend on visual-based social analysis, we present a novel methodology based on Deep Learning to build a combined image-and-text based personality trait model, trained with images posted together with words found highly correlated to specific personality traits. So the key contribution here is to explore whether OCEAN personality trait modeling can be addressed based on images, here called \emph{Mind{P}ics}, appearing with certain tags with psychological insights. We found that there is a correlation between those posted images and their accompanying texts, which can be successfully modeled using deep neural networks for personality estimation. The experimental results are consistent with previous cyber-psychology results based on texts or images. In addition, classification results on some traits show that some patterns emerge in the set of images corresponding to a specific text, in essence to those representing an abstract concept. These results open new avenues of research for further refining the proposed personality model under the supervision of psychology experts.

社交媒体作为沟通和信息交流的主要平台，是丰富的23亿用户关于广泛话题的观点和观点库。然而，为了感知某些社交用户的需求和文化驱动的兴趣，每日上传至公开个人资料的18亿图片中嵌入的知识刚刚开始被利用，因为该过程通常基于文本。在这种基于视觉的社会分析趋势之后，我们提出了一种基于深度学习的新颖方法，以建立一个基于图像和文本的人格特质模型，通过将图像与发现与特定人格特征高度相关的单词进行训练。因此，这里的主要贡献是探索OCEAN人格特质建模是否可以基于图像进行处理，这里称为\ emph {Mind {P} ics}，出现一些具有心理洞察力的标签。我们发现这些张贴的图像及其附带的文本之间存在相关性，可以使用深度神经网络成功建模人格估计。实验结果与之前基于文本或图像的网络心理学结果一致。此外，对某些特征的分类结果表明，某些图案出现在与特定文本相对应的图像集合中，实质上表现为抽象概念的那些图案。这些结果为心理学专家在监督下进一步完善提出的人格模型开辟了新的研究途径。
