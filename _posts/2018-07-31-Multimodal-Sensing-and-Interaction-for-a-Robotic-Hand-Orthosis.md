##### Abstract
Wearable robotic hand rehabilitation devices can allow greater freedom and flexibility than their workstation-like counterparts. However, the field is generally lacking effective methods by which the user can operate the device: such controls must be effective, intuitive and robust to the wide range of possible impairment patterns. Even when focusing on a specific condition, such as stroke, the variety of encountered upper limb impairment patterns means that a single sensing modality, such as electromyography (EMG), is not sufficient to enable controls for a broad range of users. To address this significant gap, we introduce a multimodal sensing and interaction paradigm for an active hand orthosis. In our proof-of-concept implementation, EMG is complemented by other sensing modalities, such as finger bend and contact pressure sensors. We propose multimodal interaction methods that utilize this sensory data as input, and show they can enable tasks for stroke survivors who exhibit different impairment patterns. We believe that robotic hand orthoses developed as multimodal sensory platforms with help address some of the key challenges in physical interaction with the user.

可穿戴机器人手部康复设备可以比其类似工作站的设备具有更大的自由度和灵活性。然而，该领域通常缺乏用户可以操作设备的有效方法：这种控制对于各种可能的损伤模式必须是有效的，直观的和鲁棒的。即使在关注特定情况（例如中风）时，遇到的各种上肢损伤模式意味着单个感测模态（例如肌电图（EMG））不足以实现对广泛用户的控制。为了解决这一重大差距，我们为主动手矫形器引入了多模态感知和交互范例。在我们的概念验证实现中，EMG还辅以其他传感模式，例如手指弯曲和接触压力传感器。我们提出了利用这种感觉数据作为输入的多模态交互方法，并且表明它们可以为表现出不同损伤模式的中风幸存者启用任务。我们相信机器人手矫形器是作为多模态感觉平台开发的，有助于解决与用户进行物理交互时的一些关键挑战。
