##### Abstract
This work proposes a system for retrieving clothing and fashion products from video content. Although films and television are the perfect showcase for fashion brands to promote their products, spectators are not always aware of where to buy the latest trends they see on screen. Here, a framework for breaking the gap between fashion products shown on videos and users is presented. By relating clothing items and video frames in an indexed database and performing frame retrieval with temporal aggregation and fast indexing techniques, we can find fashion products from videos in a simple and non-intrusive way. Experiments in a large-scale dataset conducted here show that, by using the proposed framework, memory requirements can be reduced by 42.5X with respect to linear search, whereas accuracy is maintained at around 90%.

这项工作提出了一个从视频内容检索服装和时尚产品的系统。虽然电影和电视是时尚品牌推广产品的完美展示，但观众并不总是知道在哪里购买他们在屏幕上看到的最新趋势。展示了打破视频和用户所展示的时尚产品之间差距的框架。通过将索引数据库中的服装项目和视频帧相关联，并利用时间聚合和快速索引技术进行帧检索，我们可以以简单而不侵入的方式从视频中找到时尚产品。在这里进行的大规模数据集的实验表明，通过使用所提出的框架，对于线性搜索，存储器需求可以减少42.5倍，而准确度保持在90％左右。
