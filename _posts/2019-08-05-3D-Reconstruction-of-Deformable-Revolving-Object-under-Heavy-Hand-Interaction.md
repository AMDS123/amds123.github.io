##### Abstract
We reconstruct 3D deformable object through time, in the context of a live pottery making process where the crafter molds the object. Because the object suffers from heavy hand interaction, and is being deformed, classical techniques cannot be applied. We use particle energy optimization to estimate the object profile and benefit of the object radial symmetry to increase the robustness of the reconstruction to both occlusion and noise. Our method works with an unconstrained scalable setup with one or more depth sensors. We evaluate on our database (released upon publication) on a per-frame and temporal basis and shows it significantly outperforms state-of-the-art achieving 7.60mm average object reconstruction error. Further ablation studies demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.
