##### Abstract
Segmenting stroke lesions from T1-weighted MR images is of great value for large-scale stroke rehabilitation neuroimaging analyses. Nevertheless, there are great challenges with this task, such as large range of stroke lesion scales and the tissue intensity similarity. The famous encoder-decoder convolutional neural network, which although has made great achievements in medical image segmentation areas, may fail to address these challenges due to the insufficient uses of multi-scale features and context information. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a Cross-Level fusion and Context Inference Network (CLCI-Net) for the chronic stroke lesion segmentation from T1-weighted MR images. Specifically, a Cross-Level feature Fusion (CLF) strategy was developed to make full use of different scale features across different levels; Extending Atrous Spatial Pyramid Pooling (ASPP) with CLF, we have enriched multi-scale features to handle the different lesion sizes; In addition, convolutional long short-term memory (ConvLSTM) is employed to infer context information and thus capture fine structures to address the intensity similarity issue. The proposed approach was evaluated on an open-source dataset, the Anatomical Tracings of Lesions After Stroke (ATLAS) with the results showing that our network outperforms five state-of-the-art methods. We make our code and models available at https://github.com/YH0517/CLCI_Net.
