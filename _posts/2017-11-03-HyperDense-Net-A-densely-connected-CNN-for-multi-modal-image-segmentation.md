##### Abstract
Neonatal brain segmentation in magnetic resonance (MR) is a challenging problem due to poor image quality and similar levels of intensity between white and gray matter in MR-T1 and T2 images. To tackle this problem, most existing approaches are based on multi-atlas label fusion strategies, which are time-consuming and sensitive to registration errors. As alternative to these methods, we propose a hyper densely connected 3D convolutional neural network that employs MR-T1 and T2 as input, processed independently in two separated paths. A main difference with respect to previous densely connected networks is the use of direct connections between layers from the same and different paths. Adopting such dense connectivity leads to a benefit from a learning perspective thanks to: i) including deep supervision and ii) improving gradient flow. This approach has been evaluated in the MICCAI grand Challenge iSEG and obtains very competitive results among 21 teams, ranking first and second in many metrics, which translates into a promising performance.

磁共振（MR）中的新生儿脑部分割是一个具有挑战性的问题，因为在MR-T1和T2图像中白色和灰色物质之间的图像质量差和强度相似。为了解决这个问题，大多数现有的方法都是基于多图册标签融合策略，这些策略耗时且对注册错误敏感。作为这些方法的替代方案，我们提出了一种高密度连接的三维卷积神经网络，它使用MR-T1和T2作为输入，在两个分开的路径上独立处理。与先前密集连接的网络的主要区别在于使用来自相同和不同路径的层之间的直接连接。采用如此密集的连通性可以从学习的角度得益，这要归功于：i）包括深度监督和ii）改善梯度流动。这个方法已经在MICCAI的挑战赛iSEG中进行了评估，在21支球队中取得了非常有竞争力的成绩，在许多指标中排名第一，排名第二，这意味着前景看好。
