##### Abstract
In the area of data classification, the different classifiers have been developed by its own strengths and weaknesses. Among these classifiers, we propose a method which is based on the maximum margin between two classes. One of the main challenges in this area is dealt with noisy data. In this paper, our aim is to optimize the method of large margin classifier based on hyperdisk (LMC-HD) and incorporate it into quasi-support vector data description (QSVDD) method. In the proposed method, the bounding hypersphere is calculated based on the QSVDD method. So our convex class model is more robust in compared with support vector machine (SVM) and less tight than LMC-HD. Applying this idea causes the reduction of the impact of the noisy data set in classification. Large margin classifiers aim to maximize the margin and minimizing the risk. Sine our proposed method ignores the effect of outliers and noises, so this method has the widest margin compared with other large margin classifiers. In the end, we compare our proposed method with other popular large margin classifiers by the experiments on a set of standard data which indicates our results are more efficient than the others.
