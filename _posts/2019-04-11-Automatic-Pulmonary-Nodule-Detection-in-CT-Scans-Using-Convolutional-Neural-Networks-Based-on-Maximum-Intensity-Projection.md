##### Abstract
Accurate pulmonary nodule detection in computed tomography scans is a crucial step in lung cancer screening. Computer-aided detection (CAD) systems are not routinely used by radiologists for pulmonary nodules detection in clinical practice despite their potential benefits. Maximum intensity projection (MIP) images improve the detection of pulmonary nodules in radiological evaluation with computed tomography (CT) scans. In this work, we aim to explore the feasibility of utilizing MIP images to improve the effectiveness of automatic detection of lung nodules by convolutional neural networks (CNNs). We propose a CNN based approach that takes MIP images of different slab thicknesses (5 mm, 10 mm, 15 mm) and 1mm plain multiplanar reconstruction (MPR) images as input. Such an approach augments the 2-D CT slice images with more representative spatial information that helps in the discriminating nodules from vessels through their morphologies. We use the public available LUNA16 set collected from seven academic centers to train and test our approach. Our proposed method achieves a sensitivity of 91.13% with 1 false positive per scan and a sensitivity of 94.13% with 4 false positives per scan for lung nodule detection in this dataset. Using the thick MIP images helps the detection of small pulmonary nodules (3mm-10mm) and acquires fewer false positives. Experimental results show that applying MIP images can increase the sensitivity and lower the number of false positive, which demonstrates the effectiveness and significance of the proposed maximum intensity projection based CNN framework for automatic pulmonary nodule detection in CT scans.
