##### Abstract
Chinese word segmentation (CWS) is often regarded as a character-based sequence labeling task in most current works which have achieved great performance by leveraging powerful neural networks. However, these works neglect an important clue: Chinese characters contain both semantic and phonetic meanings. In this paper, we introduce multiple character embeddings including Pinyin Romanization and Wubi Input, both of which are easily accessible and effective in depicting semantics of characters. To fully leverage them, we propose a novel shared Bi-LSTM-CRF model, which fuses multiple features efficiently. Extensive experiments on five corpora demonstrate that extra embeddings help obtain a significant improvement.

中文分词（CWS）通常被认为是大多数当前作品中基于字符的序列标记任务，它通过利用强大的神经网络获得了很好的性能。然而，这些作品忽略了一个重要线索：汉字包含语义和语音意义。在本文中，我们介绍了多种字符嵌入，包括拼音罗马化和五笔输入，这两种字符嵌入都易于访问并且有效地描绘了字符的语义。为了充分利用它们，我们提出了一种新颖的共享Bi-LSTM-CRF模型，它可以有效地融合多种功能。对五个语料库进行的大量实验表明，额外的嵌入有助于获得显着的改进。
