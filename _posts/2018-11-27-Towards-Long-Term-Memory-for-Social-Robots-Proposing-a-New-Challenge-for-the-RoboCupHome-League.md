##### Abstract
Long-term memory is essential to feel like a continuous being, and to be able to interact/communicate coherently. Social robots need long-term memories in order to establish long-term relationships with humans and other robots, and do not act just for the moment. In this paper this challenge is highlighted, open questions are identified, the need of addressing this challenge in the RoboCup@Home League with new tests is motivated, and a new test is proposed.
