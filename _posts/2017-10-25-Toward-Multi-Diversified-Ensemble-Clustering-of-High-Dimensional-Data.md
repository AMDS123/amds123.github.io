##### Abstract
The emergence of high-dimensional data in various areas has brought new challenges to the ensemble clustering research. To deal with the curse of dimensionality, considerable efforts in ensemble clustering have been made by incorporating various subspace-based techniques. Besides the emphasis on subspaces, rather limited attention has been paid to the potential diversity in similarity/dissimilarity metrics. It remains a surprisingly open problem in ensemble clustering how to create and aggregate a large number of diversified metrics, and furthermore, how to jointly exploit the multi-level diversity in the large number of metrics, subspaces, and clusters, in a unified framework. To tackle this problem, this paper proposes a novel multi-diversified ensemble clustering approach. In particular, we create a large number of diversified metrics by randomizing a scaled exponential similarity kernel, which are then coupled with random subspaces to form a large set of metric-subspace pairs. Based on the similarity matrices derived from these metric-subspace pairs, an ensemble of diversified base clusterings can thereby be constructed. Further, an entropy-based criterion is adopted to explore the cluster-wise diversity in ensembles, based on which the consensus function is therefore presented. Experimental results on twenty high-dimensional datasets have confirmed the superiority of our approach over the state-of-the-art.

高维数据在各个领域的出现给整体聚类研究带来了新的挑战。为了处理维度的诅咒，通过结合各种基于子空间的技术已经在集合聚类上做了相当大的努力。除了强调子空间之外，对相似性/相异性度量的潜在差异性的注意力相当有限。如何建立和聚合大量多样化的度量标准，如何在统一的框架下共同开发大量度量，子空间和集群的多层次多样性，仍然是一个令人惊讶的开放性问题。为了解决这个问题，本文提出了一种新的多元化集成聚类方法。具体而言，我们通过随机化缩放的指数相似性内核来创建大量的多样化度量，然后将这些随机子空间与随机子空间相结合，形成一组度量子空间对。基于从这些度量 - 子空间对导出的相似性矩阵，可以由此构建多样化的基本聚类的集合。此外，还采用基于熵的准则来探讨集合中的集群式多样性，并据此提出共识函数。对20个高维数据集的实验结果证实了我们的方法优于最先进的技术。
