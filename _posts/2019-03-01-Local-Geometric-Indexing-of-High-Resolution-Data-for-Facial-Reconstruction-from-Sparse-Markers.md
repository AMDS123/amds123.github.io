##### Abstract
When considering sparse motion capture marker data, one typically struggles to balance its overfitting via a high dimensional blendshape system versus underfitting caused by smoothness constraints. With the current trend towards using more and more data, our aim is not to fit the motion capture markers with a parameterized (blendshape) model or to smoothly interpolate a surface through the marker positions, but rather to find an instance in the high resolution dataset that contains local geometry to fit each marker. Just as is true for typical machine learning applications, this approach benefits from a plethora of data, and thus we also consider augmenting the dataset via specially designed physical simulations that target the high resolution dataset such that the simulation output lies on the same so-called manifold as the data targeted.
