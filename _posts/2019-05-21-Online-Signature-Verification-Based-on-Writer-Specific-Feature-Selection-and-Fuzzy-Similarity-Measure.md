##### Abstract
Online Signature Verification (OSV) is a widely used biometric attribute for user behavioral characteristic verification in digital forensics. In this manuscript, owing to large intra-individual variability, a novel method for OSV based on an interval symbolic representation and a fuzzy similarity measure grounded on writer specific parameter selection is proposed. The two parameters, namely, writer specific acceptance threshold and optimal feature set to be used for authenticating the writer are selected based on minimum equal error rate (EER) attained during parameter fixation phase using the training signature samples. This is in variation to current techniques for OSV, which are primarily writer independent, in which a common set of features and acceptance threshold are chosen. To prove the robustness of our system, we have exhaustively assessed our system with four standard datasets i.e. MCYT-100 (DB1), MCYT-330 (DB2), SUSIG-Visual corpus and SVC-2004- Task2. Experimental outcome confirms the effectiveness of fuzzy similarity metric-based writer dependent parameter selection for OSV by achieving a lower error rate as compared to many recent and state-of-the art OSV models.
