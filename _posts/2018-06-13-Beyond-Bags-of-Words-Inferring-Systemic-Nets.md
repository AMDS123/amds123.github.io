##### Abstract
Textual analytics based on representations of documents as bags of words have been reasonably successful. However, analysis that requires deeper insight into language, into author properties, or into the contexts in which documents were created requires a richer representation. Systemic nets are one such representation. They have not been extensively used because they required human effort to construct. We show that systemic nets can be algorithmically inferred from corpora, that the resulting nets are plausible, and that they can provide practical benefits for knowledge discovery problems. This opens up a new class of practical analysis techniques for textual analytics.

基于文档表示形式的文本分析已经相当成功。然而，需要深入了解语言，作者属性或创建文档的上下文的分析需要更丰富的表示形式。系统网络就是这样一种表示。他们没有被广泛使用，因为他们需要人力来建设。我们表明，系统网络可以从语料库算法推断，由此产生的网络似乎是合理的，并且他们可以为知识发现问题提供实际利益。这为文本分析开辟了一类新的实用分析技术。
