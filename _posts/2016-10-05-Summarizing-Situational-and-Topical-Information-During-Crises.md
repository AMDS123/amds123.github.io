##### Abstract
The use of microblogging platforms such as Twitter during crises has become widespread. More importantly, information disseminated by affected people contains useful information like reports of missing and found people, requests for urgent needs etc. For rapid crisis response, humanitarian organizations look for situational awareness information to understand and assess the severity of the crisis. In this paper, we present a novel framework (i) to generate abstractive summaries useful for situational awareness, and (ii) to capture sub-topics and present a short informative summary for each of these topics. A summary is generated using a two stage framework that first extracts a set of important tweets from the whole set of information through an Integer-linear programming (ILP) based optimization technique and then follows a word graph and concept event based abstractive summarization technique to produce the final summary. High accuracies obtained for all the tasks show the effectiveness of the proposed framework.

##### Abstract (translated by Google)
危机期间使用Twitter等微博平台已经变得普遍。更重要的是，受灾群众传播的信息包含失踪人员，紧急需求等有用信息。为了快速应对危机，人道主义组织寻找情境意识信息，以了解和评估危机的严重程度。在本文中，我们提出了一个新颖的框架：（i）产生对情景意识有用的抽象摘要，（ii）捕捉子主题，并为每个主题提供一个简短的信息摘要。摘要是使用两阶段框架生成的，首先通过基于整数线性规划（ILP）的优化技术从整个信息集合中提取一组重要的推文，然后遵循基于词图和概念事件的抽象概括技术来产生最后的总结。所有任务获得的高准确度显示了拟议框架的有效性。
