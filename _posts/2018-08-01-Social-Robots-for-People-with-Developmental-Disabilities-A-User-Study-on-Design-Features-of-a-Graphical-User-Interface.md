##### Abstract
Social robots, also known as service or assistant robots, have been developed to improve the quality of human life in recent years. The design of socially capable and intelligent robots can vary, depending on the target user groups. In this work, we assess the effect of social robots' roles, functions, and communication approaches in the context of a social agent providing service or entertainment to users with developmental disabilities. In this paper, we describe an exploratory study of interface design for a social robot that assists people suffering from developmental disabilities. We developed series of prototypes and tested one in a user study that included three residents with various function levels. This entire study had been recorded for the following qualitative data analysis. Results show that each design factor played a different role in delivering information and in increasing engagement. We also note that some of the fundamental design principles that would work for ordinary users did not apply to our target user group. We conclude that social robots could benefit our target users, and acknowledge that these robots were not suitable for certain scenarios based on the feedback from our users.

近年来，社会机器人也被称为服务或助手机器人，以改善人类生活质量。具有社交能力和智能的机器人的设计可以根据目标用户群而变化。在这项工作中，我们评估社交机器人在为有发育障碍的用户提供服务或娱乐的社交代理环境中的角色，功能和沟通方法的影响。在本文中，我们描述了一种社交机器人界面设计的探索性研究，该机器人帮助患有发育障碍的人。我们开发了一系列原型并在用户研究中测试了一个，其中包括三个具有不同功能水平的居民。已记录整个研究用于以下定性数据分析。结果表明，每个设计因素在提供信息和增加参与度方面发挥着不同的作用。我们还注意到，一些适用于普通用户的基本设计原则并不适用于我们的目标用户组。我们得出结论，社交机器人可以使我们的目标用户受益，并承认这些机器人不适合基于我们用户反馈的某些场景。
