##### Abstract
The paper gives an overview of the Russian Semantic Similarity Evaluation (RUSSE) shared task held in conjunction with the Dialogue 2015 conference. There exist a lot of comparative studies on semantic similarity, yet no analysis of such measures was ever performed for the Russian language. Exploring this problem for the Russian language is even more interesting, because this language has features, such as rich morphology and free word order, which make it significantly different from English, German, and other well-studied languages. We attempt to bridge this gap by proposing a shared task on the semantic similarity of Russian nouns. Our key contribution is an evaluation methodology based on four novel benchmark datasets for the Russian language. Our analysis of the 105 submissions from 19 teams reveals that successful approaches for English, such as distributional and skip-gram models, are directly applicable to Russian as well. On the one hand, the best results in the contest were obtained by sophisticated supervised models that combine evidence from different sources. On the other hand, completely unsupervised approaches, such as a skip-gram model estimated on a large-scale corpus, were able score among the top 5 systems.

本文概述了与2015年对话大会共同举办的俄语语义相似性评估（RUSSE）共享任务。对语义相似性进行了大量的比较研究，但没有对俄语进行过这种措施的分析。为俄语探索这个问题更加有趣，因为这种语言具有丰富的形态和自由的词序等特征，这使得它与英语，德语和其他经过深入研究的语言显着不同。我们试图通过提出关于俄语名词语义相似性的共同任务来缩小这个差距。我们的主要贡献是基于四种俄语新颖基准数据集的评估方法。我们对来自19个团队的105份意见书的分析表明，英语的成功方法，如分配和跳跃模型，也直接适用于俄罗斯。一方面，比赛中的最佳成绩是通过结合不同来源证据的先进监督模式获得的。另一方面，完全无监督的方法，比如在大型语料库上估计的skip-gram模型，在前五个系统中得分最高。
