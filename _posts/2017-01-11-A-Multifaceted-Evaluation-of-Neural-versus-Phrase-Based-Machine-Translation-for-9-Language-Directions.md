##### Abstract
We aim to shed light on the strengths and weaknesses of the newly introduced neural machine translation paradigm. To that end, we conduct a multifaceted evaluation in which we compare outputs produced by state-of-the-art neural machine translation and phrase-based machine translation systems for 9 language directions across a number of dimensions. Specifically, we measure the similarity of the outputs, their fluency and amount of reordering, the effect of sentence length and performance across different error categories. We find out that translations produced by neural machine translation systems are considerably different, more fluent and more accurate in terms of word order compared to those produced by phrase-based systems. Neural machine translation systems are also more accurate at producing inflected forms, but they perform poorly when translating very long sentences.

我们的目标是阐明新引入的神经机器翻译范式的优缺点。为此，我们进行了一个多方面的评估，在这个评估中，我们比较了最先进的神经机器翻译和基于短语的机器翻译系统在多个维度上的9个语言方向产生的输出。具体而言，我们测量输出的相似性，流畅性和重新排序的量，句子长度和性能对不同错误类别的影响。我们发现，由神经机器翻译系统产生的翻译与由基于短语的系统产生的翻译相比，在词序方面差别很大，更流畅，更准确。神经机器翻译系统在生成变形形式时也更加精确，但是当翻译很长的句子时，它们表现不佳。
