##### Abstract
This paper presents a model-free, setting-independent method for online detection of dynamic objects in 3D lidar data. We explicitly compensate for the moving-while-scanning operation (motion distortion) of present-day 3D spinning lidar sensors. Our detection method uses a motion-compensated freespace querying algorithm and classifies between dynamic (currently moving) and static (currently stationary) labels at the point level. For a quantitative analysis, we establish a benchmark with motion-distorted lidar data using CARLA, an open-source simulator for autonomous driving research. We also provide a qualitative analysis with real data using a Velodyne HDL-64E in driving scenarios. Compared to existing 3D lidar methods that are model-free, our method is unique because of its setting independence and compensation for pointcloud motion distortion.
