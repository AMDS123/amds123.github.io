##### Abstract
This paper describes technology developed to automatically grade Italian students (ages 9-16) on their English and German spoken language proficiency. The students' spoken answers are first transcribed by an automatic speech recognition (ASR) system and then scored using a feedforward neural network (NN) that processes features extracted from the automatic transcriptions. In-domain acoustic models, employing deep neural networks (DNNs), are derived by adapting the parameters of an original out of domain DNN.
