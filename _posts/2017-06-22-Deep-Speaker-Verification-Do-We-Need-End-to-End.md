##### Abstract
End-to-end learning treats the entire system as a whole adaptable black box, which, if sufficient data are available, may learn a system that works very well for the target task. This principle has recently been applied to several prototype research on speaker verification (SV), where the feature learning and classifier are learned together with an objective function that is consistent with the evaluation metric. An opposite approach to end-to-end is feature learning, which firstly trains a feature learning model, and then constructs a back-end classifier separately to perform SV. Recently, both approaches achieved significant performance gains on SV, mainly attributed to the smart utilization of deep neural networks. However, the two approaches have not been carefully compared, and their respective advantages have not been well discussed. In this paper, we compare the end-to-end and feature learning approaches on a text-independent SV task. Our experiments on a dataset sampled from the Fisher database and involving 5,000 speakers demonstrated that the feature learning approach outperformed the end-to-end approach. This is a strong support for the feature learning approach, at least with data and computation resources similar to ours.

端到端学习将整个系统作为一个整体适应黑匣子，如果有足够的数据可用，可以学习一个对目标任务非常有效的系统。最近，这个原理被应用于说话人验证（SV）的几个原型研究，其中特征学习和分类器被与一个与评估度量一致的目标函数一起学习。端到端的相反方法是特征学习，首先训练特征学习模型，然后分别构建后端分类器来执行SV。最近，这两种方法在SV上取得了显着的性能提升，这主要归功于深度神经网络的智能利用。然而，这两种方法并没有仔细比较，各自的优点没有得到很好的讨论。在本文中，我们比较了文本无关SV任务的端到端和特征学习方法。我们对从Fisher数据库采集的数据集进行的实验结果表明，特征学习方法优于端对端方法。这是对特征学习方法的有力支持，至少在数据和计算资源方面与我们类似。
