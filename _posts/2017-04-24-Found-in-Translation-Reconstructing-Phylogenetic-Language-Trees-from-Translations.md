##### Abstract
Translation has played an important role in trade, law, commerce, politics, and literature for thousands of years. Translators have always tried to be invisible; ideal translations should look as if they were written originally in the target language. We show that traces of the source language remain in the translation product to the extent that it is possible to uncover the history of the source language by looking only at the translation. Specifically, we automatically reconstruct phylogenetic language trees from monolingual texts (translated from several source languages). The signal of the source language is so powerful that it is retained even after two phases of translation. This strongly indicates that source language interference is the most dominant characteristic of translated texts, overshadowing the more subtle signals of universal properties of translation.

翻译在数千年来在贸易，法律，商业，政治和文学方面发挥了重要作用。译者一直试图隐藏;理想的翻译应该看起来好像他们原本是用目标语言写的。我们表明，源语言的痕迹留在翻译产品中，只有通过翻译才能发现源语言的历史。具体而言，我们自动从单语文本（从几种源语言翻译）重建系统发育语言树。源语言的信号非常强大，甚至在翻译的两个阶段之后仍然保留。这强烈地表明，源语言干扰是翻译文本中最主要的特征，掩盖了翻译的普遍属性的更微妙的信号。
