##### Abstract
Knowledge graphs encode uniquely identifiable entities to other entities or literal values by means of relationships, thus enabling semantically rich querying over the stored data. Typically, the semantics of such queries are often crisp thereby resulting in crisp answers. Query log statistics show that a majority of the queries issued to knowledge graphs are often entity centric queries. When a user needs additional answers the state-of-the-art in assisting users is to rewrite the original query resulting in a set of approximations. Several strategies have been proposed in past to address this. They typically move up the taxonomy to relax a specific element to a more generic element. Entities don't have a taxonomy and they end up being generalized. To address this issue, in this paper, we propose an entity centric reformulation strategy that utilizes schema information and entity features present in the graph to suggest rewrites. Once the features are identified, the entity in concern is reformulated as a set of features. Since entities can have a large number of features, we introduce strategies that select the top-k most relevant and {informative ranked features and augment them to the original query to create a valid reformulation. We then evaluate our approach by showing that our reformulation strategy produces results that are more informative when compared with state-of-the-art

##### Abstract (translated by Google)
知识图通过关系将唯一可识别实体编码为其他实体或文字值，从而实现对存储数据的语义丰富查询。通常，这种查询的语义通常很清晰，从而产生清晰的答案。查询日志统计信息显示发布到知识图的大多数查询通常是以实体为中心的查询。当用户需要额外的答案时，协助用户的最新技术是重写原始查询，从而产生一组近似值。过去已经提出了几种策略来解决这个问题。它们通常会向上移动分类法以将特定元素放宽到更通用的元素。实体没有分类法，最终会被推广。为了解决这个问题，在本文中，我们提出了一种以实体为中心的重构策略，该策略利用图中存在的模式信息和实体特征来建议重写。一旦识别出特征，就将所关注的实体重新表述为一组特征。由于实体可以具有大量特征，因此我们引入策略来选择前k最相关和{信息丰富的排名特征，并将它们扩展到原始查询以创建有效的重构。然后，我们通过证明我们的重新制定策略与最先进的技术相比产生更具信息量的结果来评估我们的方法
