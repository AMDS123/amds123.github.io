##### Abstract
The evolution of the internet has created an abundance of unstructured data on the web, a significant part of which is textual. The task of author profiling seeks to find the demographics of people solely from their linguistic and content-based features in text. The ability to describe traits of authors clearly has applications in fields such as security and forensics, as well as marketing. Instead of seeing age as just a classification problem, we also frame age as a regression one, but use an ensemble chain method that incorporates the power of both classification and regression to learn the authors exact age.

##### Abstract (translated by Google)
互联网的发展在网络上创造了大量的非结构化数据，其中很大一部分是文本的。作者简介的任务是试图从文本中的语言和内容为基础的特征来找到人口的统计特征。描述作者特征的能力显然在诸如安全和取证以及市场营销等领域都有应用。我们不把年龄看作是一个分类问题，而是将年龄定义为一个回归分类问题，而是使用集成分类和回归的力量的集合链方法来学习作者的确切年龄。
