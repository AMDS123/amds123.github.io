##### Abstract
Recently, width-based planning methods have been shown to yield state-of-the-art results in the Atari 2600 video games. For this, the states were associated with the (RAM) memory states of the simulator. In this work, we consider the same planning problem but using the screen instead. By using the same visual inputs, the planning results can be compared with those of humans and learning methods. We show that the planning approach, out of the box and without training, results in scores that compare well with those obtained by humans and learning methods, and moreover, by developing an episodic, rollout version of the IW(k) algorithm, we show that such scores can be obtained in almost real time.

最近，基于宽度的规划方法已被证明在Atari 2600视频游戏中获得了最新的成果。为此，状态与模拟器的（RAM）存储器状态相关联。在这项工作中，我们考虑相同的计划问题，而是使用屏幕来代替。通过使用相同的视觉输入，可以将计划结果与人类和学习方法进行比较。我们表明，规划方法，开箱即用，没有训练，得到的结果与那些通过人类和学习方法获得的得分相比，而且通过开发IW（k）算法的偶发版本，我们展示这样的分数几乎可以实时获得。
