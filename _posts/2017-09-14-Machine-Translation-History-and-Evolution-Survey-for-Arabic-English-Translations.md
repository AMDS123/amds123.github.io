##### Abstract
As a result of the rapid changes in information and communication technology (ICT), the world has become a small village where people from all over the world connect with each other in dialogue and communication via the Internet. Also, communications have become a daily routine activity due to the new globalization where companies and even universities become global residing cross countries borders. As a result, translation becomes a needed activity in this connected world. ICT made it possible to have a student in one country take a course or even a degree from a different country anytime anywhere easily. The resulted communication still needs a language as a means that helps the receiver understands the contents of the sent message. People need an automated translation application because human translators are hard to find all the times, and the human translations are very expensive comparing to the translations automated process. Several types of research describe the electronic process of the Machine-Translation. In this paper, the authors are going to study some of these previous researches, and they will explore some of the needed tools for the Machine-Translation. This research is going to contribute to the Machine-Translation area by helping future researchers to have a summary for the Machine-Translation groups of research and to let lights on the importance of the translation mechanism.

##### Abstract (translated by Google)
由于信息通信技术（ICT）的迅速变化，世界已经成为世界各地的人们通过互联网进行对话和交流的小村庄。而且，由于新的全球化，公司甚至大学成为全球居住的跨国界，通信已经成为日常活动。因此，翻译成为这个相互联系的世界所需要的活动。信息和通信技术让一个国家的学生能够随时随地从不同的国家获得课程甚至学位。所产生的通信仍然需要一种语言来帮助接收者理解发送的消息的内容。人们需要一个自动化的翻译应用程序，因为翻译人员很难找到所有的时间，而且与翻译自动化过程相比，人工翻译是非常昂贵的。几种类型的研究描述了机器翻译的电子过程。在本文中，作者将研究以前的一些研究成果，并将探索机器翻译所需的一些工具。这项研究将有助于机器翻译领域，帮助未来的研究人员总结机器翻译研究小组，并让翻译机制的重要性点亮。
