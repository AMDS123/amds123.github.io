##### Abstract
This paper presents a novel approach for learning self-awareness models for autonomous vehicles. The proposed technique is based on the availability of synchronized multi-sensor dynamic data related to different maneuvering tasks performed by a human operator. It is shown that different machine learning approaches can be used to first learn single modality models using coupled Dynamic Bayesian Networks; such models are then correlated at event level to discover contextual multi-modal concepts. In the presented case, visual perception and localization are used as modalities. Cross-correlations among modalities in time is discovered from data and are described as probabilistic links connecting shared and private multi-modal DBNs at the event (discrete) level. Results are presented on experiments performed on an autonomous vehicle, highlighting potentiality of the proposed approach to allow anomaly detection and autonomous decision making based on learned self-awareness models.

##### Abstract (translated by Google)
本文提出了一种用于学习自主车辆自我认知模型的新方法。所提出的技术基于与由操作人员执行的不同机动任务有关的同步多传感器动态数据的可用性。结果表明，不同的机器学习方法可用于首先使用耦合动态贝叶斯网络学习单模态模型;然后将这些模型在事件级相关联以发现上下文多模式概念。在所呈现的情况下，视觉感知和本地化被用作模态。时间模式之间的互相关是从数据中发现的，并被描述为在事件（离散）级别连接共享和私有多模式DBN的概率链接。结果展示了在自主车辆上进行的实验，强调了所提出的基于学习的自我意识模型的异常检测和自主决策方法的潜力。
