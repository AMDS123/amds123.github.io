##### Abstract
Program comprehension is a dominant process in software development and maintenance. Experts are considered to comprehend the source code efficiently by directing their gaze, or attention, to important components in it. However, reflecting importance of components is still a remaining issue in gaze behavior analysis for source code comprehension. Here we show a conceptual framework to compare the quantified importance of source code components with gaze behavior of programmers. We use "attention" in attention models (e.g., code2vec) as the importance indices for source code components and evaluate programmers' gaze locations based on the quantified importance. In this report, we introduce the idea of our gaze behavior analysis using the attention map, and the results of a preliminary experiment.
