##### Abstract
Expert human drivers perform actions relying on traffic laws and their previous experience. While traffic laws are easily embedded into an artificial brain, modeling human complex behaviors which come from past experience is a more challenging task. One of these behaviors is the capability of communicating intentions and negotiating the right of way through driving actions, as when a driver is entering a crowded roundabout and observes other cars movements to guess the best time to merge in. In addition, each driver has its own unique driving style, which is conditioned by both its personal characteristics, such as age and quality of sight, and external factors, such as being late or in a bad mood. For these reasons, the interaction between different drivers is not trivial to simulate in a realistic manner. In this paper, this problem is addressed by developing a microscopic simulator using a Deep Reinforcement Learning Algorithm based on a combination of visual frames, representing the perception around the vehicle, and a vector of numerical parameters. In particular, the algorithm called Asynchronous Advantage Actor-Critic has been extended to a multi-agent scenario in which every agent needs to learn to interact with other similar agents. Moreover, the model includes a novel architecture such that the driving style of each vehicle is adjustable by tuning some of its input parameters, permitting to simulate drivers with different levels of aggressiveness and desired cruising speeds.
