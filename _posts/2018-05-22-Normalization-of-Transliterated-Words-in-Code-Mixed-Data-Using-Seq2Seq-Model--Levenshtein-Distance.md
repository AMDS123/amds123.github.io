##### Abstract
Building tools for code-mixed data is rapidly gaining popularity in the NLP research community as such data is exponentially rising on social media. Working with code-mixed data contains several challenges, especially due to grammatical inconsistencies and spelling variations in addition to all the previous known challenges for social media scenarios. In this article, we present a novel architecture focusing on normalizing phonetic typing variations, which is commonly seen in code-mixed data. One of the main features of our architecture is that in addition to normalizing, it can also be utilized for back-transliteration and word identification in some cases. Our model achieved an accuracy of 90.27% on the test data.

编码混合数据的构建工具在NLP研究界迅速普及，因为这些数据在社交媒体上呈指数级增长。使用代码混合数据包含几个挑战，尤其是由于语法不一致和拼写变化以及社交媒体场景的所有以前已知的挑战。在这篇文章中，我们提出了一种新颖的架构，重点是规范化语音类型变化，这在代码混合数据中很常见。我们体系结构的主要特征之一是，除了正常化之外，它还可以在某些情况下用于反音译和单词识别。我们的模型在测试数据上达到了90.27％的准确度。
