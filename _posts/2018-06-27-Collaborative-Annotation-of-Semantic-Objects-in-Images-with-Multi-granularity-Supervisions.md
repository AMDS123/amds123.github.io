##### Abstract
Per-pixel masks of semantic objects are very useful in many applications, which, however, are tedious to be annotated. In this paper, we propose a human-agent collaborative annotation approach that can efficiently generate per-pixel masks of semantic objects in tagged images with multi-granularity supervisions. Given a set of tagged image, a computer agent is first dynamically generated to roughly localize the semantic objects described by the tag. The agent first extracts massive object proposals from an image and then infer the tag-related ones under the weak and strong supervisions from linguistically and visually similar images and previously annotated object masks. By representing such supervisions by over-complete dictionaries, the tag-related object proposals can pop-out according to their sparse coding length, which are then converted to superpixels with binary labels. After that, human annotators participate in the annotation process by flipping labels and dividing superpixels with mouse clicks, which are used as click supervisions that teach the agent to recover false positives/negatives in processing images with the same tags. Experimental results show that our approach can facilitate the annotation process and generate object masks that are highly consistent with those generated by the LabelMe toolbox.

##### Abstract (translated by Google)
语义对象的每像素掩码在许多应用程序中非常有用，然而，这些应用程序很难被注释。在本文中，我们提出了一种人工智能代理协作注释方法，该方法可以在多粒度监控下有效地生成标记图像中的语义对象的每像素蒙版。给定一组标记图像，首先动态生成计算机代理程序以大致定位由标记描述的语义对象。代理人首先从图像中提取大量的对象提议，然后在弱和强烈的监督下从语言和视觉上相似的图像以及之前注释过的对象蒙版推断与标签相关的提议。通过超完整词典表示这些监督，标签相关对象提议可以根据其稀疏编码长度弹出，然后将其转换为具有二进制标签的超像素。之后，人类注释者通过翻转标签并用鼠标单击来划分超级像素来参与注释过程，这些用作点击监视器，用于教导代理人在处理具有相同标签的图像时的误报/否定。实验结果表明，我们的方法可以促进注释过程，并生成与LabelMe工具箱生成的高度一致的对象遮罩。
