##### Abstract
Image analysis methods that are based on exact blur values are faced with the computational complexities due to blur measurement error. This atmosphere encourages scholars to look for handcrafted and learned features for finding depth from a single image. This paper introduces a novel exact realization for blur measures on digital images and implements it on a new measure of defocus Gaussian blur at edge points in Depth From Defocus (DFD) methods with the potential to change this atmosphere. The experiments on real images indicate superiority of the proposed measure in error performance over conventional learned features in the state-of the-art single image based depth estimation methods.

基于精确模糊值的图像分析方法由于模糊测量误差而面临计算复杂性。这种气氛鼓励学者寻找手工制作和学习功能，从单一的图像找到深度。本文介绍了一种新的数字图像模糊测量的精确实现，并实现了深度离焦（DFD）方法边缘点上的散焦高斯模糊的新度量，并具有改变这种气氛的潜力。在实际图像上的实验表明，在现有技术的基于单个图像的深度估计方法中，所提出的测量在误差性能上优于常规学习特征的优势。
