##### Abstract
We present StarSpace, a general-purpose neural embedding model that can solve a wide variety of problems: labeling tasks such as text classification, ranking tasks such as information retrieval/web search, collaborative filtering-based or content-based recommendation, embedding of multi-relational graphs, and learning word, sentence or document level embeddings. In each case the model works by embedding those entities comprised of discrete features and comparing them against each other -- learning similarities dependent on the task. Empirical results on a number of tasks show that StarSpace is highly competitive with existing methods, whilst also being generally applicable to new cases where those methods are not.

我们提出了一个通用的神经嵌入模型StarSpace，它可以解决各种各样的问题：诸如文本分类，信息检索/网络搜索，基于协作过滤或基于内容的推荐，排序任务 - 关系图，学习单词，句子或文档级嵌入。在每种情况下，模型都是通过嵌入由离散特征组成的实体并将它们相互比较来学习 - 学习与任务相关的相似性。一些任务的实证结果表明，StarSpace与现有方法竞争非常激烈，同时也普遍适用于那些方法不适用的新案例。
