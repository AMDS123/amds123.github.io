##### Abstract
We provide code that produces beautiful poetry. Our sonnet-generation algorithm includes several novel elements that improve over the state-of-the-art, leading to rhythmic and inspiring poems. The work discussed here is the winner of the 2018 PoetiX Literary Turing Test Award for computer-generated poetry.
