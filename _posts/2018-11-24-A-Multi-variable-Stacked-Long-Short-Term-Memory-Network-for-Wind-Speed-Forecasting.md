##### Abstract
Precisely forecasting wind speed is essential for wind power producers and grid operators. However, this task is challenging due to the stochasticity of wind speed. To accurately predict short-term wind speed under uncertainties, this paper proposed a multi-variable stacked LSTMs model (MSLSTM). The proposed method utilizes multiple historical meteorological variables, such as wind speed, temperature, humidity, pressure, dew point and solar radiation to accurately predict wind speeds. The prediction performance is extensively assessed using real data collected in West Texas, USA. The experimental results show that the proposed MSLSTM can preferably capture and learn uncertainties while output competitive performance.
