##### Abstract
Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), have intrigued different people from all walks of life, because of their pervasive computing capabilities. UAV equipped with vision techniques, could be leveraged to establish navigation autonomous control for UAV itself. Also, object detection from UAV could be used to broaden the utilization of drone to provide ubiquitous surveillance and monitoring services towards military operation, urban administration and agriculture management. As the data-driven technologies evolved, machine learning algorithm, especially the deep learning approach has been intensively utilized to solve different traditional computer vision research problems. Modern Convolutional Neural Networks based object detectors could be divided into two major categories: one-stage object detector and two-stage object detector. In this study, we utilize some representative CNN based object detectors to execute the computer vision task over Stanford Drone Dataset (SDD). State-of-the-art performance has been achieved in utilizing focal loss dense detector RetinaNet based approach for object detection from UAV in a fast and accurate manner.
