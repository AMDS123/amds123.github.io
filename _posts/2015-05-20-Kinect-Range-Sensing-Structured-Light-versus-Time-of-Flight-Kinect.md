##### Abstract
Recently, the new Kinect One has been issued by Microsoft, providing the next generation of real-time range sensing devices based on the Time-of-Flight (ToF) principle. As the first Kinect version was using a structured light approach, one would expect various differences in the characteristics of the range data delivered by both devices. This paper presents a detailed and in-depth comparison between both devices. In order to conduct the comparison, we propose a framework of seven different experimental setups, which is a generic basis for evaluating range cameras such as Kinect. The experiments have been designed with the goal to capture individual effects of the Kinect devices as isolatedly as possible and in a way, that they can also be adopted, in order to apply them to any other range sensing device. The overall goal of this paper is to provide a solid insight into the pros and cons of either device. Thus, scientists that are interested in using Kinect range sensing cameras in their specific application scenario can directly assess the expected, specific benefits and potential problem of either device.

最近，微软发布了新的Kinect One，提供基于飞行时间（ToF）原理的下一代实时距离传感设备。作为第一个Kinect版本使用的是结构光的方法，人们会期望在两个设备提供的范围数据的特性方面有各种不同。本文提供了两种设备之间的详细和深入的比较。为了进行比较，我们提出了七个不同的实验设置框架，这是一个评估范围相机，如Kinect的通用基础。实验设计的目标是尽可能孤立地捕捉Kinect设备的个别效果，并且也可以采用它们，以便将它们应用于任何其他距离感应设备。本文的总体目标是深入了解这两种设备的优缺点。因此，有兴趣在其特定应用场景中使用Kinect距离感应摄像机的科学家可以直接评估任何一种设备的预期的具体效益和潜在问题。
