##### Abstract
Cyber-physical systems are conducting increasingly complex tasks, which are often modeled using formal languages such as temporal logic. The system's ability to perform the required tasks can be curtailed by malicious adversaries that mount intelligent attacks. At present, however, synthesis in the presence of such attacks has received limited research attention. In particular, the problem of synthesizing a controller when the required specifications cannot be satisfied completely due to adversarial attacks has not been studied. In this paper, we focus on the minimum violation control synthesis problem under linear temporal logic constraints of a stochastic finite state discrete-time system with the presence of an adversary. A minimum violation control strategy is one that satisfies the most important tasks defined by the user while violating the less important ones. We model the interaction between the controller and adversary using a concurrent Stackelberg game and present a nonlinear programming problem to formulate and solve for the optimal control policy. To reduce the computation effort, we develop a heuristic algorithm that solves the problem efficiently and demonstrate our proposed approach using a numerical case study.

网络物理系统正在执行越来越复杂的任务，这些任务通常使用诸如时间逻辑之类的正式语言来建模。执行所需任务的系统可能会受到安装智能攻击的恶意攻击者的限制。然而，目前，在存在这种攻击的情况下的综合受到了有限的研究关注。特别是，尚未研究在由于对抗性攻击而不能完全满足所需规格时合成控制器的问题。在本文中，我们关注具有对手存在的随机有限状态离散时间系统的线性时间逻辑约束下的最小违规控制综合问题。最小违规控制策略是满足用户定义的最重要任务而违反不太重要的任务的策略。我们使用并发Stackelberg游戏模拟控制器和对手之间的交互，并提出非线性规划问题来制定和解决最优控制策略。为了减少计算工作量，我们开发了一种启发式算法，可以有效地解决问题，并使用数值案例研究来演示我们提出的方法。
