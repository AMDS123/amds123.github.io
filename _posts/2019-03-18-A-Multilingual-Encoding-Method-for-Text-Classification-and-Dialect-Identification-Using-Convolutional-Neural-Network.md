##### Abstract
This thesis presents a language-independent text classification model by introduced two new encoding methods "BUNOW" and "BUNOC" used for feeding the raw text data into a new CNN spatial architecture with vertical and horizontal convolutional process instead of commonly used methods like one hot vector or word representation (i.e. word2vec) with temporal CNN architecture. The proposed model can be classified as hybrid word-character model in its work methodology because it consumes less memory space by using a fewer neural network parameters as in character level representation, in addition to providing much faster computations with fewer network layers depth, as in word level representation. A promising result achieved compared to state of art models in two different morphological benchmarked dataset one for Arabic language and one for English language.
