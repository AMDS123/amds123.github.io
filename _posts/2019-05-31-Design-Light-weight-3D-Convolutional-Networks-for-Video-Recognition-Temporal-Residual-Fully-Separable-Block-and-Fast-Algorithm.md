##### Abstract
Deep 3-dimensional (3D) Convolutional Network (ConvNet) has shown promising performance on video recognition tasks because of its powerful spatio-temporal information fusion ability. However, the extremely intensive requirements on memory access and computing power prohibit it from being used in resource-constrained scenarios, such as portable and edge devices. So in this paper, we first propose a two-stage Fully Separable Block (FSB) to significantly compress the model sizes of 3D ConvNets. Then a feature enhancement approach named Temporal Residual Gradient (TRG) is developed to improve the performance of compressed model on video tasks, which provides higher accuracy, faster convergency and better robustness. Moreover, in order to further decrease the computing workload, we propose a hybrid Fast Algorithm (hFA) to drastically reduce the computation complexity of convolutions. These methods are effectively combined to design a light-weight and efficient ConvNet for video recognition tasks. Experiments on the popular dataset report 2.3x compression rate, 3.6x workload reduction, and 6.3% top-1 accuracy gain, over the state-of-the-art SlowFast model, which is already a highly compact model. The proposed methods also show good adaptability on traditional 3D ConvNet, demonstrating 7.4x more compact model, 11.0x less workload, and 3.0% higher accuracy
