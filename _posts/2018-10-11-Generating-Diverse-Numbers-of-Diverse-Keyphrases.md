##### Abstract
Existing keyphrase generation studies suffer from the problems of generating duplicate phrases and deficient evaluation based on a fixed number of predicted phrases. We propose a recurrent generative model that generates multiple keyphrases sequentially from a text, with specific modules that promote generation diversity. We further propose two new metrics that consider a variable number of phrases. With both existing and proposed evaluation setups, our model demonstrates superior performance to baselines on three types of keyphrase generation datasets, including two newly introduced in this work: StackExchange and TextWorld ACG. In contrast to previous keyphrase generation approaches, our model generates sets of diverse keyphrases of a variable number.
