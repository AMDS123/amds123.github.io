##### Abstract
Several characteristics of written texts have been inferred from statistical analysis derived from networked models. Even though many network measurements have been adapted to study textual properties at several levels of complexity, some textual aspects have been disregarded. In this paper, we study the symmetry of word adjacency networks, a well-known representation of text as a graph. A statistical analysis of the symmetry distribution performed in several novels showed that most of the words do not display symmetric patterns of connectivity. More specifically, the merged symmetry displayed a distribution similar to the ubiquitous power-law distribution. Our experiments also revealed that the studied metrics do not correlate with other traditional network measurements, such as the degree or betweenness centrality. The effectiveness of the symmetry measurements was verified in the authorship attribution task. Interestingly, we found that specific authors prefer particular types of symmetric motifs. As a consequence, the authorship of books could be accurately identified in 82.5% of the cases, in a dataset comprising books written by 8 authors. Because the proposed measurements for text analysis are complementary to the traditional approach, they can be used to improve the characterization of text networks, which might be useful for related applications, such as those relying on the identification of topical words and information retrieval.

从网络模型得出的统计分析推断了书面文本的几个特点。尽管许多网络测量已经适应了在几个复杂程度上研究文本属性，但是一些文本方面却被忽略了。在本文中，我们研究字邻接网络的对称性，这是一个众所周知的文本表示形式。对几种小说中对称分布的统计分析表明，大部分词汇并不显示连通性的对称模式。更具体地说，合并对称表现出类似于无处不在的幂律分布的分布。我们的实验还显示，所研究的指标与其他传统网络测量（例如程度或中介性中心性）不相关。对称性测量的有效性在作者归属任务中得到验证。有趣的是，我们发现特定的作者喜欢特定类型的对称图案。因此，在由8位作者撰写的书籍的数据集中，82.5％的案例可以准确识别出书籍的作者。由于所提出的文本分析测量方法是对传统方法的补充，因此可以用来改进文本网络的特征描述，这对于相关应用（例如依赖于主题词和信息检索的识别）可能是有用的。
