##### Abstract
Identification of causal effects is one of the most fundamental tasks of causal inference. We study a variant of the identifiability problem where the experimental distribution of interest is partially known. This corresponds to a real-world setting where experiments were conducted on a set of variables, which we call surrogate outcomes, but the variables of interest were not 10 measured. We label this problem as surrogate outcome identifiability and show that the concept of transportability provides a sufficient criteria for determining surrogate outcome identifiability for a large class of problems.

因果效应的识别是因果推断的最基本的任务之一。我们研究可识别性问题的变体，其中感兴趣的实验分布部分已知。这与现实世界的设置相对应，其中对一组变量进行实验，我们称之为替代结果，但未测量感兴趣的变量。我们将这个问题标记为替代结果可识别性，并且表明可运输性的概念为确定大量问题的替代结果可识别性提供了足够的标准。
