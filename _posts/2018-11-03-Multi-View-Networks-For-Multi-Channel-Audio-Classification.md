##### Abstract
In this paper we introduce the idea of multi-view networks for sound classification with multiple sensors. We show how one can build a multi-channel sound recognition model trained on a fixed number of channels, and deploy it to scenarios with arbitrary (and potentially dynamically changing) number of input channels and not observe degradation in performance. We demonstrate that at inference time you can safely provide this model all available channels as it can ignore noisy information and leverage new information better than standard baseline approaches. The model is evaluated in both an anechoic environment and in rooms generated by a room acoustics simulator. We demonstrate that this model can generalize to unseen numbers of channels as well as unseen room geometries.
