##### Abstract
Generative adversarial networks (GANs) are able to model the complex highdimensional distributions of real-world data, which suggests they could be effective for anomaly detection. However, few works have explored the use of GANs for the anomaly detection task. We leverage recently developed GAN models for anomaly detection, and achieve state-of-the-art performance on image and network intrusion datasets, while being several hundred-fold faster at test time than the only published GAN-based method.
