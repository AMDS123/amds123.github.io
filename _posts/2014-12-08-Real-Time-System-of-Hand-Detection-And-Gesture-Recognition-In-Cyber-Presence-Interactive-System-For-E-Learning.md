##### Abstract
The development of technologies of multimedia, linked to that of Internet and democratization of high outflow, has made henceforth E-learning possible for learners being in virtual classes and geographically distributed. The quality and quantity of asynchronous and synchronous communications are the key elements for E-learning success. It is important to have a propitious supervision to reduce the feeling of isolation in E-learning. This feeling of isolation is among the main causes of loss and high rates of stalling in E-learning. The researches to be conducted in this domain aim to bring solutions of convergence coming from real time image for the capture and recognition of hand gestures. These gestures will be analyzed by the system and transformed as indicator of participation. This latter is displayed in the table of performance of the tutor as a curve according to the time. In case of isolation of learner, the indicator of participation will become red and the tutor will be informed of learners with difficulties to participate during learning session.

多媒体技术的发展与互联网技术的发展和高流量的民主化相结合，使以后的在线学习成为虚拟课堂和地理分布的学习者的可能。异步和同步通信的质量和数量是电子学习成功的关键因素。有一个有利的监督，以减少电子学习孤立的感觉是重要的。这种孤立感是网络学习失败的主要原因之一，也是导致失败的主要原因之一。在这个领域进行的研究旨在为手势的捕获和识别带来来自实时图像的融合解决方案。这些手势将被系统分析，并转化为参与的指标。后者根据时间显示在导师表现曲线中。在学习者孤立的情况下，参与指标将变为红色，在学习期间通知导师难以参与的学习者。
