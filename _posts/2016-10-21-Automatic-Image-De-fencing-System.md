##### Abstract
Tourists and Wild-life photographers are often hindered in capturing their cherished images or videos by a fence that limits accessibility to the scene of interest. The situation has been exacerbated by growing concerns of security at public places and a need exists to provide a tool that can be used for post-processing such fenced videos to produce a de-fenced image. There are several challenges in this problem, we identify them as Robust detection of fence/occlusions and Estimating pixel motion of background scenes and Filling in the fence/occlusions by utilizing information in multiple frames of the input video. In this work, we aim to build an automatic post-processing tool that can efficiently rid the input video of occlusion artifacts like fences. Our work is distinguished by two major contributions. The first is the introduction of learning based technique to detect the fences patterns with complicated backgrounds. The second is the formulation of objective function and further minimization through loopy belief propagation to fill-in the fence pixels. We observe that grids of Histogram of oriented gradients descriptor using Support vector machines based classifier significantly outperforms detection accuracy of texels in a lattice. We present results of experiments using several real-world videos to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed fence detection and de-fencing algorithm.

游客和野生生物摄影师经常被阻碍捕捉他们珍爱的图像或视频的栅栏，限制了对感兴趣场景的访问。随着公共场所安全问题的日益严重，情况更加恶化，需要提供一种工具，可以用来对这些围栏视频进行后期处理，从而形成一道防线。在这个问题上有几个挑战，我们将它们识别为鲁棒的栅栏/遮挡检测和估计背景场景的像素运动，并利用输入视频的多个帧中的信息来填充栅栏/遮挡。在这项工作中，我们的目标是建立一个自动后期处理工具，可以有效地清除输入视频的遮挡文物，如栅栏。我们的工作有两个主要贡献。首先是引入基于学习的技术来检测具有复杂背景的栅栏图案。其次是目标函数的表达，通过Loopy置信传播进一步最小化填充栅栏像素。我们观察到使用基于支持向量机的分类器的定向梯度描述符的直方图的网格明显优于格子中的纹理元素的检测精度。我们使用几个真实世界的视频展示实验的结果，以展示所提出的栅栏检测和隔离算法的有效性。
