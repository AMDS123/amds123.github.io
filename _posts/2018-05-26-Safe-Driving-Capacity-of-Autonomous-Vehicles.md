##### Abstract
An excellent self-driving car is expected to take its passengers safely and efficiently from one place to another. However, different ways of defining safety and efficiency may significantly affect the conclusion we make. In this paper, we give formal definitions to the safe state of a road and safe state of a vehicle using the syntax of linear temporal logic (LTL). We then propose the concept of safe driving throughput (SDT) and safe driving capacity (SDC) which measure the amount of vehicles in the safe state on a road. We analyze how SDT is affected by different factors. We show the analytic difference of SDC between the road with perception-based vehicles (PBV) and the road with cooperative-based vehicles (CBV). We claim that through proper design, the SDC of the road filled with PBVs will be upper-bounded by the SDC of the road filled with CBVs.

预计一辆出色的自动驾驶汽车将安全有效地从一个地方带到另一个地方。然而，定义安全性和效率的不同方式可能会显着影响我们所做的结论。在本文中，我们使用线性时序逻辑（LTL）的语法给出了道路安全状态和车辆安全状态的正式定义。然后，我们提出了安全驾驶吞吐量（SDT）和安全驾驶能力（SDC）的概念，用于测量道路上安全状态下的车辆数量。我们分析了SDT如何受到不同因素的影响。我们展示了基于感知的车辆（PBV）与合作型车辆（CBV）的道路之间SDC的分析差异。我们声称，通过适当的设计，填充PBV的道路的SDC将由填充CBV的道路的SDC上界。
