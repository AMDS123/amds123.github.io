##### Abstract
Visual media has always been the most enjoyed way of communication. From the advent of television to the modern day hand held computers, we have witnessed the exponential growth of images around us. Undoubtedly it's a fact that they carry a lot of information in them which needs be utilized in an effective manner. Hence intense need has been felt to efficiently index and store large image collections for effective and on- demand retrieval. For this purpose low-level features extracted from the image contents like color, texture and shape has been used. Content based image retrieval systems employing these features has proven very successful. Image retrieval has promising applications in numerous fields and hence has motivated researchers all over the world. New and improved ways to represent visual content are being developed each day. Tremendous amount of research has been carried out in the last decade. In this paper we will present a detailed overview of some of the powerful color, texture and shape descriptors for content based image retrieval. A comparative analysis will also be carried out for providing an insight into outstanding challenges in this field.

视觉媒体一直是最受欢迎的交流方式。从电视的出现到现代手持电脑的出现，我们目睹了我们周围影像的指数级增长。毫无疑问，他们在信息中载入了大量有用的信息。因此，迫切需要有效地索引和存储大型图像集合以进行有效和按需检索。为此，已经使用了从图像内容中提取的低级特征，如颜色，纹理和形状。基于内容的图像检索系统采用这些功能已被证明非常成功。图像检索在众多领域有着广阔的应用前景，因此激励了全世界的研究人员。每天都在开发新的和改进的表示视觉内容的方法。在过去的十年中进行了大量的研究。在本文中，我们将详细介绍基于内容的图像检索的一些强大的颜色，纹理和形状描述符。还将进行比较分析，以深入了解这一领域的突出挑战。
