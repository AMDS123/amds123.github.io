##### Abstract
While deep learning has pushed the boundaries in various machine learning tasks, the current models are still far away from replicating many functions that a normal human brain can do. Explicit memorization based deep architecture have been recently proposed with the objective to understand and predict better. In this work, we design a system that involves a primary learner and an adjacent representational memory bank which is organized using a comparative learner. This spatially forked deep architecture with a structured memory can simultaneously predict and reason about the nature of an input, which may even belong to a category never seen in the training data, by relating it with the memorized past representations at the higher layers. Characterizing images of unseen object classes in both synthetic and real world datasets is used as an example to showcase the operational success of the proposed framework.

虽然深度学习已经在各种机器学习任务中推进了界限，但是目前的模型仍然远不能复制正常人类大脑可以完成的许多功能。最近提出了基于显式记忆的深层架构，目的是更好地理解和预测。在这项工作中，我们设计了一个系统，涉及一个初级学习者和一个相邻的代表性记忆库，这个记忆库是由一个比较学习者组织的。这种具有结构化记忆的空间分叉式深层架构可以同时预测和推理输入的性质，该输入甚至可以属于训练数据中从未见过的类别，通过将其与在较高层处记忆的过去表示相关联。在合成和现实世界数据集中表征看不见的对象类的图像被用作示例以展示所提出的框架的操作成功。
