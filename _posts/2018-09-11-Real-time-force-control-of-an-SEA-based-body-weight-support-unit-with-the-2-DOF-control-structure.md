##### Abstract
Body weight support (BWS) is a fundamental technique in rehabilitation. Along with the dramatic progressing of rehabilitation science and engineering, BWS is quickly evolving with new initiatives and has attracted deep research effort in recent years. We have built up a novel gravity offloading system, in which the patient is allowed to move freely in the three-dimensional Cartesian space and receives support against gravity. Thus, the patients, especially for those that suffer from neurological injury such as stroke or spinal cord injury, can focus their residual motor control capabilities on essential therapeutic trainings of balance and gait. The real-time force control performance is critical for the BWS unit to provide suitable support and avoid disturbance. In this work, we have re-designed our BWS unit with a series elastic actuation structure to improve the human-robot interaction performance. Further, the 2 degrees of freedom (2-DOF) control approach was taken for accurate and robust BWS force control. Both simulation and experimental results have validated the efficacy of the BWS design and real-time control methods.

体重支持（BWS）是康复的基本技术。随着康复科学和工程学的迅速发展，BWS正在迅速发展，并且近年来吸引了深入的研究工作。我们建立了一种新型的重力卸载系统，允许患者在三维笛卡尔空间内自由移动并获得重力支撑。因此，患者，尤其是那些患有中风或脊髓损伤等神经损伤的患者，可以将其残余运动控制能力集中在平衡和步态的基本治疗训练上。实时力控制性能对于BWS装置提供合适的支撑和避免干扰至关重要。在这项工作中，我们重新设计了具有一系列弹性驱动结构的BWS装置，以改善人机交互性能。此外，采用2自由度（2-DOF）控制方法来实现准确且稳健的BWS力控制。仿真和实验结果均验证了BWS设计和实时控制方法的有效性。
