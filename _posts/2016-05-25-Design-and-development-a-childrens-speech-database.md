##### Abstract
The report presents the process of planning, designing and the development of a database of spoken children's speech whose native language is Bulgarian. The proposed model is designed for children between the age of 4 and 6 without speech disorders, and reflects their specific capabilities. At this age most children cannot read, there is no sustained concentration, they are emotional, etc. The aim is to unite all the media information accompanying the recording and processing of spoken speech, thereby to facilitate the work of researchers in the field of speech recognition. This database will be used for the development of systems for children's speech recognition, children's speech synthesis systems, games which allow voice control, etc. As a result of the proposed model a prototype system for speech recognition is presented.

报告介绍了以母语保加利亚语为母语的儿童言语数据库的规划，设计和发展过程。该模型是针对4-6岁之间没有语言障碍的儿童而设计的，反映了他们的具体能力。在这个年龄段，大多数孩子看不懂，没有持续的注意力，情绪激动等等，目的是统一所有媒体信息伴随口语的记录和处理，从而促进话语领域研究人员的工作承认。该数据库将用于儿童语音识别系统的开发，儿童语音合成系统，允许语音控制的游戏等。作为所提出的模型的结果，提出了用于语音识别的原型系统。
