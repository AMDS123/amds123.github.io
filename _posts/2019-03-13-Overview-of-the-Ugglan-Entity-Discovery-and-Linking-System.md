##### Abstract
Ugglan is a system designed to discover named entities and link them to unique identifiers in a knowledge base. It is based on a combination of a name and nominal dictionary derived from Wikipedia and Wikidata, a named entity recognition module (NER) using fixed ordinally-forgetting encoding (FOFE) trained on the TAC EDL data from 2014-2016, a candidate generation module from the Wikipedia link graph across multiple editions, a PageRank link and cooccurrence graph disambiguator, and finally a reranker trained on the TAC EDL 2015-2016 data.
