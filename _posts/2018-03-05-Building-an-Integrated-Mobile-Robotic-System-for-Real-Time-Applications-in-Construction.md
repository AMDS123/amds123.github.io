##### Abstract
One of the major challenges of a real-time autonomous robotic system for construction monitoring is to simultaneously localize, map, and navigate over the lifetime of the robot, with little or no human intervention. Past research on Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) and context-awareness are two active research areas in the computer vision and robotics communities. The studies that integrate both in real-time into a single modular framework for construction monitoring still need further investigation. A monocular vision system and real-time scene understanding are computationally heavy and the major state-of-the-art algorithms are tested on high-end desktops and/or servers with a high CPU- and/or GPU- computing capabilities, which affect their mobility and deployment for real-world applications. To address these challenges and achieve automation, this paper proposes an integrated robotic computer vision system, which generates a real-world spatial map of the obstacles and traversable space present in the environment in near real-time. This is done by integrating contextual Awareness and visual SLAM into a ground robotics agent. This paper presents the hardware utilization and performance of the aforementioned system for three different outdoor environments, which represent the applicability of this pipeline to diverse outdoor scenes in near real-time. The entire system is also self-contained and does not require user input, which demonstrates the potential of this computer vision system for autonomous navigation.

实时自动机器人系统在施工监控中面临的主要挑战之一是在机器人的整个使用寿命期间同时进行本地化，映射和导航，很少或根本没有人为干预。过去的同时定位和制图（SLAM）和情境意识研究是计算机视觉和机器人领域的两个活跃研究领域。实时整合到单个模块化施工监控框架中的研究仍需进一步研究。单眼视觉系统和实时场景理解的计算量很大，主要的最新算法在具有高CPU和/或GPU计算能力的高端台式机和/或服务器上进行测试，这会影响其实际应用的移动性和部署。为了应对这些挑战并实现自动化，本文提出了一种集成式机器人计算机视觉系统，该系统可近乎实时地生成环境中存在的障碍物和可穿越空间的真实空间图。这是通过将情景感知和视觉SLAM集成到地面机器人代理中完成的。本文介绍了上述系统在三种不同户外环境下的硬件利用率和性能，这些代表了该管道对近实时多种户外场景的适用性。整个系统也是独立的，不需要用户输入，这表明这种计算机视觉系统具有自动导航的潜力。
