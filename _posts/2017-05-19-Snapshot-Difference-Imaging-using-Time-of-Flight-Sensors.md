##### Abstract
Computational photography encompasses a diversity of imaging techniques, but one of the core operations performed by many of them is to compute image differences. An intuitive approach to computing such differences is to capture several images sequentially and then process them jointly. Usually, this approach leads to artifacts when recording dynamic scenes. In this paper, we introduce a snapshot difference imaging approach that is directly implemented in the sensor hardware of emerging time-of-flight cameras. With a variety of examples, we demonstrate that the proposed snapshot difference imaging technique is useful for direct-global illumination separation, for direct imaging of spatial and temporal image gradients, for direct depth edge imaging, and more.

计算摄影包含多种成像技术，但其中许多核心操作之一是计算图像差异。计算这种差异的直观方法是依次捕获多个图像，然后共同处理它们。通常，这种方法在录制动态场景时会导致伪影。在本文中，我们介绍一种快照差分成像方法，直接在新兴的飞行时间相机的传感器硬件中实现。通过各种实例，我们证明了所提出的快照差异成像技术对于直接全局照明分离，直接成像空间和时间图像梯度以及直接深度边缘成像等是有用的。
