##### Abstract
We present an electro-optic modulator design concept based on a High Electron Mobility Transistor (HEMT) architecture. The device utilizes the plasma dispersion effect of the highly localized 2D electron gas (2DEG) at the III-V heterojunction as the modulation mechanism. The proposed modulator benefits from the large mobility of the 2DEG carriers that enables ultrahigh speed switching of the carrier density for electro-optic modulation. We derive an analytical model and perform supporting technology computer-aided design (TCAD) simulations using Silvaco ATLAS to quantify the plasma dispersion effect and modulation efficiency due to the 2DEG, and present a feasible parameter space for designing an AlGaN/GaN free-space optical modulator operating at telecommunication wavelength (1.55um) for high speed on-chip optical interconnects.
