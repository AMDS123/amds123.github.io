##### Abstract
In this paper, we use reinforcement learning to find effective decoding strategies for binary linear codes. We start by reviewing several iterative decoding algorithms that involve a decision-making process at each step, including bit-flipping (BF) decoding, residual belief propagation, and anchor decoding. We then illustrate how such algorithms can be mapped to Markov decision processes allowing for data-driven learning of optimal decision strategies, rather than basing decisions on heuristics or intuition. As a case study, we consider BF decoding for both the binary symmetric and additive white Gaussian noise channel. Our results show that learned BF decoders can offer a range of performance-complexity trade-offs for the considered Reed-Muller and BCH codes, and achieve near-optimal performance in some cases. We also demonstrate learning convergence speed-ups when biasing the learning process towards correct decoding decisions, as opposed to relying only on random explorations and past knowledge.
