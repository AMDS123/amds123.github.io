##### Abstract
Objective: Surgical data science is evolving into a research field that aims to observe everything occurring within and around the treatment process to provide situation-aware data-driven assistance. In the context of endoscopic video analysis, the accurate classification of organs in the field of view of the camera proffers a technical challenge. Herein, we propose a new approach to anatomical structure classification and image tagging that features an intrinsic measure of confidence to estimate its own performance with high reliability and which can be applied to both RGB and multispectral imaging (MI) data. Methods: Organ recognition is performed using a superpixel classification strategy based on textural and reflectance information. Classification confidence is estimated by analyzing the dispersion of class probabilities. Assessment of the proposed technology is performed through a comprehensive in vivo study with seven pigs. Results: When applied to image tagging, mean accuracy in our experiments increased from 65% (RGB) and 80% (MI) to 90% (RGB) and 96% (MI) with the confidence measure. Conclusion: Results showed that the confidence measure had a significant influence on the classification accuracy, and MI data are better suited for anatomical structure labeling than RGB data. Significance: This work significantly enhances the state of art in automatic labeling of endoscopic videos by introducing the use of the confidence metric, and by being the first study to use MI data for in vivo laparoscopic tissue classification. The data of our experiments will be released as the first in vivo MI dataset upon publication of this paper.

目标：外科数据科学正在发展成一个研究领域，旨在观察治疗过程中和周围发生的所有事情，以提供情境感知数据驱动的帮助。在内窥镜视频分析的背景下，照相机视野中器官的准确分类提出了技术挑战。在此，我们提出了解剖结构分类和图像标记的新方法，其具有以高可靠性估计其自身性能的可靠内在度量，并且可以应用于RGB和多光谱成像（MI）数据。方法：使用基于纹理和反射信息的超像素分类策略进行器官识别。分类置信度是通过分析类别概率的分散来估计的。拟议技术的评估是通过七头猪的全面体内研究进行的。结果：应用于图像标注时，我们实验的平均准确度从置信度度量的65％（RGB）和80％（MI）增加到90％（RGB）和96％（MI）。结论：结果表明，置信度测量对分类精度有显着影响，MI数据比RGB数据更适合解剖结构标记。意义：这项工作通过引入使用置信度度量以及首次使用MI数据进行体内腹腔镜组织分类的研究，显着增强了内窥镜视频自动标记的艺术水平。我们的实验数据将作为本文发表的第一个体内MI数据集发布。
