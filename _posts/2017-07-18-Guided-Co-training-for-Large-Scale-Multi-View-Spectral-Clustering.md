##### Abstract
In many real-world applications, we have access to multiple views of the data, each of which characterizes the data from a distinct aspect. Several previous algorithms have demonstrated that one can achieve better clustering accuracy by integrating information from all views appropriately than using only an individual view. Owing to the effectiveness of spectral clustering, many multi-view clustering methods are based on it. Unfortunately, they have limited applicability to large-scale data due to the high computational complexity of spectral clustering. In this work, we propose a novel multi-view spectral clustering method for large-scale data. Our approach is structured under the guided co-training scheme to fuse distinct views, and uses the sampling technique to accelerate spectral clustering. More specifically, we first select $p$ ($\ll n$) landmark points and then approximate the eigen-decomposition accordingly. The augmented view, which is essential to guided co-training process, can then be quickly determined by our method. The proposed algorithm scales linearly with the number of given data. Extensive experiments have been performed and the results support the advantage of our method for handling the large-scale multi-view situation.

在许多现实世界的应用程序中，我们可以访问数据的多个视图，每个视图都从不同方面表征数据。先前的几种算法已经证明，通过适当地整合来自所有视图的信息，可以比只使用单个视图更好地实现聚类准确性。由于谱聚类的有效性，在此基础上提出了许多多视点聚类方法。不幸的是，由于谱聚类的高计算复杂性，对大规模数据的适用性有限。在这项工作中，我们提出了一种新的大规模数据的多视图谱聚类方法。我们的方法是在指导性的共同训练方案下融合不同的视图，并使用采样技术来加速谱聚类。更具体地说，我们首先选择$ p $（$ \ ll n $）地标点，然后相应地近似特征分解。然后可以通过我们的方法快速确定增强视图，这对于指导协同训练过程是必不可少的。所提出的算法与给定数据的数量成线性关系。已经进行了大量的实验，结果支持了我们的方法处理大规模多视点情况的优势。
