##### Abstract
Accurate segmenting nuclei instances is a crucial step in computer-aided image analysis to extract rich features for cellular estimation and following diagnosis as well as treatment. While it still remains challenging because the wide existence of nuclei clusters, along with the large morphological variances among different organs make nuclei instance segmentation susceptible to over-/under-segmentation. Additionally, the inevitably subjective annotating and mislabeling prevent the network learning from reliable samples and eventually reduce the generalization capability for robustly segmenting unseen organ nuclei. To address these issues, we propose a novel deep neural network, namely Contour-aware Informative Aggregation Network (CIA-Net) with multi-level information aggregation module between two task-specific decoders. Rather than independent decoders, it leverages the merit of spatial and texture dependencies between nuclei and contour by bi-directionally aggregating task-specific features. Furthermore, we proposed a novel smooth truncated loss that modulates losses to reduce the perturbation from outliers. Consequently, the network can focus on learning from reliable and informative samples, which inherently improves the generalization capability. Experiments on the 2018 MICCAI challenge of Multi-Organ-Nuclei-Segmentation validated the effectiveness of our proposed method, surpassing all the other 35 competitive teams by a significant margin.
