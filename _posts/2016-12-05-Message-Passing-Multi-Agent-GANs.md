##### Abstract
Communicating and sharing intelligence among agents is an important facet of achieving Artificial General Intelligence. As a first step towards this challenge, we introduce a novel framework for image generation: Message Passing Multi-Agent Generative Adversarial Networks (MPM GANs). While GANs have recently been shown to be very effective for image generation and other tasks, these networks have been limited to mostly single generator-discriminator networks. We show that we can obtain multi-agent GANs that communicate through message passing to achieve better image generation. The objectives of the individual agents in this framework are two fold: a co-operation objective and a competing objective. The co-operation objective ensures that the message sharing mechanism guides the other generator to generate better than itself while the competing objective encourages each generator to generate better than its counterpart. We analyze and visualize the messages that these GANs share among themselves in various scenarios. We quantitatively show that the message sharing formulation serves as a regularizer for the adversarial training. Qualitatively, we show that the different generators capture different traits of the underlying data distribution.
