##### Abstract
Existing theoretical universal algorithmic intelligence models are not practically realizable. More pragmatic approach to artificial general intelligence is based on cognitive architectures, which are, however, non-universal in sense that they can construct and use models of the environment only from Turing-incomplete model spaces. We believe that the way to the real AGI consists in bridging the gap between these two approaches. This is possible if one considers cognitive functions as a "cognitive bias" (priors and search heuristics) that should be incorporated into the models of universal algorithmic intelligence without violating their universality. Earlier reported results suiting this approach and its overall feasibility are discussed on the example of perception, planning, knowledge representation, attention, theory of mind, language, and some others.
