##### Abstract
We develop a Computer Aided Diagnosis (CAD) system, which enhances the performance of dentists in detecting wide range of dental caries. The CAD System achieves this by acting as a second opinion for the dentists with way higher sensitivity on the task of detecting cavities than the dentists themselves. We develop annotated dataset of more than 3000 bitewing radiographs and utilize it for developing a system for automated diagnosis of dental caries. Our system consists of a deep fully convolutional neural network (FCNN) consisting 100+ layers, which is trained to mark caries on bitewing radiographs. We have compared the performance of our proposed system with three certified dentists for marking dental caries. We exceed the average performance of the dentists in both recall (sensitivity) and F1-Score (agreement with truth) by a very large margin. Working example of our system is shown in Figure 1.

我们开发了计算机辅助诊断（CAD）系统，该系统提高了牙医检测广泛龋齿的性能。 CAD系统通过作为牙科医生的第二个意见来实现这一点，对于检测牙洞的任务比牙科医生本身具有更高的灵敏度。我们开发了超过3000张咬合片的注释数据集，并将其用于开发龋齿自动诊断系统。我们的系统由深度完全卷积神经网络（FCNN）组成，这些网络包括100多层，经过训练可以在咬合翼片上标记龋齿。我们已将所建议的系统与三名注册龋齿的牙医的表现进行比较。在召回（敏感度）和F1分数（与真相一致）方面，我们超过了牙医的平均表现。我们系统的工作示例如图1所示。
