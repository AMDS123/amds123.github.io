##### Abstract
This paper focuses on the challenging problem of 3D pose estimation of a diverse spectrum of articulated objects from single depth images. A novel structured prediction approach is considered, where 3D poses are represented as skeletal models that naturally operate on manifolds. Given an input depth image, the problem of predicting the most proper articulation of underlying skeletal model is thus formulated as sequentially searching for the optimal skeletal configuration. This is subsequently addressed by convolutional neural nets trained end-to-end to render sequential prediction of the joint locations as regressing a set of tangent vectors of the underlying manifolds. Our approach is examined on various articulated objects including human hand, mouse, and fish benchmark datasets. Empirically it is shown to deliver highly competitive performance with respect to the state-of-the-arts, while operating in real-time (over 30 FPS).

本文侧重于从单个深度图像的多种关节物体的3D姿态估计的挑战性问题。考虑一种新颖的结构化预测方法，其中3D姿态被表示为在流形上自然运行的骨架模型。给定输入深度图像，因此预测底层骨架模型的最适当表达的问题被表述为顺序搜索最佳骨架配置。随后，通过卷积神经网络端对端地训练来呈现关节位置的连续预测，作为回归底层流形的一组切向矢量。我们的方法在包括人类手，鼠标和鱼基准数据集在内的各种连接对象上进行检查。实践证明，在实时运行（超过30 FPS）的情况下，可以提供与现有技术水平相当的竞争力。
