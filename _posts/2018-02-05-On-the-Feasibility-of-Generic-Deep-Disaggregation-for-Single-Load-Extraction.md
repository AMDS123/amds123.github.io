##### Abstract
Recently, and with the growing development of big energy datasets, data-driven learning techniques began to represent a potential solution to the energy disaggregation problem outperforming engineered and hand-crafted models. However, most proposed deep disaggregation models are load-dependent in the sense that either expert knowledge or a hyper-parameter optimization stage is required prior to training and deployment (normally for each load category) even upon acquisition and cleansing of aggregate and sub-metered data. In this paper, we present a feasibility study on the development of a generic disaggregation model based on data-driven learning. Specifically, we present a generic deep disaggregation model capable of achieving state-of-art performance in load monitoring for a variety of load categories. The developed model is evaluated on the publicly available UK-DALE dataset with a moderately low sampling frequency and various domestic loads.

最近，随着大型能源数据集的不断发展，数据驱动型学习技术开始成为能源分解问题的潜在解决方案，其性能优于工程和手工模型。然而，大多数提出的深度分解模型是依赖于负载的，即在训练和部署之前需要专家知识或超参数优化阶段（通常对于每个负载类别），甚至在获取和清理总计和子计量数据。在本文中，我们提出了一个基于数据驱动学习的通用分解模型的可行性研究。具体来说，我们提出了一个通用的深度分解模型，能够在各种负荷类别的负荷监测中实现最先进的性能。所开发的模型在公开可用的UK-DALE数据集上进行评估，具有适度低的采样频率和各种家用负载。
