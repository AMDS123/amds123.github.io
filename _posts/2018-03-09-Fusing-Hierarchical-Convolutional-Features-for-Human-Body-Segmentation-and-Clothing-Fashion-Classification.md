##### Abstract
The clothing fashion reflects the common aesthetics that people share with each other in dressing. To recognize the fashion time of a clothing is meaningful for both an individual and the industry. In this paper, under the assumption that the clothing fashion changes year by year, the fashion-time recognition problem is mapped into a clothing-fashion classification problem. Specifically, a novel deep neural network is proposed which achieves accurate human body segmentation by fusing multi-scale convolutional features in a fully convolutional network, and then feature learning and fashion classification are performed on the segmented parts avoiding the influence of image background. In the experiments, 9,339 fashion images from 8 continuous years are collected for performance evaluation. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed body segmentation and fashion classification methods.

服装时尚反映了人们在穿衣中共同分享的共同美学。承认服装的时尚时间对个人和行业都是有意义的。在本文中，假设服装时尚逐年变化，时尚时间识别问题被映射为服装时尚分类问题。具体而言，提出了一种新的深度神经网络，通过在全卷积网络中融合多尺度卷积特征，实现精确的人体分割，然后对分割出的部分进行特征学习和时尚分类，避免了图像背景的影响。在实验中，收集了来自连续8年的9,339张时尚照片，用于性能评估。结果证明了所提出的身体分割和时尚分类方法的有效性。
