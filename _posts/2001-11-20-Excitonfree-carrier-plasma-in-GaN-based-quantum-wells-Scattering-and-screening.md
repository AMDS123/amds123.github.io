##### Abstract
The degree of ionisation of a two-dimensional electron-hole plasma is calculated in the low-density (Boltzmann) limit. The electron-hole interaction is considered for all states: optically active and inactive, bound and unbound. The theory is applied to exciton/free-carrier plasma in GaN-based quantum wells at room temperature.
