##### Abstract
Speckle artifacts degrade image quality in virtually all modalities that utilize coherent energy, including optical coherence tomography, reflectance confocal microscopy, and ultrasound. We present a deep learning framework for laser speckle reduction, DeepLSR (https://durr.jhu.edu/DeepLSR), that transforms coherently-illuminated images to a speckle-free domain. We apply this method to widefield images of objects and tissues illuminated with a multi-wavelength laser, reconstructing speckle-reduced images with greater fidelity than conventional methods.
