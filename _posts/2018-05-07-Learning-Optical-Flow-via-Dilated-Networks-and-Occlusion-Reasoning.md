##### Abstract
Despite the significant progress that has been made on estimating optical flow recently, most estimation methods, including classical and deep learning approaches, still have difficulty with multi-scale estimation, real-time computation, and/or occlusion reasoning. In this paper, we introduce dilated convolution and occlusion reasoning into unsupervised optical flow estimation to address these issues. The dilated convolution allows our network to avoid upsampling via deconvolution and the resulting gridding artifacts. Dilated convolution also results in a smaller memory footprint which speeds up interference. The occlusion reasoning prevents our network from learning incorrect deformations due to occluded image regions during training. Our proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art unsupervised approaches on the KITTI benchmark. We also demonstrate its generalization capability by applying it to action recognition in video.

尽管近来在估计光流方面取得了重大进展，但大多数估计方法（包括经典和深度学习方法）在多尺度估计，实时计算和/或遮挡推理方面仍然存在困难。在本文中，我们将扩张卷积和遮挡推理引入到无监督光流估计中以解决这些问题。扩张的卷积使得我们的网络可以避免通过反卷积和产生的网格伪像进行上采样。扩张卷积还会导致更小的内存占用，从而加速干扰。遮挡推理会阻止我们的网络在训练过程中学习由于遮挡图像区域导致的不正确变形。我们提出的方法胜过KITTI基准测试中最先进的无监督方法。我们还通过将其应用于视频中的动作识别来展示其泛化能力。
