##### Abstract
This paper presents the experimental study revealing weaker performance of the automatic iris recognition methods for cataract-affected eyes when compared to healthy eyes. There is little research on the topic, mostly incorporating scarce databases that are often deficient in images representing more than one illness. We built our own database, acquiring 1288 eye images of 37 patients of the Medical University of Warsaw. Those images represent several common ocular diseases, such as cataract, along with less ordinary conditions, such as iris pattern alterations derived from illness or eye trauma. Images were captured in near-infrared light (used in biometrics) and for selected cases also in visible light (used in ophthalmological diagnosis). Since cataract is a disorder that is most populated by samples in the database, in this paper we focus solely on this illness. To assess the extent of the performance deterioration we use three iris recognition methodologies (commercial and academic solutions) to calculate genuine match scores for healthy eyes and those influenced by cataract. Results show a significant degradation in iris recognition reliability manifesting by worsening the genuine scores in all three matchers used in this study (12% of genuine score increase for an academic matcher, up to 175% of genuine score increase obtained for an example commercial matcher). This increase in genuine scores affected the final false non-match rate in two matchers. To our best knowledge this is the only study of such kind that employs more than one iris matcher, and analyzes the iris image segmentation as a potential source of decreased reliability.

本文介绍的实验研究表明，与健康的眼睛相比，白内障患眼的自动虹膜识别方法表现较差。关于该主题的研究很少，主要是纳入稀缺的数据库，这些数据库通常缺乏代表多种疾病的图像。我们建立了自己的数据库，收集了华沙医科大学37名患者的1288张眼睛图像。这些图像代表几种常见的眼部疾病，例如白内障，以及较少的普通病症，例如源自疾病或眼外伤的虹膜图案改变。图像在近红外光（用于生物测定学）中捕获，并且对于选定的情况也在可见光（用于眼科诊断）中捕获。由于白内障是数据库中样本数量最多的疾病，因此在本文中我们只关注这种疾病。为了评估性能恶化的程度，我们使用三种虹膜识别方法（商业和学术解决方案）来计算健康眼睛和受白内障影响的真实匹配分数。结果显示虹膜识别可靠性显着降低，表现为本研究中使用的所有三个匹配者的真实分数恶化（学术匹配者的真实分数增加12％，对于示例商业匹配者获得的真实分数增加高达175％） 。真实分数的增加影响了两个匹配者的最终错误不匹配率。据我们所知，这是唯一一项采用多个虹膜匹配器的研究，并将虹膜图像分割分析为可靠性降低的潜在来源。
