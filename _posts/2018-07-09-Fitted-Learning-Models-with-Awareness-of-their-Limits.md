##### Abstract
Though deep learning has pushed the boundaries of classification forward, in recent years hints of the limits of standard classification have begun to emerge. Problems such as fooling, adding new classes over time, and the need to retrain learning models only for small changes to the original problem all point to a potential shortcoming in the classic classification regime, where a comprehensive a priori knowledge of the possible classes or concepts is critical. Without such knowledge, classifiers misjudge the limits of their knowledge and overgeneralization therefore becomes a serious obstacle to consistent performance. In response to these challenges, this paper extends the classic regime by reframing classification instead with the assumption that concepts present in the training set are only a sample of the hypothetical final set of concepts. To bring learning models into this new paradigm, a novel elaboration of standard architectures called the competitive overcomplete output layer (COOL) neural network is introduced. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of COOL by applying it to fooling, separable concept learning, one-class neural networks, and standard classification benchmarks. The results suggest that, unlike conventional classifiers, the amount of generalization in COOL networks can be tuned to match the problem.

虽然深度学习已经推动了分类的界限，但近年来已开始出现标准分类限制的暗示。诸如愚弄，随着时间添加新课程以及仅针对原始问题的小变化重新学习模型的需要等问题都指向经典分类机制中的潜在缺点，其中可能的类或概念的全面先验知识至关重要。如果没有这些知识，分类器就会误判他们的知识限制，因此过度概括会成为一致表现的严重障碍。为了应对这些挑战，本文通过重新分类来扩展经典制度，而不是假设训练集中存在的概念只是假设的最终概念集的一个样本。为了将学习模型引入这个新范例，引入了称为竞争性超完备输出层（COOL）神经网络的标准体系结构的新颖阐述。实验证明了COOL的有效性，将其应用于愚弄，可分离的概念学习，一类神经网络和标准分类基准。结果表明，与传统分类器不同，可以调整COOL网络中的泛化量以匹配问题。
