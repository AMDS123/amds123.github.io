##### Abstract
Consider a collaborative task that requires communication. Two agents are placed in an environment and must create a language from scratch in order to coordinate. Recent work has been interested in what kinds of languages emerge when deep reinforcement learning agents are put in such a situation, and in particular in the factors that cause language to be compositional-i.e. meaning is expressed by combining words which themselves have meaning. Evolutionary linguists have also studied the emergence of compositional language for decades, and they find that in addition to structural priors like those already studied in deep learning, the dynamics of transmitting language from generation to generation contribute significantly to the emergence of compositionality. In this paper, we introduce these cultural evolutionary dynamics into language emergence by periodically replacing agents in a population to create a knowledge gap, implicitly inducing cultural transmission of language. We show that this implicit cultural transmission encourages the resulting languages to exhibit better compositional generalization and suggest how elements of cultural dynamics can be further integrated into populations of deep agents.
