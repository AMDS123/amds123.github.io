##### Abstract
Due to exponential growth of complex data, graph structure has become increasingly important to model various entities and their interactions, with many interesting applications including, bioinformatics, social network analysis, etc. Depending on the complexity of the data, the underlying graph model can be a simple directed/undirected and/or weighted/un-weighted graph to a complex graph (aka multi-attributed graph) where vertices and edges are labelled with multi-dimensional vectors. In this paper, we present a novel weighted distance measure based on weighted Euclidean norm which is defined as a function of both vertex and edge attributes, and it can be used for various graph analysis tasks including classification and cluster analysis. The proposed distance measure has flexibility to increase/decrease the weightage of edge labels while calculating the distance between vertex-pairs. We have also proposed a MAGDist algorithm, which reads multi-attributed graph stored in CSV files containing the list of vertex vectors and edge vectors, and calculates the distance between each vertex-pair using the proposed weighted distance measure. Finally, we have proposed a multi-attributed similarity graph generation algorithm, MAGSim, which reads the output of MAGDist algorithm and generates a similarity graph that can be analysed using classification and clustering algorithms. The significance and accuracy of the proposed distance measure and algorithms is evaluated on Iris and Twitter data sets, and it is found that the similarity graph generated by our proposed method yields better clustering results than the existing similarity graph generation methods.

由于复杂数据的指数级增长，图结构对于模拟各种实体及其交互作用变得越来越重要，许多有趣的应用包括生物信息学，社交网络分析等。根据数据的复杂性，底层图模型可以是一个简单的有向/无向和/或加权/未加权的图到一个复杂的图（也称为多属性图），其中顶点和边用多维向量标注。本文提出了一种基于加权欧几里德范数的加权距离度量，该加权距离度量既是顶点属性又是边缘属性的函数，可用于分类和聚类分析等各种图形分析任务。所提出的距离度量具有灵活性以在计算顶点对之间的距离时增加/减小边缘标签的权重。我们还提出了MAGDist算法，该算法读取存储在包含顶点矢量和边缘矢量列表的CSV文件中的多属性图，并使用所提出的加权距离度量来计算每个顶点对之间的距离。最后，我们提出了一个多属性相似度图生成算法MAGSim，它读取MAGDist算法的输出，并生成一个可以使用分类和聚类算法进行分析的相似度图。在Iris和Twitter数据集上评估了所提出的距离度量和算法的重要性和准确性，发现由我们提出的方法产生的相似度图比现有的相似度图生成方法产生更好的聚类结果。
