##### Abstract
The morphology of blood vessels in retinal fundus images is an important indicator of diseases like glaucoma, hypertension and diabetic retinopathy. The accuracy of retinal blood vessels segmentation affects the quality of retinal image analysis which is used in diagnosis methods in modern ophthalmology. Contrast enhancement is one of the crucial steps in any of retinal blood vessel segmentation approaches. The reliability of the segmentation depends on the consistency of the contrast over the image. This paper presents an assessment of the suitability of a recently invented spatially adaptive contrast enhancement technique for enhancing retinal fundus images for blood vessel segmentation. The enhancement technique was integrated with a variant of Tyler Coye algorithm, which has been improved with Hough line transformation based vessel reconstruction method. The proposed approach was evaluated on two public datasets STARE and DRIVE. The assessment was done by comparing the segmentation performance with five widely used contrast enhancement techniques based on wavelet transform, contrast limited histogram equalization, local normalization, linear un-sharp masking and contourlet transform. The results revealed that the assessed enhancement technique is well suited for the application and also outperforms all compared techniques.

视网膜底图像中血管的形态是青光眼，高血压和糖尿病视网膜病等疾病的重要指标。视网膜血管分割的准确性影响用于现代眼科诊断方法的视网膜图像分析的质量。对比度增强是任何视网膜血管分割方法中的关键步骤之一。分割的可靠性取决于图像上对比度的一致性。本文介绍了一种最近发明的空间自适应对比度增强技术用于增强用于血管分割的视网膜眼底图像的适用性的评估。该增强技术与Tyler Coye算法的变体相结合，该算法通过基于霍夫线变换的血管重建方法得到改进。建议的方法在两个公共数据集STARE和DRIVE上进行评估。通过比较分割性能与基于小波变换，对比度受限直方图均衡化，局部归一化，线性非锐化掩蔽和轮廓波变换的五种广泛使用的对比度增强技术进行评估。结果显示，评估的增强技术非常适合应用，并且也优于所有比较技术。
