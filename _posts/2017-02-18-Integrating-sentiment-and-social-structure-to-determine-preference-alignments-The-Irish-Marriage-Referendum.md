##### Abstract
We examine the relationship between social structure and sentiment through the analysis of a large collection of tweets about the Irish Marriage Referendum of 2015. We obtain the sentiment of every tweet with the hashtags #marref and #marriageref that was posted in the days leading to the referendum, and construct networks to aggregate sentiment and use it to study the interactions among users. Our results show that the sentiment of mention tweets posted by users is correlated with the sentiment of received mentions, and there are significantly more connections between users with similar sentiment scores than among users with opposite scores in the mention and follower networks. We combine the community structure of the two networks with the activity level of the users and sentiment scores to find groups of users who support voting `yes' or `no' in the referendum. There were numerous conversations between users on opposing sides of the debate in the absence of follower connections, which suggests that there were efforts by some users to establish dialogue and debate across ideological divisions. Our analysis shows that social structure can be integrated successfully with sentiment to analyse and understand the disposition of social media users. These results have potential applications in the integration of data and meta-data to study opinion dynamics, public opinion modelling, and polling.

我们通过分析关于2015年爱尔兰婚姻公民投票的大量推文来分析社交结构和情绪之间的关系。我们通过在引导日期的日期中发布的＃标签和#marriageref来获得每个推文的情绪公民投票，并建立网络聚合情绪，并用它来研究用户之间的互动。我们的研究结果表明，用户发布的提及推特的情绪与提到的提及的情绪相关，并且在提及和跟随者网络中，具有相似情感分数的用户之间的关联显着多于具有相反分数的用户之间的关联。我们将两个网络的社区结构与用户的活动水平和情感分数相结合，找到支持公民投票“是”或“否”的用户组。在没有跟随者联系的情况下，在辩论的对立面上有许多用户之间的对话，这表明一些用户正在努力在整个意识形态部门之间建立对话和辩论。我们的分析表明，社会结构可以与情感成功地结合起来，分析和理解社交媒体用户的配置。这些结果在将数据和元数据整合到研究意见动态，舆论建模和投票中有潜在的应用。
