##### Abstract
The common view that our creativity is what makes us uniquely human suggests that incorporating research on human creativity into generative deep learning techniques might be a fruitful avenue for making their outputs more compelling and human-like. Using an original synthesis of Deep Dream-based convolutional neural networks and cognitive based computational art rendering systems, we show how honing theory, intrinsic motivation, and the notion of a 'seed incident' can be implemented computationally, and demonstrate their impact on the resulting generative art. Conversely, we discuss how explorations in deep learn-ing convolutional neural net generative systems can inform our understanding of human creativity. We conclude with ideas for further cross-fertilization between AI based computational creativity and psychology of creativity.
