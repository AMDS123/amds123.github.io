##### Abstract
Estimation of the fetal heart rate (FHR) has gained interest in the last century, low heart rate variability has been studied to identify intrauterine growth restricted fetuses (prepartum), and abnormal FHR patterns have been associated with fetal distress during delivery (intrapartum). Several monitoring techniques have been proposed for FHR estimation, including auscultation and Doppler ultrasound. This thesis focuses on the extraction of the non-invasive fetal electrocardiogram (NI-FECG) recorded from a limited set of abdominal sensors. The main challenge with NI-FECG extraction techniques is the low signal-to-noise ratio of the FECG signal on the abdominal mixture signal which consists of a dominant maternal ECG component, FECG and noise. However the NI-FECG offers many advantages over the alternative fetal monitoring techniques, the most important one being the opportunity to enable morphological analysis of the FECG which is vital for determining whether an observed FHR event is normal or pathological. In order to advance the field of NI-FECG signal processing, the development of standardised public databases and benchmarking of a number of published and novel algorithms was necessary.

在上个世纪，胎儿心率（FHR）的估算已经引起人们的兴趣，已经研究了低心率变异性来识别宫内生长受限胎儿（产前），并且异常FHR模式与分娩期间（分娩期间）胎儿窘迫相关。已经提出了几种监测技术用于FHR估计，包括听诊和多普勒超声。本文重点研究从有限的腹部传感器记录的无创胎儿心电图（NI-FECG）的提取。 NI-FECG提取技术的主要挑战是腹部混合信号上的FECG信号的低信噪比，其由主要的母体ECG分量，FECG和噪声组成。然而NI-FECG提供了许多优于替代胎儿监测技术的优点，其中最重要的是有机会实现FECG的形态学分析，这对于确定观察到的FHR事件是正常的还是病理性的至关重要的。为了推进NI-FECG信号处理领域，标准化公共数据库的发展以及许多已发表和新颖的算法的基准是必要的。
