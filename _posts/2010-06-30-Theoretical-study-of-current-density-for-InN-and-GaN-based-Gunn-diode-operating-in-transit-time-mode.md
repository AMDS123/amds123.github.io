##### Abstract
We are the first to report the frequency response and corresponding current density of a wurtzite phase Indium Nitride (InN)-based vertical configuration Gunn diode at 1 \mu m active length. Domain growths dynamics with respect to space and time, variation of domain velocity and the field outside the vicinity of the domain with respect to domain field have also been studied using the presented mathematical equations. It has been found that, InN-based Gunn diodes are capable to operate around 224 GHz with 691 kA/cm2 current density at 300 K. For comparison purpose, all these characteristics have been evaluated for Gunn diodes of different active lengths based on wurtzite phase Gallium Nitride (GaN). Simulated results are consistent with the other reports on GaN-based Gunn diode.
