##### Abstract
Coronary artery disease (CAD) is one of the leading causes of cardiovascular disease deaths. CAD condition progresses rapidly, if not diagnosed and treated at an early stage may eventually lead to an irreversible state of the heart muscle death. Invasive coronary arteriography is the gold standard technique for CAD diagnosis. Coronary arteriography texts describe which part has stenosis and how much stenosis is in details. It is crucial to conduct the severity classification of CAD. In this paper, we propose a recurrent capsule network (RCN) to extract semantic relations between clinical named entities in Chinese coronary arteriography texts, through which we can automatically find out the maximal stenosis for each lumen to inference how severe CAD is according to the improved method of Gensini. Experimental results on the corpus collected from Shanghai Shuguang Hospital show that our proposed RCN model achieves a F$_1$-score of 0.9641 in relation extraction, which outperforms the baseline methods.

冠状动脉疾病（CAD）是心血管疾病死亡的主要原因之一。 CAD病情进展迅速，如果没有诊断并且在早期治疗可能最终导致心肌死亡的不可逆状态。侵入性冠状动脉造影是CAD诊断的金标准技术。冠状动脉造影文本描述哪个部位有狭窄和狭窄多少。进行CAD的严重性分类至关重要。在本文中，我们提出了一个复发性胶囊网络（RCN）来提取中国冠状动脉造影文本中临床命名实体之间的语义关系，通过它我们可以自动找出每个腔的最大狭窄，以推断出CAD的严重程度如何改善Gensini的方法。从上海曙光医院收集的语料库的实验结果表明，我们提出的RCN模型在关系提取中达到了F $ _1 $ -score 0.9641，优于基线方法。
