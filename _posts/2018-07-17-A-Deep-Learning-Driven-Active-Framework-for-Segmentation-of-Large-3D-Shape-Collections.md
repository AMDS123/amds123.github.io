##### Abstract
High-level shape understanding and technique evaluation on large repositories of 3D shapes often benefit from additional information known about the shapes. One example of such information is the semantic segmentation of a shape into functional or meaningful parts. Generating accurate segmentations with meaningful segment boundaries is, however, a costly process, typically requiring large amounts of user time to achieve high quality results. In this paper we present an active learning framework for large dataset segmentation, which iteratively provides the user with new predictions by training new models based on already segmented shapes. Our proposed pipeline consists of three novel components. First, we a propose a fast and relatively accurate feature-based deep learning model to provide dataset-wide segmentation predictions. Second, we propose an information theory measure to estimate the prediction quality and for ordering subsequent fast and meaningful shape selection. Our experiments show that such suggestive ordering helps reduce users time and effort, produce high quality predictions, and construct a model that generalizes well. Finally, we provide effective segmentation refinement features to help the user quickly correct any incorrect predictions. We show that our framework is more accurate and in general more efficient than state-of-the-art, for massive dataset segmentation with while also providing consistent segment boundaries.

对大型3D形状存储库的高级形状理解和技术评估通常受益于已知的关于形状的附加信息。这种信息的一个例子是将形状语义分割成功能或有意义的部分。然而，生成具有有意义的分段边界的精确分段是一个昂贵的过程，通常需要大量的用户时间来实现高质量的结果。在本文中，我们提出了一个用于大型数据集分割的主动学习框架，它通过基于已经分割的形状训练新模型来迭代地为用户提供新的预测。我们提出的管道由三个新组件组成。首先，我们提出了一种快速且相对准确的基于特征的深度学习模型，以提供数据集范围的分割预测。其次，我们提出了一种信息理论测量方法来估计预测质量，并对随后快速有意义的形状选择进行排序。我们的实验表明，这种暗示性排序有助于减少用户的时间和精力，产生高质量的预测，并构建一个概括良好的模型。最后，我们提供有效的细分细化功能，以帮助用户快速纠正任何不正确的预测。我们表明，我们的框架比现有技术更加准确，通常更有效，用于大规模数据集分割，同时还提供一致的分段边界。
