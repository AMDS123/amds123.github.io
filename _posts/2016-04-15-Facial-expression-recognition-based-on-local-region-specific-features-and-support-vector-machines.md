##### Abstract
Facial expressions are one of the most powerful, natural and immediate means for human being to communicate their emotions and intensions. Recognition of facial expression has many applications including human-computer interaction, cognitive science, human emotion analysis, personality development etc. In this paper, we propose a new method for the recognition of facial expressions from single image frame that uses combination of appearance and geometric features with support vector machines classification. In general, appearance features for the recognition of facial expressions are computed by dividing face region into regular grid (holistic representation). But, in this paper we extracted region specific appearance features by dividing the whole face region into domain specific local regions. Geometric features are also extracted from corresponding domain specific regions. In addition, important local regions are determined by using incremental search approach which results in the reduction of feature dimension and improvement in recognition accuracy. The results of facial expressions recognition using features from domain specific regions are also compared with the results obtained using holistic representation. The performance of the proposed facial expression recognition system has been validated on publicly available extended Cohn-Kanade (CK+) facial expression data sets.

##### Abstract (translated by Google)
面部表情是人类交流情绪和内涵最有力，最自然，最直接的手段之一。面部表情的识别在人机交互，认知科学，人类情感分析，个性发展等方面有着广泛的应用。本文提出了一种利用外观与几何相结合的单幅图像识别面部表情的新方法支持向量机分类的功能。通常，通过将面部区域划分为规则网格（整体表示）来计算面部表情识别的外观特征。但是，在本文中，我们通过将整个人脸区域划分为区域特定的局部区域来提取特定区域的外观特征。几何特征也从相应的域特定区域提取。此外，重要的局部区域是通过增量搜索方法来确定的，这导致了特征维数的减少和识别精度的提高。还将使用来自特定领域的特征的面部表情识别的结果与使用整体表示获得的结果进行比较。所提出的面部表情识别系统的性能已经在公众可用的扩展的Cohn-Kanade（CK +）面部表情数据集上得到验证。
