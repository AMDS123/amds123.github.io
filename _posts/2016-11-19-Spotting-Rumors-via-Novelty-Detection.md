##### Abstract
Rumour detection is hard because the most accurate systems operate retrospectively, only recognizing rumours once they have collected repeated signals. By then the rumours might have already spread and caused harm. We introduce a new category of features based on novelty, tailored to detect rumours early on. To compensate for the absence of repeated signals, we make use of news wire as an additional data source. Unconfirmed (novel) information with respect to the news articles is considered as an indication of rumours. Additionally we introduce pseudo feedback, which assumes that documents that are similar to previous rumours, are more likely to also be a rumour. Comparison with other real-time approaches shows that novelty based features in conjunction with pseudo feedback perform significantly better, when detecting rumours instantly after their publication.

谣言检测是很难的，因为最准确的系统是回溯性的，只有在收集到重复信号后才会识别谣言。那时传闻可能已经蔓延并造成伤害。我们基于新颖性引入了一个新的功能类别，专门用于早期发现谣言。为了弥补重复信号的缺失，我们利用新闻线作为附加数据源。关于新闻文章的未经证实的（新颖的）信息被认为是谣言的一种表现。此外，我们引入伪反馈，假定与以前的谣言类似的文档更可能是一个谣言。与其他实时方法的比较表明，基于新颖性的特征与伪反馈相结合在发布后即刻检测到谣言时表现得更好。
