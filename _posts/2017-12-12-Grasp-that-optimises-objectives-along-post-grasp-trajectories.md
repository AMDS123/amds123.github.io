##### Abstract
In this article, we study the problem of selecting a grasping pose on the surface of an object to be manipulated by considering three post-grasp objectives. These objectives include (i) kinematic manipulation capability, (ii) torque effort \cite{mavrakis2016analysis} and (iii) impact force in case of a collision during post-grasp manipulative actions. In these works, the main assumption is that a manipulation task, i.e. trajectory of the centre of mass (CoM) of an object is given. In addition, inertial properties of the object to be manipulated is known. For example, a robot needs to pick an object located at point A and place it at point B by moving it along a given path. Therefore, the problem to be solved is to find an initial grasp pose that yields the maximum kinematic manipulation capability, minimum joint effort and effective mass along a given post-grasp trajectories. However, these objectives may conflict in some cases making it impossible to obtain the best values for all of them. We perform a series of experiments to show how different objectives change as the grasping pose on an object alters. The experimental results presented in this paper illustrate that these objectives are conflicting for some desired post-grasp trajectories. This indicates that a detailed multi-objective optimization is needed for properly addressing this problem in a future work.

在本文中，我们通过考虑三个后把握目标来研究在要被操纵的对象的表面上选择抓握姿势的问题。这些目标包括：（i）运动学操纵能力，（ii）扭矩努力，以及（iii）在抓握操纵动作期间发生碰撞时的冲击力。在这些作品中，主要的假设是给出了一个操作任务，即物体的质心（CoM）的轨迹。另外，要被操纵的物体的惯性特性是已知的。例如，机器人需要拾取位于A点的物体，并通过沿给定路径移动将其放置在B点。因此，要解决的问题是找到一个初始抓取姿势，该姿态在给定的后抓握轨迹上产生最大的运动操纵能力，最小的合力和有效质量。但是，这些目标在某些情况下可能会发生冲突，使得无法为所有这些目标获得最佳的价值。我们进行了一系列的实验，以显示不同的目标随着对象的抓取姿势的变化而变化。本文提出的实验结果表明，这些目标是相互矛盾的一些理想的后掌握轨迹。这表明在未来的工作中需要详细的多目标优化来妥善解决这个问题。
