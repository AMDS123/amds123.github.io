##### Abstract
Recognition of low resolution face images is a challenging problem in many practical face recognition systems. Methods have been proposed in the face recognition literature for the problem which assume that the probe is low resolution, but a high resolution gallery is available for recognition. These attempts have been aimed at modifying the probe image such that the resultant image provides better discrimination. We formulate the problem differently by leveraging the information available in the high resolution gallery image and propose a dictionary learning approach for classifying the low-resolution probe image. An important feature of our algorithm is that it can handle resolution change along with illumination variations. Furthermore, we also kernelize the algorithm to handle non-linearity in data and present a joint dictionary learning technique for robust recognition at low resolutions. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated using standard datasets and a challenging outdoor face dataset. It is shown that our method is efficient and can perform significantly better than many competitive low resolution face recognition algorithms.

低分辨率人脸图像的识别在许多实际的人脸识别系统中是具有挑战性的问题。方法已经在人脸识别文献中提出，假设探针分辨率低，但高分辨率图库可用于识别。这些尝试旨在修改探测图像，使得所得到的图像提供更好的区分。我们通过利用高分辨率图库图像中可用的信息来不同地制定问题，并提出一种用于对低分辨率探针图像进行分类的字典学习方法。我们的算法的一个重要特点是它可以处理分辨率随着光照变化。此外，我们还核化了处理数据非线性的算法，并提出了一种联合字典学习技术，用于低分辨率的鲁棒识别。所提出的方法的有效性使用标准数据集和具有挑战性的室外人脸数据集来演示。结果表明，我们的方法是有效的，并且可以比许多竞争性的低分辨率人脸识别算法表现得更好。
