##### Abstract
Existing music recognition applications require a connection to a server that performs the actual recognition. In this paper we present a low-power music recognizer that runs entirely on a mobile device and automatically recognizes music without user interaction. To reduce battery consumption, a small music detector runs continuously on the mobile device's DSP chip and wakes up the main application processor only when it is confident that music is present. Once woken, the recognizer on the application processor is provided with a few seconds of audio which is fingerprinted and compared to the stored fingerprints in the on-device fingerprint database of tens of thousands of songs. Our presented system, Now Playing, has a daily battery usage of less than 1% on average, respects user privacy by running entirely on-device and can passively recognize a wide range of music.

现有的音乐识别应用程序需要连接到执行实际识别的服务器。在本文中，我们将介绍一种低功耗的音乐识别器，它完全在移动设备上运行，并自动识别音乐，而无需用户交互。为了减少电池消耗，小型音乐检测器在移动设备的DSP芯片上持续运行，并且只有在确信音乐存在时才唤醒主应用处理器。一旦唤醒，应用处理器上的识别器被提供有几秒钟的指纹音频，并且与存储在成千上万首歌曲的设备指纹数据库中的指纹进行比较。我们提供的系统“正在播放”，平均每天的电池使用量不到1％，通过完全在设备上运行并尊重用户隐私，可以被动地识别各种音乐。
