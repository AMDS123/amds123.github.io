##### Abstract
Analyses of volcanic ash are typically performed either by qualitatively classifying ash particles by eye or by quantitatively parameterizing its shape and texture. While complex shapes can be classified through qualitative analyses, the results are subjective due to the difficulty of categorizing complex shapes into a single class. Although quantitative analyses are objective, selection of shape parameters is required. Here, we applied a convolutional neural network (CNN) for the classification of volcanic ash. First, we defined four basal particle shapes (blocky, vesicular, elongated, rounded) generated by different eruption mechanisms (e.g., brittle fragmentation), and then trained the CNN using particles composed of only one basal shape. The CNN could recognize the basal shapes with over 90% accuracy. Using the trained network, we classified ash particles composed of multiple basal shapes based on the output of the network, which can be interpreted as a mixing ratio of the four basal shapes. Clustering of samples by the averaged probabilities and the intensity is consistent with the eruption type. The mixing ratio output by the CNN can be used to quantitatively classify complex shapes in nature without categorizing forcibly and without the need for shape parameters, which may lead to a new taxonomy.

火山灰的分析通常通过用眼定性分类灰分颗粒或通过定量表征其形状和质地来进行。虽然可以通过定性分析对复杂形状进行分类，但由于难以将复杂形状分类为单一类，所以结果是主观的。虽然定量分析是客观的，但需要选择形状参数。在这里，我们应用卷积神经网络（CNN）对火山灰进行分类。首先，我们定义了由不同喷发机制（例如，脆性碎裂）产生的四种基本颗粒形状（块状，囊状，细长，圆形），然后使用仅由一种基底形状组成的颗粒训练CNN。 CNN可以识别90％以上的基准形状。使用训练好的网络，我们将基于网络输出的由多个基本形状组成的灰尘颗粒进行分类，这可以解释为四种基本形状的混合比。用平均概率和强度对样本进行聚类与喷发类型一致。由CNN输出的混合比可以用来定量分类自然界中的复杂形状，而不需要强制分类，也不需要形状参数，这可能导致新的分类。
