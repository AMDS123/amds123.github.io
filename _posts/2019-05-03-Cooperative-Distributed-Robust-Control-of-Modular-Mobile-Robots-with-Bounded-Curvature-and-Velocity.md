##### Abstract
A novel motion control system for Compliant Framed wheeled Modular Mobile Robots (CFMMR) is studied in this paper. This type of wheeled mobile robot uses rigid axles coupled by compliant frame modules to provide both full suspension and enhanced steering capability without additional hardware. The proposed control system is developed by combining a bounded curvature-based kinematic controller and a nonlinear damping dynamic controller. In particular, multiple forms of controller interaction are examined. A twoaxle scout CFMMR configuration is used to evaluate the different control structures. Experimental results verify efficient motion control of posture regulation.
