##### Abstract
The main constraint of wireless sensor networks (WSN) in enabling wireless image communication is the high energy requirement, which may exceed even the future capabilities of battery technologies. In this paper we have shown that this bottleneck can be overcome by developing local in-network image processing algorithm that offers optimal energy consumption. Our algorithm is very suitable for intruder detection applications. Each node is responsible for processing the image captured by the video sensor, which consists of NxN blocks. If an intruder is detected in the monitoring region, the node will transmit the image for further processing. Otherwise, the node takes no action. Results provided from our experiments show that our algorithm is better than the traditional moving object detection techniques by a factor of (N/2) in terms of energy savings.

无线传感器网络（WSN）在实现无线图像通信方面的主要制约因素是高能量需求，甚至可能超过未来电池技术的能力。在本文中，我们已经表明，可以通过开发提供最佳能量消耗的局部网内图像处理算法来克服这个瓶颈。我们的算法非常适合入侵检测应用。每个节点负责处理由N×N块组成的视频传感器捕获的图像。如果在监控区域内检测到入侵者，则节点将传输图像以供进一步处理。否则，该节点不采取任何行动。我们的实验结果表明，我们的算法在节能方面比传统的运动物体检测技术要好（N / 2）。
