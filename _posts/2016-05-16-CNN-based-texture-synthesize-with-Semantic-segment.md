##### Abstract
Deep learning algorithm display powerful ability in Computer Vision area, in recent year, the CNN has been applied to solve problems in the subarea of Image-generating, which has been widely applied in areas such as photo editing, image design, computer animation, real-time rendering for large scale of scenes and for visual effects in movies. However in the texture synthesize procedure. The state-of-art CNN can not capture the spatial location of texture in image, lead to significant distortion after texture synthesize, we propose a new way to generating-image by adding the semantic segment step with deep learning algorithm as Pre-Processing and analyze the outcome.

##### Abstract (translated by Google)
深度学习算法在计算机视觉领域显示出强大的能力，近年来，CNN已经被用于解决图像生成分区中的问题，已经在照片编辑，图像设计，计算机动画，真实大规模的场景渲染和电影中的视觉效果。但是在纹理合成过程中。现有CNN技术无法捕捉图像中纹理的空间位置，导致纹理合成后出现明显的失真，本文提出了一种将语义片段步骤与深度学习算法相结合作为预处理的新方法，分析结果。
