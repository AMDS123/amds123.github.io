##### Abstract
We propose a scalable computerized approach for large-scale inference of Liver Imaging Reporting and Data System (LI-RADS) final assessment categories in narrative ultrasound (US) reports. Although our model was trained on reports created using a LI-RADS template, it was also able to infer LI-RADS scoring for unstructured reports that were created before the LI-RADS guidelines were established. No human-labelled data was required in any step of this study; for training, LI-RADS scores were automatically extracted from those reports that contained structured LI-RADS scores, and it translated the derived knowledge to reasoning on unstructured radiology reports. By providing automated LI-RADS categorization, our approach may enable standardizing screening recommendations and treatment planning of patients at risk for hepatocellular carcinoma, and it may facilitate AI-based healthcare research with US images by offering large scale text mining and data gathering opportunities from standard hospital clinical data repositories.

我们提出了一种可扩展的计算机化方法，用于叙述性超声（US）报告中的肝脏成像报告和数据系统（LI-RADS）最终评估类别的大规模推断。虽然我们的模型是通过使用LI-RADS模板创建的报告进行培训的，但它也能够推断在LI-RADS指南建立之前创建的非结构化报告的LI-RADS评分。本研究的任何步骤均不需要标注人体数据;对于训练，LI-RADS分数自动从包含结构化LI-RADS分数的报告中提取，并将推导出的知识转化为非结构化放射学报告的推理。通过提供自动化的LI-RADS分类，我们的方法可以使肝癌患者的筛查建议和治疗计划标准化，并且可以通过从标准提供大规模文本挖掘和数据收集机会来促进基于AI的医疗研究与美国图像医院临床数据库。
