##### Abstract
Attention plays a critical role in human visual experience. Furthermore, it has recently been demonstrated that attention can also play an important role in the context of applying artificial neural networks to a variety of tasks from fields such as computer vision and NLP. In this work we show that, by properly defining attention for convolutional neural networks, we can actually use this type of information in order to significantly improve the performance of a student CNN network by forcing it to mimic the attention maps of a powerful teacher network. To that end, we propose several novel methods of transferring attention, showing consistent improvement across a variety of datasets and convolutional neural network architectures. Code and models for our experiments are available at this https URL

注意力在人的视觉体验中起着至关重要的作用。此外，近来已经证明，注意力也可以在将人工神经网络应用于计算机视觉和NLP等领域的各种任务中发挥重要作用。在这项工作中，我们表明，通过适当地定义对卷积神经网络的关注，我们实际上可以使用这种类型的信息来显着提高学生CNN网络的表现，迫使它模仿强大的教师网络的注意力图。为此，我们提出了几种转移注意力的新方法，显示了对各种数据集和卷积神经网络体系结构的持续改进。我们的实验的代码和模型可以在https网址上找到
