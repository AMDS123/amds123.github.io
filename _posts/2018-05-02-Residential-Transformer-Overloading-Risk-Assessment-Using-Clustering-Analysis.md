##### Abstract
Residential transformer population is a critical type of asset that many electric utility companies have been attempting to manage proactively and effectively to reduce unexpected failures and life losses that are often caused by transformer overloading. Within the typical power asset portfolio, the residential transformer asset is often large in population, having lowest reliability design, lacking transformer loading data and susceptible to customer loading behaviors such as adoption of distributed energy resources and electric vehicles. On the bright side, the availability of more residential operation data along with the advancement of data analytics techniques have provided a new path to further our understanding of local residential transformer overloading risks statistically. This research developed a new data-driven method to combine clustering analysis and the simulation of transformer temperature rise and insulation life loss to quantitatively and statistically assess the overloading risk of residential transformer population in one area and suggest proper risk management measures according to the assessment results. Case studies from an actual Canadian utility company have been presented and discussed in detail to demonstrate the applicability and usefulness of the proposed method.

##### Abstract (translated by Google)
住宅变压器数量是许多电力公司一直试图主动有效管理以减少通常由变压器超载引起的意外故障和寿命损失的关键资产类型。在典型的电力资产组合中，住宅变压器资产通常人口众多，可靠性设计最低，缺少变压器负载数据，并且易受客户负载行为的影响，例如采用分布式能源和电动汽车。值得一提的是，随着数据分析技术的进步，更多住宅运营数据的可用性为我们进一步了解当地住宅变压器超载风险提供了新的途径。本研究开发了一种新的数据驱动方法，将聚类分析与变压器温升和绝缘寿命损失模拟相结合，定量统计评估某一地区居民变压器人群的超载风险，并根据评估结果提出适当的风险管理措施。已经提出并详细讨论了来自加拿大实际公司的案例研究，以证明所提出的方法的适用性和有用性。
