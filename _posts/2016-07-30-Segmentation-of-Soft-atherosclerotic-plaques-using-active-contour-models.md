##### Abstract
Detection of non-calcified plaques in the coronary tree is a challenging problem due to the nature of comprising substances. Hard plaques are easily discernible in CTA data cloud due to apparent bright behaviour, therefore many approaches have been proposed for automatic segmentation of calcified plaques. In contrast soft plaques show very small difference in intensity with respect to surrounding heart tissues & blood voxels. This similarity in intensity makes the isolation and detection of soft plaques very difficult. This work aims to develop framework for segmentation of vulnerable plaques with minimal user dependency. In first step automatic seed point has been established based on the fact that coronary artery behaves as tubular structure through axial slices. In the following step the behaviour of contrast agent has been modelled mathematically to reflect the dye diffusion in respective CTA volume. Consequently based on detected seed point & intensity behaviour, localized active contour segmentation has been applied to extract complete coronary tree. Bidirectional segmentation has been applied to avoid loss of coronary information due to the seed point location whereas auto adjustment feature of contour grabs new emerging branches. Medial axis for extracted coronary tree is generated using fast marching method for obtaining curve planar reformation for validation of contrast agent behaviour. Obtained coronary tree is to be evaluated for soft plaques in second phase of this research.

由于包含物质的性质，检测冠状动脉树中的非钙化斑块是具有挑战性的问题。硬斑块在CTA数据云中由于明显的明显行为而容易辨别，因此已经提出了许多用于自动分割钙化斑块的方法。相反，软斑块相对于周围的心脏组织和血液体素显示出非常小的强度差异。这种强度的相似性使得软斑块的分离和检测非常困难。这项工作的目标是开发脆弱的斑块分割与最小的用户依赖性的框架。在第一步中，基于冠状动脉通过轴向切片表现为管状结构的事实建立了自动化种子点。在接下来的步骤中，造影剂的行为已经在数学上被建模以反映在各个CTA体积中的染料扩散。因此，基于检测到的种子点和强度行为，已经应用局部主动轮廓分割来提取完整​​的冠状动脉树。已经应用双向分割来避免由于种子点位置而造成的冠状动脉信息丢失，而轮廓的自动调整特征抓住了新出现的分支。提取的冠状动脉树的中轴是使用快速前进方法获得曲线平面重建以验证造影剂行为。所获得的冠状动脉树在本研究的第二阶段将被评估为软斑块。
