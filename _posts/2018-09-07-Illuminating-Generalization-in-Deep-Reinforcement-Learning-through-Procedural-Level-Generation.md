##### Abstract
Deep reinforcement learning (RL) has shown impressive results in a variety of domains, learning directly from high-dimensional sensory streams. However, when neural networks are trained in a fixed environment, such as a single level in a video game, they will usually overfit and fail to generalize to new levels. When RL models overfit, even slight modifications to the environment can result in poor agent performance. In this paper, we explore how procedurally generated levels during training increase generality. We show that for some games procedural level generation enables generalization to new levels within the same distribution. Additionally, it is possible to achieve better performance with less data by manipulating the difficulty of the levels in response to the performance of the agent. The generality of the learned behaviors is also evaluated on a set of human-designed levels. Our results show that the ability to generalize to human-designed levels highly depends on the design of the level generators. We apply dimensionality reduction and clustering techniques to visualize the generators' distributions of levels and analyze to what degree they can produce levels similar to those designed by a human.

##### Abstract (translated by Google)
深层强化学习（RL）在各种领域都取得了令人瞩目的成果，直接从高维感觉流中学习。然而，当神经网络在固定环境中训练时，例如视频游戏中的单个级别，它们通常会过度拟合并且无法推广到新的水平。当RL模型过度配合时，即使对环境稍作修改也会导致代理性能下降。在本文中，我们将探讨在训练过程中程序生成的水平如何提高一般性。我们表明，对于某些游戏，程序级生成可以在同一分布中推广到新的级别。另外，通过响应于代理的性能来操纵级别的难度，可以用更少的数据实现更好的性能。学习行为的一般性也在一组人为设计的水平上进行评估。我们的结果表明，推广到人类设计水平的能力在很大程度上取决于水平发生器的设计。我们应用降维和聚类技术来可视化生成器的水平分布，并分析它们可以产生与人类设计的水平相似的程度。
