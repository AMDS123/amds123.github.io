##### Abstract
Understanding driving behaviors is essential for improving safety and mobility of our transportation systems. Data is usually collected via simulator-based studies or naturalistic driving studies. Those techniques allow for understanding relations between demographics, road conditions and safety. On the other hand, they are very costly and time consuming. Thanks to the ubiquity of smartphones, we have an opportunity to substantially complement more traditional data collection techniques with data extracted from phone sensors, such as GPS, accelerometer gyroscope and camera. We developed statistical models that provided insight into driver behavior in the San Francisco metro area based on tens of thousands of driver logs. We used novel data sources to support our work. We used cell phone sensor data drawn from five hundred drivers in San Francisco to understand the speed of traffic across the city as well as the maneuvers of drivers in different areas. Specifically, we clustered drivers based on their driving behavior. We looked at driver norms by street and flagged driving behaviors that deviated from the norm.

了解驾驶行为对于提高我们交通系统的安全性和流动性至关重要。数据通常通过基于模拟器的研究或自然驾驶研究来收集。这些技术可以帮助理解人口统计，道路状况和安全之间的关系。另一方面，它们非常昂贵和耗时。由于智能手机无处不在，我们有机会大幅补充更多的传统数据采集技术，从GPS，加速度计陀螺仪和照相机等手机传感器中提取数据。我们开发了统计模型，根据成千上万的驱动程序日志，提供对旧金山都会区驾驶行为的深入了解。我们使用新颖的数据来支持我们的工作。我们使用旧金山五百名司机的手机传感器数据来了解整个城市的交通速度以及不同地区驾驶员的操作。具体来说，我们根据驾驶行为聚集司机。我们通过街头观察驾驶员的标准，并且标记了违反常规的驾驶行为。
