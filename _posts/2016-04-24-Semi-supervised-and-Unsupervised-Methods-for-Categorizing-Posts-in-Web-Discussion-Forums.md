##### Abstract
Web discussion forums are used by millions of people worldwide to share information belonging to a variety of domains such as automotive vehicles, pets, sports, etc. They typically contain posts that fall into different categories such as problem, solution, feedback, spam, etc. Automatic identification of these categories can aid information retrieval that is tailored for specific user requirements. Previously, a number of supervised methods have attempted to solve this problem; however, these depend on the availability of abundant training data. A few existing unsupervised and semi-supervised approaches are either focused on identifying a single category or do not report category-specific performance. In contrast, this work proposes unsupervised and semi-supervised methods that require no or minimal training data to achieve this objective without compromising on performance. A fine-grained analysis is also carried out to discuss their limitations. The proposed methods are based on sequence models (specifically, Hidden Markov Models) that can model language for each category using word and part-of-speech probability distributions, and manually specified features. Empirical evaluations across domains demonstrate that the proposed methods are better suited for this task than existing ones.

##### Abstract (translated by Google)
全球数以百万计的人使用网络论坛来分享属于各种领域的信息，例如汽车，宠物，运动等。它们通常包含属于不同类别的帖子，例如问题，解决方案，反馈，垃圾邮件等。自动识别这些类别可以帮助为特定用户需求量身定制的信息检索。以前，一些监督方法试图解决这个问题;然而，这取决于是否有大量的训练数据。少数现有的无监督和半监督方法要么侧重于识别单个类别，要么不报告类别特定的性能。相比之下，这项工作提出了无监督和半监督的方法，不需要或最少的训练数据来实现这一目标，而不影响性能。还进行了细致的分析，讨论它们的局限性。所提出的方法基于序列模型（具体地，隐马尔可夫模型），其可以使用单词和词类概率分布以及手动指定的特征为每个类别建模语言。跨领域的实证评估表明，所提出的方法比现有方法更适合这一任务。
