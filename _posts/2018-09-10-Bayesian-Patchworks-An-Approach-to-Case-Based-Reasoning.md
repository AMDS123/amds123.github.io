##### Abstract
Doctors often rely on their past experience in order to diagnose patients. For a doctor with enough experience, almost every patient would have similarities to key cases seen in the past, and each new patient could be viewed as a mixture of these key past cases. Because doctors often tend to reason this way, an efficient computationally aided diagnostic tool that thinks in the same way might be helpful in locating key past cases of interest that could assist with diagnosis. This article develops a novel mathematical model to mimic the type of logical thinking that physicians use when considering past cases. The proposed model can also provide physicians with explanations that would be similar to the way they would naturally reason about cases. The proposed method is designed to yield predictive accuracy, computational efficiency, and insight into medical data; the key element is the insight into medical data, in some sense we are automating a complicated process that physicians might perform manually. We finally implemented the result of this work on two publicly available healthcare datasets, for heart disease prediction and breast cancer prediction.

##### Abstract (translated by Google)
医生通常依靠他们过去的经验来诊断患者。对于具有足够经验的医生，几乎每个患者都会与过去看到的关键病例有相似之处，并且每个新患者都可以被视为这些关键过去病例的混合物。因为医生通常倾向于这样推理，所以以相同方式思考的有效计算辅助诊断工具可能有助于定位可能有助于诊断的关键过去感兴趣的病例。本文开发了一种新颖的数学模型，以模拟医生在考虑过去案例时使用的逻辑思维类型。所提出的模型还可以为医生提供类似于他们自然推理病例的方式的解释。所提出的方法旨在产生预测准确性，计算效率和对医学数据的洞察力;关键因素是对医学数据的洞察，在某种意义上说，我们正在自动化医生可能手动执行的复杂过程。我们最终在两个公开的医疗保健数据集上实施了这项工作的结果，用于心脏病预测和乳腺癌预测。
