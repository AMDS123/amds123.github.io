##### Abstract
Capsule Networks are a recently proposed alternative for constructing Neural Networks, and early indications suggest that they can provide greater generalisation capacity using fewer parameters. In capsule networks scalar neurons are replaced with capsule vectors or matrices, whose entries represent different properties of objects. The relationships between objects and its parts are learned via trainable viewpoint-invariant transformation matrices, and the presence of a given object is decided by the level of agreement among votes from its parts. This interaction occurs between capsule layers and is a process called routing-by-agreement. Although promising, capsule networks remain underexplored by the community, and in this paper we present a new capsule routing algorithm based of Variational Bayes for a mixture of transforming gaussians. Our Bayesian approach addresses some of the inherent weaknesses of EM routing such as the 'variance collapse' by modelling uncertainty over the capsule parameters in addition to the routing assignment posterior probabilities. We test our method on public domain datasets and outperform the state-of-the-art performance on smallNORB using 50% less capsules.
