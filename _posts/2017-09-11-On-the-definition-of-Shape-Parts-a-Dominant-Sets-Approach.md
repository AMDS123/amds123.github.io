##### Abstract
In the present paper a novel graph-based approach to the shape decomposition problem is addressed. The shape is appropriately transformed into a visibility graph enriched with local neighborhood information. A two-step diffusion process is then applied to the visibility graph that efficiently enhances the information provided, thus leading to a more robust and meaningful graph construction. Inspired by the notion of a clique as a strict cluster definition, the dominant sets algorithm is invoked, slightly modified to comport with the specific problem of defining shape parts. The cluster cohesiveness and a node participation vector are two important outputs of the proposed graph partitioning method. Opposed to most of the existing techniques, the final number of the clusters is determined automatically, by estimating the cluster cohesiveness on a random network generation process. Experimental results on several shape databases show the effectiveness of our framework for graph based shape decomposition.

本文提出了一种新的基于图形的形状分解问题的方法。该形状被适当地转换成富含当地邻居信息的可见性图。然后将两步扩散过程应用于可见性图，从而有效地增强所提供的信息，从而导致更稳健和有意义的图构造。受集团概念作为严格的集群定义的启发，主导集算法被调用，稍作修改，以适应定义形状部分的具体问题。簇聚集性和节点参与向量是所提出的图分区方法的两个重要输出。与大多数现有技术相反，通过在随机网络生成过程中估计聚类凝聚力来自动确定聚类的最终数量。几个形状数据库的实验结果表明了我们的基于图形的形状分解框架的有效性。
