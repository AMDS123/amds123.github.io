##### Abstract
Lexically constrained decoding for machine translation has shown to be beneficial in previous studies. Unfortunately, constraints provided by users may contain mistakes in real-world situations. It is still an open question that how to manipulate these noisy constraints in such practical scenarios. We present a novel framework that treats constraints as external memories. In this soft manner, a mistaken constraint can be corrected. Experiments demonstrate that our approach can achieve substantial BLEU gains in handling noisy constraints. These results motivate us to apply the proposed approach on a new scenario where constraints are generated without the help of users. Experiments show that our approach can indeed improve the translation quality with the automatically generated constraints.
