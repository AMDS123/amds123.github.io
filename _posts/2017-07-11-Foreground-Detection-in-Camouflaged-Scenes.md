##### Abstract
Foreground detection has been widely studied for decades due to its importance in many practical applications. Most of the existing methods assume foreground and background show visually distinct characteristics and thus the foreground can be detected once a good background model is obtained. However, there are many situations where this is not the case. Of particular interest in video surveillance is the camouflage case. For example, an active attacker camouflages by intentionally wearing clothes that are visually similar to the background. In such cases, even given a decent background model, it is not trivial to detect foreground objects. This paper proposes a texture guided weighted voting (TGWV) method which can efficiently detect foreground objects in camouflaged scenes. The proposed method employs the stationary wavelet transform to decompose the image into frequency bands. We show that the small and hardly noticeable differences between foreground and background in the image domain can be effectively captured in certain wavelet frequency bands. To make the final foreground decision, a weighted voting scheme is developed based on intensity and texture of all the wavelet bands with weights carefully designed. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves superior performance compared to the current state-of-the-art results.

##### Abstract (translated by Google)
数十年来，由于其在许多实际应用中的重要性，前景检测已被广泛研究。现有的大多数方法都假设前景和背景具有明显的视觉特征，一旦获得了良好的背景模型，就可以检测到前景。但是，在许多情况下，情况并非如此。在视频监控中特别感兴趣的是伪装案件。例如，主动攻击者通过故意穿着与背景在视觉上相似的衣服进行伪装。在这种情况下，即使有一个体面的背景模型，检测前景对象也不是微不足道的。本文提出了一种能够有效检测伪装场景中前景物体的纹理指导加权投票（TGWV）方法。该方法采用平稳小波变换将图像分解为频带。我们发现，在某些小波频带中，可以有效地捕获图像域中前景和背景之间的小而难以察觉的差异。为了做出最终的前景决策，根据所有小波频带的强度和纹理，精心设计了权重，建立了加权投票方案。实验结果表明，所提出的方法相比于当前最先进的结果实现了优越的性能。
