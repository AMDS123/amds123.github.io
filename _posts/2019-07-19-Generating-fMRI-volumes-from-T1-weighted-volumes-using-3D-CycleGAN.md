##### Abstract
Registration between an fMRI volume and a T1-weighted volume is challenging, since fMRI volumes contain geometric distortions. Here we present preliminary results showing that 3D CycleGAN can be used to synthesize fMRI volumes from T1-weighted volumes, and vice versa, which can facilitate registration.
