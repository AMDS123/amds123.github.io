##### Abstract
In this paper we aim to answer questions based on images when provided with a dataset of question-answer pairs for a number of images during training. A number of methods have focused on solving this problem by using image based attention. This is done by focusing on a specific part of the image while answering the question. Humans also do so when solving this problem. However, the regions that the previous systems focus on are not correlated with the regions that humans focus on. The accuracy is limited due to this drawback. In this paper, we propose to solve this problem by using an exemplar based method. We obtain one or more supporting and opposing exemplars to obtain a differential attention region. This differential attention is closer to human attention than other image based attention methods. It also helps in obtaining improved accuracy when answering questions. The method is evaluated on challenging benchmark datasets. We perform better than other image based attention methods and are competitive with other state of the art methods that focus on both image and questions.

在本文中，我们旨在回答基于图像的问题，如果在训练过程中为数个图像提供问题 - 答案对的数据集。许多方法都着眼于通过使用基于图像的注意力来解决这个问题。这是通过在回答问题的同时关注图像的特定部分来完成的。人类在解决这个问题时也这样做。然而，以前的系统所关注的区域与人类关注的区域并不相关。由于这个缺点，精度受到限制。在本文中，我们提出通过使用基于范例的方法来解决这个问题。我们获得一个或多个支持和反对示例以获得不同关注区域。这种不同的注意力比其他基于图像的注意力方法更接近人的注意力。这也有助于在回答问题时获得更高的准确性。该方法在具有挑战性的基准数据集上评估。我们的表现优于其他基于图像的关注方法，并且与其他关注图像和问题的最先进的方法相比具有竞争力。
