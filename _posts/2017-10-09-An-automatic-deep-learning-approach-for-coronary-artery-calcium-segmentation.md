##### Abstract
Coronary artery calcium (CAC) is a significant marker of atherosclerosis and cardiovascular events. In this work we present a system for the automatic quantification of calcium score in ECG-triggered non-contrast enhanced cardiac computed tomography (CT) images. The proposed system uses a supervised deep learning algorithm, i.e. convolutional neural network (CNN) for the segmentation and classification of candidate lesions as coronary or not, previously extracted in the region of the heart using a cardiac atlas. We trained our network with 45 CT volumes; 18 volumes were used to validate the model and 56 to test it. Individual lesions were detected with a sensitivity of 91.24%, a specificity of 95.37% and a positive predicted value (PPV) of 90.5%; comparing calcium score obtained by the system and calcium score manually evaluated by an expert operator, a Pearson coefficient of 0.983 was obtained. A high agreement (Cohen's k = 0.879) between manual and automatic risk prediction was also observed. These results demonstrated that convolutional neural networks can be effectively applied for the automatic segmentation and classification of coronary calcifications.

冠状动脉钙化（CAC）是动脉粥样硬化和心血管事件的重要标志。在这项工作中，我们提出了一个系统的自动量化心电图触发非对比增强心脏计算机断层扫描（CT）图像的钙分数。所提出的系统使用监督的深度学习算法，即卷积神经网络（CNN）来对先前在心脏区域使用心脏图谱提取的候选病变（作为冠状动脉或不）进行分割和分类。我们用45个CT卷训练了我们的网络; 18卷用于验证模型，56用于测试。个别病变检出率为91.24％，特异性为95.37％，阳性预测值（PPV）为90.5％;比较系统获得的钙分数和由专家操作员人工评估的钙分数，获得0.983的皮尔逊系数。人工和自动风险预测之间的高一致性（Cohen的k = 0.879）也被观察到。这些结果表明，卷积神经网络可以有效地应用于冠状动脉钙化的自动分割和分类。
