##### Abstract
Ultrasound (US) is the most commonly used liver imaging modality worldwide. It plays an important role in follow-up of cancer patients with liver metastases. We present an interactive segmentation approach for liver tumors in US acquisitions. Due to the low image quality and the low contrast between the tumors and the surrounding tissue in US images, the segmentation is very challenging. Thus, the clinical practice still relies on manual measurement and outlining of the tumors in the US images. We target this problem by applying an interactive segmentation algorithm to the US data, allowing the user to get real-time feedback of the segmentation results. The algorithm has been developed and tested hand-in-hand by physicians and computer scientists to make sure a future practical usage in a clinical setting is feasible. To cover typical acquisitions from the clinical routine, the approach has been evaluated with dozens of datasets where the tumors are hyperechoic (brighter), hypoechoic (darker) or isoechoic (similar) in comparison to the surrounding liver tissue. Due to the interactive real-time behavior of the approach, it was possible even in difficult cases to find satisfying segmentations of the tumors within seconds and without parameter settings, and the average tumor deviation was only 1.4mm compared with manual measurements. However, the long term goal is to ease the volumetric acquisition of liver tumors in order to evaluate for treatment response. Additional aim is the registration of intraoperative US images via the interactive segmentations to the patient's pre-interventional CT acquisitions.

超声（US）是全世界最常用的肝脏成像模式。它在癌症肝转移患者的随访中起着重要的作用。我们提出了在美国收购中用于肝脏肿瘤的交互式分割方法。由于美国图像中的图像质量低和肿瘤与周围组织之间的对比度低，分割是非常具有挑战性的。因此，临床实践仍然依赖人工测量和美国图像中肿瘤的概述。我们通过对美国数据应用交互式分割算法来针对这个问题，允许用户获得分割结果的实时反馈。该算法是由医生和计算机科学家共同开发和测试的，以确保将来在临床环境中的实际应用是可行的。为了涵盖来自临床常规的典型采集，已经用几十个与周围肝组织比较的肿瘤为高回声（较亮），低回声（较深）或等回声（类似）的数据集评估了该方法。由于该方法的交互式实时行为，即使在困难的情况下，也可以在几秒钟内找到满意的肿瘤分割，且无需参数设置，并且与手动测量相比，平均肿瘤偏差仅为1.4mm。然而，长期目标是缓解肝肿瘤的体积获取以评价治疗反应。另外的目的是通过交互式分割将术中美国图像登记到患者的介入前CT采集。
