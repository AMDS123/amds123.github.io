##### Abstract
Touch sensing can help robots understand their sur- rounding environment, and in particular the objects they interact with. To this end, roboticists have, in the last few decades, developed several tactile sensing solutions, extensively reported in the literature. Research into interpreting the conveyed tactile information has also started to attract increasing attention in recent years. However, a comprehensive study on this topic is yet to be reported. In an effort to collect and summarize the major scientific achievements in the area, this survey extensively reviews current trends in robot tactile perception of object properties. Available tactile sensing technologies are briefly presented before an extensive review on tactile recognition of object properties. The object properties that are targeted by this review are shape, surface material and object pose. The role of touch sensing in combination with other sensing sources is also discussed. In this review, open issues are identified and future directions for applying tactile sensing in different tasks are suggested.

##### Abstract (translated by Google)
触摸感应可以帮助机器人了解他们的周围环境，特别是他们与之交互的物体。为此，机器人专家们在过去的几十年里已经开发了多种触觉传感解决方案，在文献中广泛报道。对传达的触觉信息的解读研究近年来也开始受到越来越多的关注。但是，这个话题的综合研究还有待报道。为了收集和总结这一领域的重大科学成果，本次调查广泛地回顾了目前机器人对象属性触觉感知的趋势。可用的触觉传感技术在对对象属性的触觉识别进行广泛的评论之前简要地呈现。该评论所针对的对象属性是形状，表面材质和对象姿势。还讨论了触摸传感与其他传感源结合的作用。在这次审查中，确定了开放性问题，并提出了在不同任务中应用触觉感应的未来方向。
