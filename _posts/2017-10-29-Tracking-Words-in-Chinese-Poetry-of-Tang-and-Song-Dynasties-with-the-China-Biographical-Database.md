##### Abstract
Large-scale comparisons between the poetry of Tang and Song dynasties shed light on how words, collocations, and expressions were used and shared among the poets. That some words were used only in the Tang poetry and some only in the Song poetry could lead to interesting research in linguistics. That the most frequent colors are different in the Tang and Song poetry provides a trace of the changing social circumstances in the dynasties. Results of the current work link to research topics of lexicography, semantics, and social transitions. We discuss our findings and present our algorithms for efficient comparisons among the poems, which are crucial for completing billion times of comparisons within acceptable time.

##### Abstract (translated by Google)
唐宋诗歌之间的大规模比较揭示了诗人如何使用和共用词语，搭配和表达。有些词只在唐诗中使用，有些词只在宋诗中使用才会引起语言学的有趣研究。唐宋诗歌中最常见的色彩是不同的，这些都反映了朝代变迁的社会环境。目前的研究成果与词汇学，语义学和社会转型等研究课题相关。我们讨论我们的研究结果，并提出我们的算法进行有效的比较诗歌，这是在可接受的时间内完成十亿次比较的关键。
