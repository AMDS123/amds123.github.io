##### Abstract
In this paper, we study how to learn an appropriate lane changing strategy for autonomous vehicles by using deep reinforcement learning. We show that the reward of the system should consider the overall traffic efficiency instead of the travel efficiency of an individual vehicle. In summary, cooperation leads to a more harmonic and efficient traffic system rather than competition
