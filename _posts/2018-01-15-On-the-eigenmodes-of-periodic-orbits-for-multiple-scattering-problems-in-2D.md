##### Abstract
Wave propagation and acoustic scattering problems require vast computational resources to be solved accurately at high frequencies. Asymptotic methods can make this cost potentially frequency independent by explicitly extracting the oscillatory properties of the solution. However, the high-frequency wave pattern becomes very complicated in the presence of multiple scattering obstacles. We consider a boundary integral equation formulation of the Helmholtz equation in two dimensions involving several obstacles, for which ray tracing schemes have been previously proposed. The existing analysis of ray tracing schemes focuses on periodic orbits between a subset of the obstacles. One observes that the densities on each of the obstacles converge to an equilibrium after a few iterations. In this paper we present an asymptotic approximation of the phases of those densities in equilibrium, in the form of a Taylor series. The densities represent a full cycle of reflections in a periodic orbit. We initially exploit symmetry in the case of two circular scatterers, but also provide an explicit algorithm for an arbitrary number of general 2D obstacles. The coefficients, as well as the time to compute them, are independent of the wavenumber and of the incident wave. The results may be used to accelerate ray tracing schemes after a small number of initial iterations.

波传播和声散射问题需要大量的计算资源才能在高频率下精确地求解。渐近方法可以通过明确提取解的振荡性质，使其成本潜在地与频率无关。然而，在存在多个散射障碍物的情况下，高频波形变得非常复杂。我们考虑一个亥姆霍兹方程在两个维度上的边界积分方程的形式，涉及几个障碍物，为此之前已经提出了射线追踪方案。现有的射线追踪方案分析侧重于障碍子集之间的周期性轨道。人们观察到每个障碍物的密度经过几次迭代后会趋于平衡。在本文中，我们以泰勒级数的形式给出了这些密度平衡阶段的渐近逼近。密度代表了一个周期轨道的完整的反射周期。我们在两个圆形散射体的情况下最初利用对称性，而且为任意数量的一般2D障碍物提供显式算法。系数以及计算它们的时间与波数和入射波无关。这些结果可能被用来加速射线追踪方案，经过少量的初始迭代。
