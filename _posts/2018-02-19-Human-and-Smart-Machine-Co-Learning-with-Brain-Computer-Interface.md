##### Abstract
Machine learning has become a very popular approach for cybernetics systems, and it has always been considered important research in the Computational Intelligence area. Nevertheless, when it comes to smart machines, it is not just about the methodologies. We need to consider systems and cybernetics as well as include human in the loop. The purpose of this article is as follows: (1) To integrate the open source Facebook AI Research (FAIR) DarkForest program of Facebook with Item Response Theory (IRT), to the new open learning system, namely, DDF learning system; (2) To integrate DDF Go with Robot namely Robotic DDF Go system; (3) To invite the professional Go players to attend the activity to play Go games on site with a smart machine. The research team will apply this technology to education, such as, playing games to enhance the children concentration on learning mathematics, languages, and other topics. With the detected brainwaves, the robot will be able to speak some words that are very much to the point for the students and to assist the teachers in classroom in the future.

机器学习已经成为控制论系统非常流行的一种方法，并且它一直被认为是计算智能领域的重要研究。不过，对于智能机器来说，这不仅仅是方法论。我们需要考虑系统和控制论以及将人包含在循环中。本文的目的如下：（1）将Facebook的开源Facebook AI Research（FAIR）DarkForest程序与项目反应理论（IRT）整合到新的开放式学习系统DDF学习系统中; （2）将DDF Go与Robot即机器人DDF Go系统整合; （3）邀请专业的Go玩家参加该活动，使用智能机器在现场玩Go游戏。研究团队将这一技术应用于教育领域，比如玩游戏以加强儿童学习数学，语言和其他主题的专注。通过检测到的脑电波，机器人将能够说出一些对学生来说非常重要的单词，并在将来帮助老师上课。
