##### Abstract
OBJECTIVE:Motion-robust multi-slab imaging of hippocampal inner structure in vivo at 7T.MATERIALS AND METHODS:Motion is a crucial issue for ultra-high resolution imaging, such as can be achieved with 7T MRI. An acquisition protocol was designed for imaging hippocampal inner structure at 7T. It relies on a compromise between anatomical details visibility and robustness to motion. In order to reduce acquisition time and motion artifacts, the full slab covering the hippocampus was split into separate slabs with lower acquisition time. A robust registration approach was implemented to combine the acquired slabs within a final 3D-consistent high-resolution slab covering the whole hippocampus. Evaluation was performed on 50 subjects overall, made of three groups of subjects acquired using three acquisition settings; it focused on three issues: visibility of hippocampal inner structure, robustness to motion artifacts and registration procedure performance.RESULTS:Overall, T2-weighted acquisitions with interleaved slabs proved robust. Multi-slab registration yielded high quality datasets in 96 % of the subjects, thus compatible with further analyses of hippocampal inner structure.CONCLUSION:Multi-slab acquisition and registration setting is efficient for reducing acquisition time and consequently motion artifacts for ultra-high resolution imaging of the inner structure of the hippocampus.

目的：7T时体内运动稳定的多层板海马内结构成像。材料与方法：运动是超高分辨率成像的关键问题，如7T磁共振成像。采集协议被设计用于在7T对海马内部结构进行成像。它依赖于解剖细节可见性和运动鲁棒性之间的折衷。为了减少采集​​时间和运动伪影，覆盖海马的全板被分割成单独的板，采集时间较短。实施了一种强大的登记方法，将获得的平板结合在覆盖整个海马的最终3D一致的高分辨率平板内。对整个50个受试者进行评估，由三组采用三个采集设置采集的受试者组成;重点讨论了三个问题：海马内部结构的可见性，运动伪影的鲁棒性以及注册过程的性能。结果：总体而言，采用交错平板的T2加权采集证明是可靠的。多平板配准在96％的受试者中产生了高质量的数据集，因此与进一步的海马内部结构分析相一致。结论：多平板采集和配准设置可有效减少采集时间，从而有效降低超高分辨率成像的运动伪影的海马内部结构。
