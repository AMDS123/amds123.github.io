##### Abstract
A method to recover structural parameters of looped jointed objects from multiframes is being developed. Each rigid part of the jointed body needs only to be traced at two (that is at junction) points. This method has been linearized for 4-part loops, with recovery from at least 19 frames.

##### Abstract (translated by Google)
正在开发一种从多帧恢复环形连接对象的结构参数的方法。接合体的每个刚性部分只需要追踪两个点（即交点）。这种方法已被线性化为4部分循环，从至少19帧恢复。
