##### Abstract
Efficient Market Hypothesis is the popular theory about stock prediction. With its failure much research has been carried in the area of prediction of stocks. This project is about taking non quantifiable data such as financial news articles about a company and predicting its future stock trend with news sentiment classification. Assuming that news articles have impact on stock market, this is an attempt to study relationship between news and stock trend. To show this, we created three different classification models which depict polarity of news articles being positive or negative. Observations show that RF and SVM perform well in all types of testing. Na\"ive Bayes gives good result but not compared to the other two. Experiments are conducted to evaluate various aspects of the proposed model and encouraging results are obtained in all of the experiments. The accuracy of the prediction model is more than 80% and in comparison with news random labeling with 50% of accuracy; the model has increased the accuracy by 30%.

有效市场假说是股票预测的流行理论。由于其失败，在股票预测领域进行了大量的研究。这个项目是关于一个公司的财务新闻文章等非定量的数据，并用新闻情感分类预测其未来的股票走势。假设新闻文章对股市有影响，这是试图研究新闻和股票走势之间的关系。为了说明这一点，我们创建了三种不同的分类模型，描述新闻文章的正面或负面的极性。观察表明RF和SVM在所有类型的测试中表现良好。与其他两种方法相比，贝叶斯方法具有较好的效果，但与其他两种方法相比较，实验结果表明该模型的各个方面均得到了较好的效果，实验结果令人鼓舞，预测模型的准确率达到80％以上，与准确率为50％的新闻随机标注相比，该模型的准确性提高了30％。
