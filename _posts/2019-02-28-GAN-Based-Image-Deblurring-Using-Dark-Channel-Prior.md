##### Abstract
A conditional general adversarial network (GAN) is proposed for image deblurring problem. It is tailored for image deblurring instead of just applying GAN on the deblurring problem. Motivated by that, dark channel prior is carefully picked to be incorporated into the loss function for network training. To make it more compatible with neuron networks, its original indifferentiable form is discarded and L2 norm is adopted instead. On both synthetic datasets and noisy natural images, the proposed network shows improved deblurring performance and robustness to image noise qualitatively and quantitatively. Additionally, compared to the existing end-to-end deblurring networks, our network structure is light-weight, which ensures less training and testing time.
