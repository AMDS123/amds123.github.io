##### Abstract
Lossy image compression algorithms are pervasively used to reduce the size of images transmitted over the web and recorded on data storage media. However, we pay for their high compression rate with visual artifacts degrading the user experience. Deep convolutional neural networks have become a widespread tool to address high-level computer vision tasks very successfully. Recently, they have found their way into the areas of low-level computer vision and image processing to solve regression problems mostly with relatively shallow networks. We present a novel 12-layer deep convolutional network for image compression artifact suppression with hierarchical skip connections and a multi-scale loss function. We achieve a boost of up to 1.79 dB in PSNR over ordinary JPEG and an improvement of up to 0.36 dB over the best previous ConvNet result. We show that a network trained for a specific quality factor (QF) is resilient to the QF used to compress the input image - a single network trained for QF 60 provides a PSNR gain of more than 1.5 dB over the wide QF range from 40 to 76.

有损图像压缩算法被广泛用于减少通过网络传输并记录在数据存储介质上的图像的大小。然而，我们付出了高压缩率，视觉伪影降低了用户体验。深卷积神经网络已经成为非常成功地解决高级计算机视觉任务的广泛工具。最近，他们已经进入低级计算机视觉和图像处理领域，以解决大多数网络相对较浅的回归问题。我们提出了一个新的12层深卷积网络的图像压缩伪影抑制分级跳过连接和多尺度损失函数。与普通JPEG相比，我们在PSNR上实现了高达1.79 dB的提升，比之前的最佳ConvNet结果提高了0.36 dB。我们展示了针对特定品质因数（QF）训练的网络对于用于压缩输入图像的QF具有回弹性 - 针对QF 60训练的单个网络在宽QF范围（从40到60）提供了超过1.5dB的PSNR增益76。
