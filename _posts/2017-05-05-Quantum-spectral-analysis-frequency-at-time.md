##### Abstract
A quantum time-dependent spectrum analysis, or simply, quantum spectral analysis (QuSA) is presented in this work, and it is based on Schrodinger equation, which is a partial differential equation that describes how the quantum state of a non-relativistic physical system changes with time. In classic world is named frequency at time (FAT), which is presented here in opposition and as a complement of traditional spectral analysis frequency-dependent based on Fourier theory. Besides, FAT is a metric, which assesses the impact of the flanks of a signal on its frequency spectrum, which is not taken into account by Fourier theory and even less in real time. Even more, and unlike all derived tools from Fourier Theory (i.e., continuous, discrete, fast, short-time, fractional and quantum Fourier Transform, as well as, Gabor) FAT has the following advantages: a) compact support with excellent energy output treatment, b) low computational cost, O(N) for signals and O(N2) for images, c) it does not have phase uncertainties (indeterminate phase for magnitude = 0) as Discrete and Fast Fourier Transform (DFT, FFT, respectively), d) among others. In fact, FAT constitutes one side of a triangle (which from now on is closed) and it consists of the original signal in time, spectral analysis based on Fourier Theory and FAT. Thus a toolbox is completed, which it is essential for all applications of Digital Signal Processing (DSP) and Digital Image Processing (DIP); and, even, in the latter, FAT allows edge detection (which is called flank detection in case of signals), denoising, despeckling, compression, and superresolution of still images. Such applications include signals intelligence and imagery intelligence. On the other hand, we will present other DIP tools, which are also derived from the Schrodinger equation.

量子时间相关光谱分析（简称量子光谱分析，QuSA）是基于薛定谔方程，它是一个偏微分方程，描述了非相对论物理系统的量子态随时间变化。在经典世界中被称为时频（FAT），这在这里被提出相反，并且作为基于傅里叶理论的传统频谱分析频率相关的补充。此外，FAT是衡量信号侧翼对其频谱的影响的指标，傅立叶理论没有考虑到这一点，甚至更少。与傅立叶理论（即连续，离散，快速，短时间，分数和量子傅立叶变换以及Gabor）的所有衍生工具不同，FAT具有以下优点：a）具有出色能量输出处理; b）计算成本低，信号的O（N）和图像的O（N2）; c）不具有相位不确定性（幅度= 0的不确定相位），如离散和快速傅里叶变换（DFT，FFT） ），d）等等。实际上，FAT构成三角形（从现在开始是闭合的）的一侧，它由原始信号及时组成，基于傅立叶理论和FAT的谱分析。这样就完成了一个工具箱，它对于数字信号处理（DSP）和数字图像处理（DIP）的所有应用都是必不可少的。甚至在后者中，FAT允许边缘检测（在信号的情况下称为侧面检测），静止图像的去噪，去斑，压缩和超分辨。这种应用包括信号情报和图像情报。另一方面，我们将介绍其他DIP工具，这些工具也是从薛定谔方程导出的。
