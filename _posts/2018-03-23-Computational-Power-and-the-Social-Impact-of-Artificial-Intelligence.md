##### Abstract
Machine learning is a computational process. To that end, it is inextricably tied to computational power - the tangible material of chips and semiconductors that the algorithms of machine intelligence operate on. Most obviously, computational power and computing architectures shape the speed of training and inference in machine learning, and therefore influence the rate of progress in the technology. But, these relationships are more nuanced than that: hardware shapes the methods used by researchers and engineers in the design and development of machine learning models. Characteristics such as the power consumption of chips also define where and how machine learning can be used in the real world. Despite this, many analyses of the social impact of the current wave of progress in AI have not substantively brought the dimension of hardware into their accounts. While a common trope in both the popular press and scholarly literature is to highlight the massive increase in computational power that has enabled the recent breakthroughs in machine learning, the analysis frequently goes no further than this observation around magnitude. This paper aims to dig more deeply into the relationship between computational power and the development of machine learning. Specifically, it examines how changes in computing architectures, machine learning methodologies, and supply chains might influence the future of AI. In doing so, it seeks to trace a set of specific relationships between this underlying hardware layer and the broader social impacts and risks around AI.

##### Abstract (translated by Google)
机器学习是一个计算过程。为此，它与计算能力密不可分 - 机器智能算法所运行的芯片和半导体的有形材料。最明显的是，计算能力和计算架构决定了机器学习中训练和推理的速度，因此影响了技术进步的速度。但是，这些关系比这更微妙：硬件塑造了研究人员和工程师在机器学习模型的设计和开发中使用的方法。诸如芯片功耗之类的特征还定义了机器学习在现实世界中的使用位置和方式。尽管如此，许多关于AI目前进展浪潮的社会影响分析并没有实质性地将硬件维度带入其账户。虽然流行的新闻和学术文献中的一个共同表述是突出显示计算能力的大幅增加，这使得机器学习最近取得了突破，但分析通常不会超过这个观察值。本文旨在深入研究计算能力与机器学习发展之间的关系。具体而言，它考察了计算体系结构，机器学习方法和供应链中的变化如何影响AI的未来。在这样做的时候，它试图追踪这个底层硬件层和人工智能周围更广泛的社会影响和风险之间的一系列特定关系。
