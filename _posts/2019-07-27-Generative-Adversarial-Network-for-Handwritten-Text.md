##### Abstract
Generative adversarial networks (GANs) has proven hugely successful in variety of applications of image processing. However, generative adversarial networks for handwriting is relatively rare somehow because of difficulty of handling sequential handwriting data by Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). In this paper, we propose a handwriting generative adversarial network framework (HWGANs) for synthesizing handwritten stroke data. The main features of the new framework include: (i) A discriminator consists of an integrated CNN-Long-Short-Term- Memory (LSTM) based feature extraction with Path Signature Features (PSF) as input and a Feedforward Neural Network (FNN) based binary classifier; (ii) A recurrent latent variable model as generator for synthesizing sequential handwritten data. The numerical experiments show the effectivity of the new model. Moreover, comparing with sole handwriting generator, the HWGANs synthesize more natural and realistic handwritten text.
