##### Abstract
With the advent of semantic web, various tools and techniques have been introduced for presenting and organizing knowledge. Concept hierarchies are one such technique which gained significant attention due to its usefulness in creating domain ontologies that are considered as an integral part of semantic web. Automated concept hierarchy learning algorithms focus on extracting relevant concepts from unstructured text corpus and connect them together by identifying some potential relations exist between them. In this paper, we propose a novel approach for identifying relevant concepts from plain text and then learns hierarchy of concepts by exploiting subsumption relation between them. To start with, we model topics using a probabilistic topic model and then make use of some lightweight linguistic process to extract semantically rich concepts. Then we connect concepts by identifying an "is-a" relationship between pair of concepts. The proposed method is completely unsupervised and there is no need for a domain specific training corpus for concept extraction and learning. Experiments on large and real-world text corpora such as BBC News dataset and Reuters News corpus shows that the proposed method outperforms some of the existing methods for concept extraction and efficient concept hierarchy learning is possible if the overall task is guided by a probabilistic topic modeling algorithm.

随着语义网的出现，已经引入了各种工具和技术来呈现和组织知识。概念层次结构是一种这样的技术，由于其在创建被认为是语义网的组成部分的领域本体中的有用性而受到重视。自动化概念层次学习算法着重于从非结构化文本语料库中提取相关概念，并通过识别它们之间存在的一些潜在关系将它们连接在一起。在本文中，我们提出了一种从纯文本中识别相关概念的新方法，然后利用它们之间的包含关系来学习概念的层次结构。首先，我们使用概率主题模型对主题进行建模，然后利用一些轻量级的语言过程来提取语义丰富的概念。然后，我们通过识别一对概念之间的“是”关系来连接概念。所提出的方法是完全无监督的，并且不需要用于概念提取和学习的领域专用训练语料库。对大型和现实世界的文本语料库（如BBC新闻数据集和路透新闻语料库）的实验表明，所提出的方法胜过了一些现有的概念抽取方法，如果整体任务是由概率主题建模算法。
