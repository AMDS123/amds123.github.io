##### Abstract
Audio-visual event localization requires one to identify theevent which is both visible and audible in a video (eitherat a frame or video level). To address this task, we pro-pose a deep neural network named Audio-Visual sequence-to-sequence dual network (AVSDN). By jointly taking bothaudio and visual features at each time segment as inputs, ourproposed model learns global and local event information ina sequence to sequence manner, which can be realized in ei-ther fully supervised or weakly supervised settings. Empiricalresults confirm that our proposed method performs favorablyagainst recent deep learning approaches in both settings.
