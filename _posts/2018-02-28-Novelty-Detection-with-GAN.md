##### Abstract
The ability of a classifier to recognize unknown inputs is important for many classification-based systems. We discuss the problem of simultaneous classification and novelty detection, i.e. determining whether an input is from the known set of classes and from which specific class, or from an unknown domain and does not belong to any of the known classes. We propose a method based on the Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) framework. We show that a multi-class discriminator trained with a generator that generates samples from a mixture of nominal and novel data distributions is the optimal novelty detector. We approximate that generator with a mixture generator trained with the Feature Matching loss and empirically show that the proposed method outperforms conventional methods for novelty detection. Our findings demonstrate a simple, yet powerful new application of the GAN framework for the task of novelty detection.
