##### Abstract
Solving problems with Artificial intelligence in a competitive manner has long been absent in Bangladesh and Bengali-speaking community. On the other hand, there has not been a well structured database for Bengali Handwritten digits for mass public use. To bring out the best minds working in machine learning and use their expertise to create a model which can easily recognize Bengali Handwritten digits, we organized Bengali.AI Computer Vision Challenge.The challenge saw both local and international teams participating with unprecedented efforts.
