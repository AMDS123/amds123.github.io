##### Abstract
Machine vision applications are low cost and high precision measurement systems which are frequently used in production lines. With these systems that provide contactless control and measurement, production facilities are able to reach high production numbers without errors. Machine vision operations such as product counting, error control, dimension measurement can be performed through a camera. In this paper, a machine vision application is proposed, which can perform object-independent product counting. The proposed approach is based on Otsu thresholding and Hough transformation and performs automatic counting independently of product type and color. Basically one camera is used in the system. Through this camera, an image of the products passing through a conveyor is taken and various image processing algorithms are applied to these images. In this approach using images obtained from a real experimental setup, a real-time machine vision application was installed. As a result of the experimental studies performed, it has been determined that the proposed approach gives fast, accurate and reliable results.

机器视觉应用是生产线中经常使用的低成本和高精度测量系统。利用这些提供非接触式控制和测量的系统，生产设备可以无误地达到高产量。机器视觉操作，如产品计数，错误控制，尺寸测量可以通过摄像头进行。在本文中，提出了一种机器视觉应用程序，它可以执行对象无关的产品计数。所提出的方法基于Otsu阈值和霍夫变换，并且独立于产品类型和颜色执行自动计数。基本上在系统中使用一台相机。通过该相机拍摄通过传送带的产品图像，并将各种图像处理算法应用于这些图像。在使用从真实实验装置获得的图像的这种方法中，安装了实时机器视觉应用程序。作为实验研究的结果，已经确定所提出的方法提供了快速，准确和可靠的结果。
