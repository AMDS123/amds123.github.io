##### Abstract
Automatic video editing involving at least the steps of selecting the most valuable footage from points of view of visual quality and the importance of action filmed; and cutting the footage into a brief and coherent visual story that would be interesting to watch is implemented in a purely data-driven manner. Visual semantic and aesthetic features are extracted by the ImageNet-trained convolutional neural network, and the editing controller is trained by an imitation learning algorithm. As a result, at test time the controller shows the signs of observing basic cinematography editing rules learned from the corpus of motion pictures masterpieces.
