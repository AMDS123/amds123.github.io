##### Abstract
While deep neural networks have shown powerful performance in many audio applications, their large computation and memory demand has been a challenge for real-time processing. In this paper, we study the impact of scaling the precision of neural networks on the performance of two common audio processing tasks, namely, voice-activity detection and single-channel speech enhancement. We determine the optimal pair of weight/neuron bit precision by exploring its impact on both the performance and processing time. Through experiments conducted with real user data, we demonstrate that deep neural networks that use lower bit precision significantly reduce the processing time (up to 30x). However, their performance impact is low (&lt; 3.14%) only in the case of classification tasks such as those present in voice activity detection.

尽管深度神经网络在许多音频应用中表现出强大的性能，但是它们的大量计算和内存需求一直是实时处理的挑战。在本文中，我们研究了缩放神经网络的精度对两种常见音频处理任务，即语音活动检测和单通道语音增强的性能的影响。我们通过探索其对性能和处理时间的影响来确定最佳的权重/神经元位精度对。通过用真实用户数据进行的实验，我们证明使用较低比特精度的深度神经网络显着减少了处理时间（高达30x）。然而，仅在诸如语音活动检测中存在的分类任务的情况下，其性能影响很低（<3.14％）。
