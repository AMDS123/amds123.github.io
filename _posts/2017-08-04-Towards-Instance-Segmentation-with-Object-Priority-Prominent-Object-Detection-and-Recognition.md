##### Abstract
This manuscript introduces the problem of prominent object detection and recognition inspired by the fact that human seems to priorities perception of scene elements. The problem deals with finding the most important region of interest, segmenting the relevant item/object in that area, and assigning it an object class label. In other words, we are solving the three problems of saliency modeling, saliency detection, and object recognition under one umbrella. The motivation behind such a problem formulation is (1) the benefits to the knowledge representation-based vision pipelines, and (2) the potential improvements in emulating bio-inspired vision systems by solving these three problems together. We are foreseeing extending this problem formulation to fully semantically segmented scenes with instance object priority for high-level inferences in various applications including assistive vision. Along with a new problem definition, we also propose a method to achieve such a task. The proposed model predicts the most important area in the image, segments the associated objects, and labels them. The proposed problem and method are evaluated against human fixations, annotated segmentation masks, and object class categories. We define a chance level for each of the evaluation criterion to compare the proposed algorithm with. Despite the good performance of the proposed baseline, the overall evaluations indicate that the problem of prominent object detection and recognition is a challenging task that is still worth investigating further.

这篇文章介绍了人类似乎优先感知场景元素这一事实引发的突出物体检测和识别问题。这个问题涉及找到最重要的感兴趣的区域，分割该区域中的相关项目/对象，并为其分配对象类别标签。换句话说，我们正在解决显着性建模，显着性检测和对象识别这三个问题。这样一个问题表述背后的动机是（1）基于知识表示的视觉管线的好处，（2）通过共同解决这三个问题来模拟生物启发式视觉系统的潜在改进。我们正在预见将这个问题的表达扩展到具有实例对象优先级的完全语义分割的场景，以用于包括辅助视觉在内的各种应用的高级推断。随着新的问题定义，我们也提出了一个方法来实现这样一个任务。所提出的模型预测图像中最重要的区域，分割相关联的对象并对其进行标记。所提出的问题和方法是针对人类注意力，注释分割掩码和对象类别类别进行评估的。我们为每个评估标准定义一个机会水平，以比较所提出的算法。尽管提出的基线表现良好，但整体评估表明，突出的目标检测和识别问题是一个具有挑战性的任务，仍然值得进一步研究。
