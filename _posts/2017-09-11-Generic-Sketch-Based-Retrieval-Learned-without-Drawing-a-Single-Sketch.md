##### Abstract
We cast the sketch-based retrieval as edge-map matching. A shared convolutional network is trained to extract descriptors from edge maps and sketches, which are treated as a special case of edge maps. The network is fine-tuned solely from edge maps of landmark images. The training images are acquired in a fully unsupervised manner from 3D landmark models obtained by an automated structure-from-motion pipeline. The proposed method achieves the state-of-the-art results on a standard benchmark. On two other fine-grained sketch-based retrieval benchmarks, it performs on par with or comes just after the method specifically designed for the dataset.

我们将基于草图的检索作为边缘地图匹配。共享卷积网络被训练为从边缘地图和草图中提取描述符，这被视为边缘地图的特例。网络只是从地标图像的边缘地图进行微调。训练图像以完全无监督的方式从通过自动化结构 - 运动管线获得的3D界标模型获取。所提出的方法在标准基准上达到了最新的结果。在另外两个细粒度的基于草图的检索基准上，它与数据集专门设计的方法完全相同，
