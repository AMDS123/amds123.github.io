##### Abstract
We present a new color photometric stereo (CPS) method that can recover high quality, detailed 3D face geometry in a single shot. Our system uses three uncalibrated near point lights of different colors and a single camera. We first utilize 3D morphable model (3DMM) and semantic segmentation of facial parts to achieve robust self-calibration of light sources. We then address the spectral ambiguity problem by incorporating albedo consensus, albedo similarity, and proxy prior into a unified framework. We avoid the need for spatial constancy of albedo and use a new measure for albedo similarity that is based on the albedo norm profile. Experiments show that our new approach produces state-of-the-art results in single image with high-fidelity geometry that includes details such as wrinkles.
