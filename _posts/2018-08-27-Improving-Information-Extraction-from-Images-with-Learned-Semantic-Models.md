##### Abstract
Many applications require an understanding of an image that goes beyond the simple detection and classification of its objects. In particular, a great deal of semantic information is carried in the relationships between objects. We have previously shown that the combination of a visual model and a statistical semantic prior model can improve on the task of mapping images to their associated scene description. In this paper, we review the model and compare it to a novel conditional multi-way model for visual relationship detection, which does not include an explicitly trained visual prior model. We also discuss potential relationships between the proposed methods and memory models of the human brain.

许多应用程序需要理解图像，而不仅仅是对象的简单检测和分类。特别是，在对象之间的关系中携带了大量的语义信息。我们之前已经表明，视觉模型和统计语义先验模型的组合可以改进将图像映射到其相关场景描述的任务。在本文中，我们回顾了该模型，并将其与用于视觉关系检测的新型条件多路模型进行了比较，该模型不包括明确训练的视觉先验模型。我们还讨论了所提出的方法与人脑记忆模型之间的潜在关系。
