##### Abstract
The total variation (TV) model and its related variants have already been proposed for image processing in previous literature. In this paper a novel total variation model based on kernel functions is proposed. In this novel model, we first map each pixel value of an image into a Hilbert space by using a nonlinear map, and then define a coupled image of an original image in order to construct a kernel function. Finally, the proposed model is solved in a kernel function space instead of in the projecting space from a nonlinear map. For the proposed model, we theoretically show under what conditions the mapping image is in the space of bounded variation when the original image is in the space of bounded variation. It is also found that the proposed model further extends the generalized TV model and the information from three different channels of color images can be fused by adopting various kernel functions. A series of experiments on some gray and color images are carried out to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model.

在以前的文献中，已经提出了总体变化（TV）模型及其相关变体用于图像处理。本文提出了一种基于核函数的全局变差模型。在这个新颖的模型中，我们首先使用非线性映射将图像的每个像素值映射到希尔伯特空间，然后定义原始图像的耦合图像以构建核函数。最后，所提出的模型是在一个核函数空间中而不是在非线性映射的投影空间中求解的。对于所提出的模型，我们从理论上证明了当原始图像处于有界变化空间时，映射图像处于有界变化空间的条件下。同时发现该模型进一步扩展了广义电视模型，通过采用各种核函数可以融合来自三个不同频道的彩色图像的信息。对一些灰色和彩色图像进行了一系列实验，以验证所提出模型的有效性。
