##### Abstract
Herbarium sheets are invaluable for botanical research, and considerable time and effort is spent by experts to label and identify specimens on them. In view of recent advances in computer vision and deep learning, developing an automated approach to help experts identify specimens could significantly accelerate research in this area. Whereas most existing botanical datasets comprise photos of specimens in the wild, herbarium sheets exhibit dried specimens, which poses new challenges. We present a challenge dataset of herbarium sheet images labeled by experts, with the intent of facilitating the development of automated identification techniques for this challenging scenario.
