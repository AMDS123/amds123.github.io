##### Abstract
This short report describes our submission to the ISIC 2018 Challenge in Skin Lesion Analysis Towards Melanoma Detection for Task1 and Task 3. This work has been accomplished by a team of researchers at the University of Dayton Signal and Image Processing Lab. Our proposed approach is computationally efficient are combines information from both deep learning and handcrafted features. For Task3, we form a new type of image features, called hybrid features, which has stronger discrimination ability than single method features. These features are utilized as inputs to a decision-making model that is based on a multiclass Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier. The proposed technique is evaluated on online validation databases. Our score was 0.841 with SVM classifier on the validation dataset.
