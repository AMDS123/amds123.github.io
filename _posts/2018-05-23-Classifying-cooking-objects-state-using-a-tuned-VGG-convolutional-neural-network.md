##### Abstract
In robotics, knowing the object states and recognizing the desired states are very important. Objects at different states would require different grasping. To achieve different states, different manipulations would be required, as well as different grasping. To analyze the objects at different states, a dataset of cooking objects was created. Cooking consists of various cutting techniques needed for different dishes (e.g. diced, julienne etc.). Identifying each of this state of cooking objects by the human can be difficult sometimes too. In this paper, we have analyzed seven different cooking object states by tuning a convolutional neural network (CNN). For this task, images were downloaded and annotated by students and they are divided into training and a completely different test set. By tuning the vgg-16 CNN 77% accuracy was obtained. The work presented in this paper focuses on classification between various object states rather than task recognition or recipe prediction. This framework can be easily adapted in any other object state classification activity.

在机器人技术中，了解物体状态和识别所需状态非常重要。不同州的物体需要不同的抓握。为了实现不同的状态，需要不同的操作，以及不同的抓取。为了分析处于不同状态的对象，创建了烹饪对象的数据集。烹饪包括不同菜肴所需的各种切割技术（例如切丁，朱丽叶等）。有时候也很难识别人类烹饪对象的每种状态。在本文中，我们通过调整卷积神经网络（CNN）分析了七种不同的烹饪对象状态。对于这项任务，图像由学生下载和注释，并分为训练和完全不同的测试集。通过调整vgg-16 CNN获得77％的准确度。本文中介绍的工作重点是各种对象状态之间的分类，而不是任务识别或配方预测。这个框架可以很容易地适应任何其他对象状态分类活动。
