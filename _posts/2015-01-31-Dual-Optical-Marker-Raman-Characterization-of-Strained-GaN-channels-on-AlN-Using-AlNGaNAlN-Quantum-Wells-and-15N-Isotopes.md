##### Abstract
This work shows that the combination of ultrathin highly strained GaN quantum wells embedded in an AlN matrix, with controlled isotopic concentrations of Nitrogen enables a dual marker method for Raman spectroscopy. By combining these techniques, we demonstrate the effectiveness in studying strain in the vertical direction. This technique will enable the precise probing of properties of buried active layers in heterostructures, and can be extended in the future to vertical devices such as those used for optical emitters, and for power electronics.
