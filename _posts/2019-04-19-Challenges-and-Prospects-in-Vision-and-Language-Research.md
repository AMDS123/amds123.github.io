##### Abstract
Language grounded image understanding tasks have often been proposed as a method for evaluating progress in artificial intelligence. Ideally, these tasks should test a plethora of capabilities that integrate computer vision, reasoning, and natural language understanding. However, rather than behaving as visual Turing tests, recent studies have demonstrated state-of-the-art systems are achieving good performance through flaws in datasets and evaluation procedures. We review the current state of affairs and outline a path forward.
