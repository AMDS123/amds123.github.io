##### Abstract
The syntactic structure of a sentence can be modelled as a tree, where vertices correspond to words and edges indicate syntactic dependencies. It has been claimed recurrently that the number of edge crossings in real sentences is small. However, a baseline or null hypothesis has been lacking. Here we quantify the amount of crossings of real sentences and compare it to the predictions of a series of baselines. We conclude that crossings are really scarce in real sentences. Their scarcity is unexpected by the hubiness of the trees. Indeed, real sentences are close to linear trees, where the potential number of crossings is maximized.

句子的句法结构可以被建模为树，其中顶点对应于单词，边指示句法依赖性。一再声称，真实句子中边缘交叉点的数量很小。然而，缺乏基线或零假设。在这里，我们量化真实句子的交叉量，并将其与一系列基线的预测进行比较。我们得出这样的结论：交叉口在真正的句子中真的很少。由于树木的茂盛，他们的稀缺是出乎意料的。事实上，真正的句子接近线性树木，潜在的交叉数量是最大的。
