##### Abstract
Named Entity Recognition have been studied for different languages like English, German, Spanish and many others but no study have focused on Nepali language. In this paper we propose a neural based Nepali NER using latest state-of-the-art architecture based on grapheme-level which doesn't require any hand-crafted features and no data pre-processing. Our novel neural based model gained relative improvement of 33% to 50% compared to feature based SVM model and up to 10% improvement over state-of-the-art neural based model developed for languages beside Nepali.
