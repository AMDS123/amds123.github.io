##### Abstract
Human exhibit rich gender cues in both appearance and behavior. In computer vision domain, gender recognition from facial appearance have been extensively studied, while facial behavior based gender recognition studies remain rare. In this work, we first demonstrate that facial expressions influence the gender patterns presented in 3D face, and gender recognition performance increases when training and testing within the same expression. In further, we design experiments which directly extract the morphological changes resulted from facial expressions as features, for expression-based gender recognition. Experimental results demonstrate that gender can be recognized with considerable accuracy in Happy and Disgust expressions, while Surprise and Sad expressions do not convey much gender related information. This is the first work in the literature which investigates expression-based gender classification with 3D faces, and reveals the strength of gender patterns incorporated in different types of expressions, namely the Happy, the Disgust, the Surprise and the Sad expressions.

人类在外表和行为方面表现出丰富的性别暗示。在计算机视觉领域，面部表情的性别认知已被广泛研究，而基于面部表情的性别认知研究仍然很少。在这项工作中，我们首先证明面部表情影响3D人脸中呈现的性别模式，并且在相同表情中进行训练和测试时性别识别性能会提高。此外，我们设计的实验直接提取由面部表情导致的形态变化作为特征，用于基于表情的性别识别。实验结果表明，性别可以在Happy和Disgust表达式中以相当精确的方式被识别出来，而惊奇和悲伤表达式不会传达许多与性别相关的信息。这是文献中研究基于表情的三维面孔性别分类的第一篇文章，揭示了不同类型表达的性别模式的强度，即快乐，厌恶，惊奇和悲伤表达。
