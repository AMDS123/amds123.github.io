##### Abstract
In this work, we present a new Vector Space Model (VSM) of speech utterances for the task of spoken dialect identification. Generally, DID systems are built using two sets of features that are extracted from speech utterances; acoustic and phonetic. The acoustic and phonetic features are used to form vector representations of speech utterances in an attempt to encode information about the spoken dialects. The Phonotactic and Acoustic VSMs, thus formed, are used for the task of DID. The aim of this paper is to construct a single VSM that encodes information about spoken dialects from both the Phonotactic and Acoustic VSMs. Given the two views of the data, we make use of a well known multi-view dimensionality reduction technique known as Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA), to form a single vector representation for each speech utterance that encodes dialect specific discriminative information from both the phonetic and acoustic representations. We refer to this approach as feature space combination approach and show that our CCA based feature vector representation performs better on the Arabic DID task than the phonetic and acoustic feature representations used alone. We also present the feature space combination approach as a viable alternative to the model based combination approach, where two DID systems are built using the two VSMs (Phonotactic and Acoustic) and the final prediction score is the output score combination from the two systems.

在这项工作中，我们提出了一个新的语音话语的矢量空间模型（VSM）的口语方言识别的任务。一般而言，DID系统是使用从语音话语中提取的两组特征建立的;声学和语音。声学和语音特征被用来形成语音话语的矢量表示，以尝试编码有关口语方言的信息。由此形成的声学和声学VSM被用于DID的任务。本文的目的是构建一个单一的VSM，对来自Phonotactic和Acoustic VSM的口语信息进行编码。给定数据的两个视图，我们利用众所周知的称为典型相关分析（Canonical Correlation Analysis，CCA）的多视图降维技术来形成每个语音话语的单个向量表示，该语音话语从语音中编码方言特定的区别性信息和声学表示。我们将这种方法称为特征空间组合方法，并且表明我们的基于CCA的特征向量表示在阿拉伯语DID任务上比单独使用的语音和声学特征表示更好地执行。我们还提出了特征空间组合方法作为基于模型的组合方法的可行替代方案，其中使用两个VSM（声调和声学）构建两个DID系统，并且最终预测分数是来自两个系统的输出分数组合。
