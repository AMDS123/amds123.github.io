##### Abstract
Parallel data are an important part of a reliable Statistical Machine Translation (SMT) system. The more of these data are available, the better the quality of the SMT system. However, for some language pairs such as Persian-English, parallel sources of this kind are scarce. In this paper, a bidirectional method is proposed to extract parallel sentences from English and Persian document aligned Wikipedia. Two machine translation systems are employed to translate from Persian to English and the reverse after which an IR system is used to measure the similarity of the translated sentences. Adding the extracted sentences to the training data of the existing SMT systems is shown to improve the quality of the translation. Furthermore, the proposed method slightly outperforms the one-directional approach. The extracted corpus consists of about 200,000 sentences which have been sorted by their degree of similarity calculated by the IR system and is freely available for public access on the Web.

并行数据是可靠的统计机器翻译（SMT）系统的重要部分。这些数据越多，SMT系统的质量就越好。然而，对于某些语言对，如波斯语 - 英语，这类平行来源很少。在本文中，提出了一种双向方法来提取维基百科对齐的英语和波斯文档中的平行句子。使用两个机器翻译系统将波斯语翻译成英语，然后使用IR系统来测量翻译句子的相似性。将提取的句子添加到现有SMT系统的训练数据中以显示提高翻译质量。此外，所提出的方法略微优于单向方法。提取的语料库由大约200,000个句子组成，这些句子按照由IR系统计算的相似度进行排序，并且可以在Web上免费用于公共访问。
