##### Abstract
Recently, the long short-term memory neural network (LSTM) has attracted wide interest due to its success in many tasks. LSTM architecture consists of a memory cell and three gates, which looks similar to the neuronal networks in the brain. However, there still lacks the evidence of the cognitive plausibility of LSTM architecture as well as its working mechanism. In this paper, we study the cognitive plausibility of LSTM by aligning its internal architecture with the brain activity observed via fMRI when the subjects read a story. Experiment results show that the artificial memory vector in LSTM can accurately predict the observed sequential brain activities, indicating the correlation between LSTM architecture and the cognitive process of story reading.

近年来，由于长期的短期记忆神经网络（LSTM）在许多任务中的成功，引起了广泛的关注。 LSTM架构由一个存储单元和三个门组成，看起来与大脑中的神经元网络相似。但是，还缺乏LSTM架构的认知合理性证据和工作机制。在本文中，我们研究LSTM的认知合理性，将其内部结构与通过功能磁共振成像观察到的大脑活动进行对比。实验结果表明，LSTM中的人工记忆向量可以准确预测观察到的顺序性脑活动，说明LSTM体系结构与故事阅读认知过程之间的相关性。
