##### Abstract
A novel approach of image matching for rotating transformation is presented and studied. The approach is inspired by electromagnetic interaction force between physical currents. The virtual current in images is proposed based on the significant edge lines extracted as the fundamental structural feature of images. The virtual electromagnetic force and the corresponding moment is studied between two images after the extraction of the virtual currents in the images. Then image matching for rotating transformation is implemented by exploiting the interaction between the virtual currents in the two images to be matched. The experimental results prove the effectiveness of the novel idea, which indicates the promising application of the proposed method in image registration.

提出了一种新的旋转变换图像匹配方法。该方法受到物理电流之间的电磁相互作用力的启发。基于提取的重要边缘线作为图像的基本结构特征，提出了图像中的虚拟电流。在提取图像中的虚拟电流之后，研究两个图像之间的虚拟电磁力和相应的力矩。然后通过利用待匹配的两幅图像中的虚拟电流之间的相互作用来实现用于旋转变换的图像匹配。实验结果证明了该新思想的有效性，表明了该方法在图像配准中的应用前景。
