##### Abstract
Recent work has shown the possibility of adversarial attacks on automatic speechrecognition (ASR) systems. However, in the vast majority of work in this area, theattacks have been executed only in the digital space, or have involved short phrasesand static room settings. In this paper, we demonstrate a physically realizableaudio adversarial attack. We base our approach specifically on a psychoacoustic-property-based loss function, and automated generation of room impulse responses, to create adversarial attacks that are robust when played over a speaker in multiple environments. We show that such attacks are possible even while being virtually imperceptible to listeners.
