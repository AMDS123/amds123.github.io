##### Abstract
We present a new social animal inspired emotional swarm intelligence technique. This technique is used to solve a variant of the popular collective robots problem called foraging. We show with a simulation study how simple interaction rules based on sensations like hunger and loneliness can lead to globally coherent emergent behavior which allows sensor constrained robots to solve the given problem
