##### Abstract
Adsorption of small ligands on semiconductor surfaces is a possible route to modify these surfaces so that they can be used in biosensing and optoelectronic devices. In this work we perform density-functional theory calculations of electronic and optical properties of small ligands on GaN-(10$\bar1$0) surfaces. From the investigated anchor groups we show that thiol groups introduce states into the GaN band gap. However, these state are not optically active, at least for these perfect surfaces. This means that more realistic surfaces need to be considered to suggest how surface modification can enhance the optical properties of GaN non-polar surfaces.
