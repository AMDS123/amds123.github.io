##### Abstract
In this paper, we briefly review the basic scheme of the pseudoinverse learning (PIL) algorithm and present some discussions on the PIL, as well as its variants. The PIL algorithm, first presented in 1995, is a non-gradient descent and non-iterative learning algorithm for multi-layer neural networks and has several advantages compared with gradient descent based algorithms. Some new viewpoints to PIL algorithm are presented, and several common pitfalls in practical implementation of the neural network learning task are also addressed. In addition, we show that so called extreme learning machine is a Variant crEated by Simple name alTernation (VEST) of the PIL algorithm for single hidden layer feedforward neural networks.

在本文中，我们简要回顾了伪逆向学习（PIL）算法的基本方案，并对PIL及其变体进行了一些讨论。 PIL算法首次出现于1995年，是一种用于多层神经网络的非梯度下降和非迭代学习算法，与基于梯度下降的算法相比具有几个优点。提出了PIL算法的一些新观点，并讨论了神经网络学习任务实际实现中的几个常见缺陷。此外，我们表明，所谓的极端学习机是一种变体，由PIL算法的简单名称alTernation（VEST）用于单个隐藏层前馈神经网络。
