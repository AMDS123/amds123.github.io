##### Abstract
In this paper, we propose an online learning algorithm based on a Rao-Blackwellized particle filter for spatial concept acquisition and mapping. We have proposed a nonparametric Bayesian spatial concept acquisition model (SpCoA). We propose a novel method (SpCoSLAM) integrating SpCoA and FastSLAM in the theoretical framework of the Bayesian generative model. The proposed method can simultaneously learn place categories and lexicons while incrementally generating an environmental map. Furthermore, the proposed method has scene image features and a language model added to SpCoA. In the experiments, we tested online learning of spatial concepts and environmental maps in a novel environment of which the robot did not have a map. Then, we evaluated the results of online learning of spatial concepts and lexical acquisition. The experimental results demonstrated that the robot was able to more accurately learn the relationships between words and the place in the environmental map incrementally by using the proposed method.

在本文中，我们提出了一种基于Rao-Blackwellized粒子滤波器的在线学习算法，用于空间概念采集和映射。我们提出了非参数贝叶斯空间概念采集模型（SpCoA）。我们提出了一种将SpCoA和FastSLAM集成在贝叶斯生成模型的理论框架中的新方法（SpCoSLAM）。所提出的方法可以同时学习地点类别和词典，同时递增地产生环境地图。此外，该方法具有场景图像特征和语言模型添加到SpCoA。在实验中，我们在机器人没有地图的新环境中测试空间概念和环境地图的在线学习。然后，我们评估空间概念和词汇习得的在线学习结果。实验结果表明，该机器人能够更准确地通过使用所提出的方法来逐步学习单词和环境地图中的地点之间的关系。
