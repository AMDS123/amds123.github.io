##### Abstract
In this work, we present a novel multi-modal dataset consisting of eye movements and verbal descriptions recorded synchronously over images. Using this data, we study the differences between human attention in free-viewing and image captioning tasks. We look into the relationship between human attention and language constructs during perception and sentence articulation. We also compare human and machine attention, in particular the top-down soft attention approach that is argued to mimick human attention, in captioning tasks. Our study reveals that, (1) human attention behaviour in free-viewing is different than image description as humans tend to fixate on a greater variety of regions under the latter task; (2) there is a strong relationship between the described objects and the objects attended by subjects ($97\%$ of described objects are being attended); (3) a convolutional neural network as feature encoder captures regions that human attend under image captioning to a great extent (around $78\%$); (4) the soft-attention as the top-down mechanism does not agree with human attention behaviour neither spatially nor temporally; and (5) soft-attention does not add strong beneficial human-like attention behaviour for the task of captioning as it has low correlation between caption scores and attention consistency scores, indicating a large gap between human and machine in regard to top-down attention.
