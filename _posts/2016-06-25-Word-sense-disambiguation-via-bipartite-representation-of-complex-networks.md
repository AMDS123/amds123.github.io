##### Abstract
In recent years, concepts and methods of complex networks have been employed to tackle the word sense disambiguation (WSD) task by representing words as nodes, which are connected if they are semantically similar. Despite the increasingly number of studies carried out with such models, most of them use networks just to represent the data, while the pattern recognition performed on the attribute space is performed using traditional learning techniques. In other words, the structural relationship between words have not been explicitly used in the pattern recognition process. In addition, only a few investigations have probed the suitability of representations based on bipartite networks and graphs (bigraphs) for the problem, as many approaches consider all possible links between words. In this context, we assess the relevance of a bipartite network model representing both feature words (i.e. the words characterizing the context) and target (ambiguous) words to solve ambiguities in written texts. Here, we focus on the semantical relationships between these two type of words, disregarding the relationships between feature words. In special, the proposed method not only serves to represent texts as graphs, but also constructs a structure on which the discrimination of senses is accomplished. Our results revealed that the proposed learning algorithm in such bipartite networks provides excellent results mostly when topical features are employed to characterize the context. Surprisingly, our method even outperformed the support vector machine algorithm in particular cases, with the advantage of being robust even if a small training dataset is available. Taken together, the results obtained here show that the proposed representation/classification method might be useful to improve the semantical characterization of written texts.

近年来，复杂网络的概念和方法被用来通过将单词表示消歧（WSD）任务表示为节点，如果它们在语义上是相似的，则将其连接起来。尽管使用这种模型进行的研究越来越多，但是他们中的大多数使用网络来表示数据，而在属性空间上执行的模式识别是使用传统的学习技术来执行的。换句话说，单词之间的结构关系在模式识别过程中还没有被明确地使用。此外，只有少数调查探讨了基于二分网络和图形（bigraphs）的表征对于问题的适用性，因为许多方法考虑了单词之间的所有可能的联系。在这种情况下，我们评估表示特征词（即表征上下文的词）和目标词（含糊不清）的二分网络模型的相关性，以解决书面文本中的歧义。在这里，我们重点关注这两种词语之间的语义关系，而不考虑特征词之间的关系。具体而言，所提出的方法不仅用于将文本表示为图形，而且还构建了对感官的辨别完成的结构。我们的研究结果表明，在这种双边网络中提出的学习算法提供了极好的结果，主要是当局部特征被用来表征上下文。令人惊讶的是，我们的方法甚至在特定情况下胜过支持向量机算法，即使有一个小的训练数据集可用，其优点是鲁棒的。综合起来，这里得到的结果表明，提出的代表/分类方法可能有助于改善书面文本的语义表征。
