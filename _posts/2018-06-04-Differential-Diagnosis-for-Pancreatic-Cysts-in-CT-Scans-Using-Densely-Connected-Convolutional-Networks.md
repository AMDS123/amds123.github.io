##### Abstract
The lethal nature of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) calls for early differential diagnosis of pancreatic cysts, which are identified in up to 16% of normal subjects, and some of which may develop into PDAC. Previous computer-aided developments have achieved certain accuracy for classification on segmented cystic lesions in CT. However, pancreatic cysts have a large variation in size and shape, and the precise segmentation of them remains rather challenging, which restricts the computer-aided interpretation of CT images acquired for differential diagnosis. We propose a computer-aided framework for early differential diagnosis of pancreatic cysts without pre-segmenting the lesions using densely-connected convolutional networks (Dense-Net). The Dense-Net learns high-level features from whole abnormal pancreas and builds mappings between medical imaging appearance to different pathological types of pancreatic cysts. To enhance the clinical applicability, we integrate saliency maps in the framework to assist the physicians to understand the decision of the deep learning method. The test on a cohort of 206 patients with 4 pathologically confirmed subtypes of pancreatic cysts has achieved an overall accuracy of 72.8%, which is significantly higher than the baseline accuracy of 48.1%, which strongly supports the clinical potential of our developed method.

胰腺导管腺癌（PDAC）的致死性质要求对早期鉴别诊断胰腺囊肿，其在正常受试者中高达16％确定，其中一些可能发展为PDAC。以前的计算机辅助开发已经在CT中分割出囊性病变的分类方面取得了一定的准确性。然而，胰腺囊肿在大小和形状上有很大的变化，并且它们的精确分割仍然相当具有挑战性，这限制了对于鉴别诊断所获得的CT图像的计算机辅助解释。我们提出了一个计算机辅助框架，用于胰腺囊肿的早期鉴别诊断，而不用使用密集连接的卷积网络（密集网络）预先分割病变。密集网从整个异常胰腺学习高级特征，并建立医学影像外观与不同病理类型胰腺囊肿之间的映射。为了提高临床适用性，我们在框架中整合了显着性图，以帮助医生理解深度学习方法的决定。对206例患有4种病理证实的胰腺囊肿的患者进行的一项队列试验的总体准确率为72.8％，明显高于48.1％的基线准确性，这有力地支持了我们开发的方法的临床潜力。
