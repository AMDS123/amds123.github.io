##### Abstract
Image segmentation in the medical domain is a challenging field owing to poor resolution and limited contrast. The predominantly used conventional segmentation techniques and the thresholding methods suffer from limitations because of heavy dependence on user interactions. Uncertainties prevalent in an image cannot be captured by these techniques. The performance further deteriorates when the images are corrupted by noise, outliers and other artifacts. The objective of this paper is to develop an effective robust fuzzy C- means clustering for segmenting vertebral body from magnetic resonance image owing to its unsupervised form of learning. The motivation for this work is detection of spine geometry and proper localisation and labelling will enhance the diagnostic output of a physician. The method is compared with Otsu thresholding and K-means clustering to illustrate the robustness.The reference standard for validation was the annotated images from the radiologist, and the Dice coefficient and Hausdorff distance measures were used to evaluate the segmentation.

由于分辨率差和对比度有限，医学领域的图像分割是一个具有挑战性的领域。主要使用的传统分割技术和阈值方法由于严重依赖于用户交互而受到限制。这些技术无法捕捉图像中普遍存在的不确定性。当图像被噪声，异常值和其他伪影破坏时，性能会进一步恶化。本文的目的是开发一种有效的鲁棒模糊C-均值聚类分割椎体从磁共振图像由于其无监督的形式学习。这项工作的动机是检测脊柱的几何形状，适当的定位和标签将增强医生的诊断输出。将该方法与Otsu阈值法和K均值聚类方法进行比较，说明该方法的鲁棒性。验证的参考标准是放射科医师的注释图像，并采用Dice系数和Hausdorff距离度量来评估分割。
