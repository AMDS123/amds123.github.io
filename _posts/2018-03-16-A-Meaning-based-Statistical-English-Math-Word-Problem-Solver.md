##### Abstract
We introduce MeSys, a meaning-based approach to solving English math word problems (MWPs) via understanding and reasoning in this paper. It first analyzes the text, transforms both body and question parts into their corresponding logic forms, and then performs inference on them. The associated context of each quantity is represented with proposed role-tags (e.g., nsubj, verb, etc.), which provides the flexibility for annotating an extracted math quantity with its associated context information (i.e., the physical meaning of this quantity). Statistical models are proposed to select the operator and operands. A noisy dataset is designed to assess if a solver solves MWPs mainly via understanding or pattern matching. Experimental results show that our approach outperforms existing systems on both benchmark datasets and the noisy dataset, which demonstrates that the proposed approach more understands the meaning of each quantity in the text.

我们介绍MeSys，这是一种基于意义的方法，通过本文的理解和推理来解决英语数学问题（MWPs）。它首先分析文本，将主体和问题部分转换为相应的逻辑形式，然后对它们进行推理。用提出的角色标签（例如，nsubj，动词等）来表示每个数量的相关联的上下文，其提供了用于提取数学量与其相关联的上下文信息（即，该数量的物理含义）的灵活性。提出统计模型来选择操作符和操作数。嘈杂的数据集旨在评估解算器是否主要通过理解或模式匹配来解决MWP。实验结果表明，我们的方法在基准数据集和噪声数据集上都优于现有系统，这表明所提出的方法更能理解文本中每个数量的含义。
