##### Abstract
A multiple instance dictionary learning method using functions of multiple instances (DL-FUMI) is proposed to address target detection and two-class classification problems with inaccurate training labels. Given inaccurate training labels, DL-FUMI learns a set of target dictionary atoms that describe the most distinctive and representative features of the true positive class as well as a set of nontarget dictionary atoms that account for the shared information found in both the positive and negative instances. Experimental results show that the estimated target dictionary atoms found by DL-FUMI are more representative prototypes and identify better discriminative features of the true positive class than existing methods in the literature. DL-FUMI is shown to have significantly better performance on several target detection and classification problems as compared to other multiple instance learning (MIL) dictionary learning algorithms on a variety of MIL problems.

提出了一种基于多实例函数的多实例词典学习方法（DL-FUMI），以解决目标检测和训练标注不准确的两类分类问题。鉴于不准确的训练标签，DL-FUMI学习了一组目标词典原子，这些原子描述了真正的正类的最独特的和代表性的特征，以及一组非目标字典原子，它们解释了在正面和负面实例。实验结果表明，DL-FUMI发现的估计目标字典原子是比较有代表性的原型，比文献中已有的方法识别出更好的判别特征。与其他多实例学习（MIL）字典学习算法相比，在各种MIL问题上，DL-FUMI在几个目标检测和分类问题上表现出明显更好的性能。
