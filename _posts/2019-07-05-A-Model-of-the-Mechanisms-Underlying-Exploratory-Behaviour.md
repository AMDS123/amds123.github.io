##### Abstract
A model of the mechanisms underlying exploratory behaviour, based on empirical research and refined using a computer simulation, is presented. The behaviour of killifish from two lakes, one with killifish predators and one without, was compared in the laboratory. Plotting average activity in a novel environment versus time resulted in an inverted-U-shaped curve for both groups; however, the curve for killifish from the lake without predators was (1) steeper, (2) reached a peak value earlier, (S) reached a higher peak value, and (4) subsumed less area than the curve for killifish from the lake with predators. We hypothesize that the shape of the exploration curve reflects a competition between motivational subsystems that excite and inhibit exploratory behaviour in a way that is tuned to match the affordance probabilities of the animal's environment. A computer implementation of this model produced curves which differed along the same four dimensions as differentiate the two killifish curves. All four differences were reproduced in the model by tuning a single parameter: the time-dependent component of the decay-rate of the exploration-inhibiting subsystem.
