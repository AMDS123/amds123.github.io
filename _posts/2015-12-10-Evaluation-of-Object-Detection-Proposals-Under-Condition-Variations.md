##### Abstract
Object detection is a fundamental task in many computer vision applications, therefore the importance of evaluating the quality of object detection is well acknowledged in this domain. This process gives insight into the capabilities of methods in handling environmental changes. In this paper, a new method for object detection is introduced that combines the Selective Search and EdgeBoxes. We tested these three methods under environmental variations. Our experiments demonstrate the outperformance of the combination method under illumination and view point variations.
