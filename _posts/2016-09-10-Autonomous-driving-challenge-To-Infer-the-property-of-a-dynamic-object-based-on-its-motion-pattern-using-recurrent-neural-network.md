##### Abstract
In autonomous driving applications a critical challenge is to identify action to take to avoid an obstacle on collision course. For example, when a heavy object is suddenly encountered it is critical to stop the vehicle or change the lane even if it causes other traffic disruptions. However,there are situations when it is preferable to collide with the object rather than take an action that would result in a much more serious accident than collision with the object. For example, a heavy object which falls from a truck should be avoided whereas a bouncing ball or a soft target such as a foam box need not be.We present a novel method to discriminate between the motion characteristics of these types of objects based on their physical properties such as bounciness, elasticity, etc.In this preliminary work, we use recurrent neural net-work with LSTM cells to train a classifier to classify objects based on their motion trajectories. We test the algorithm on synthetic data, and, as a proof of concept, demonstrate its effectiveness on a limited set of real-world data.

在自动驾驶应用中，一个关键的挑战是确定要采取的行动，以避免碰撞过程中的障碍。例如，当突然遇到重物时，即使造成其他交通中断，停车或更换车道也是至关重要的。然而，在某些情况下，最好是与物体发生碰撞，而不是采取可能导致比物体碰撞更严重的事故。例如，避免从卡车上掉落的重物，而不需要弹跳球或泡沫箱等软目标。我们提出了一种基于它们的区分这些类型物体的运动特性的新方法物理性质如弹性，弹性等。在这个前期工作中，我们使用递归神经网络与LSTM单元来训练分类器，以根据它们的运动轨迹对对象进行分类。我们在合成数据上测试算法，并且作为一个概念验证，在有限的实际数据集上展示其有效性。
