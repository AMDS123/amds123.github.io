##### Abstract
In this paper we report on a black-box approach to parallelize existing description logic (DL) reasoners for the Web Ontology Language (OWL). We focus on OWL ontology classification, which is an important inference service and supported by every major OWL/DL reasoner. We propose a flexible parallel framework which can be applied to existing OWL reasoners in order to speed up their classification process. In order to test its performance, we evaluated our framework by parallelizing major OWL reasoners for concept classification. In comparison to the selected black-box reasoner our results demonstrate that the wall clock time of ontology classification can be improved by one order of magnitude for most real-world ontologies.
