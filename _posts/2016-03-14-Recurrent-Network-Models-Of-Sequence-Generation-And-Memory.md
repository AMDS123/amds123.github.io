##### Abstract
Sequential activation of neurons is a common feature of network activity during a variety of behaviors, including working memory and decision making. Previous network models for sequences and memory emphasized specialized architectures in which a principled mechanism is pre-wired into their connectivity. Here we demonstrate that, starting from random connectivity and modifying a small fraction of connections, a largely disordered recur- rent network can produce sequences and implement working memory efficiently. We use this process, called Partial In-Network Training (PINning), to model and match cellular resolution imaging data from the posterior parietal cortex during a virtual memory- guided two-alternative forced-choice task. Analysis of the connectivity reveals that sequences propagate by the cooperation between recurrent synaptic interactions and external inputs, rather than through feedforward or asymmetric connections. Together our results suggest that neural sequences may emerge through learning from largely unstructured network architectures.

神经元的顺序激活是各种行为（包括工作记忆和决策制定）期间网络活动的共同特征。以前的序列和存储器网络模型强调了专门的架构，其中原理机制被预先连接到其连接。在这里，我们证明，从随机连接开始，修改一小部分连接，大部分无序的递归网络可以产生序列并有效地实现工作记忆。我们使用这个称为部分网络内训练（PINning）的过程来模拟和匹配来自后顶叶皮层的细胞分辨率成像数据，这是在虚拟记忆引导的双选择强迫选择任务期间进行的。对连接性的分析揭示了序列通过复发性突触相互作用和外部输入之间的合作而传播，而不是通过前馈或不对称连接。我们的结果一起表明，通过从大部分非结构化的网络架构学习，神经序列可能会出现。
