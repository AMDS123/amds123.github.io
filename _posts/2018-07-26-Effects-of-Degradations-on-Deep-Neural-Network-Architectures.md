##### Abstract
Deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have achieved many state-of-the-art results recently in different fields of computer vision. Different architectures are emerging almost everyday that produce fascinating results in machine vision tasks consisting million of images. Though CNN based models are able to detect and recognize large number of object classes, most of the times these models are trained with high quality images. Recently, an alternative architecture for image classification is proposed by Sabour et al. based on groups of neurons (capsules) and a novel dynamic routing protocol. The architecture has shown promising result by surpassing the performances of state-of-the-art CNN based models in some of the datasets. However, the behavior of capsule based models and CNN based models are largely unknown in presence of noise. As in most of the practical applications, it can not be guaranteed the input image is completely noise-free and does not contain any distortion, it is important to study the performance of these models under different noise conditions. In this paper, we select six widely used CNN architectures and consider their performances for image classification task for two different dataset under image quality distortions. We show that the capsule network is more robust to several image degradations than the CNN based models, especially for salt and pepper noise. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study on the performance of CapsuleNet and other state-of-the-art CNN architectures under different types of image degradations.

深度卷积神经网络（CNN）最近在计算机视觉的不同领域取得了许多最先进的结果。几乎每天都在出现不同的架构，这些架构在包含数百万张图像的机器视觉任务中产生了迷人的结果。虽然基于CNN的模型能够检测和识别大量对象类，但是大多数时候这些模型都使用高质量图像进行训练。最近，Sabour等人提出了一种用于图像分类的替代架构。基于神经元（胶囊）组和新颖的动态路由协议。该架构通过超越某些数据集中最先进的基于CNN的模型的性能而显示出有希望的结果。然而，在存在噪声的情况下，基于胶囊的模型和基于CNN的模型的行为在很大程度上是未知的。与大多数实际应用一样，不能保证输入图像完全无噪声且不包含任何失真，因此研究这些模型在不同噪声条件下的性能非常重要。在本文中，我们选择了六种广泛使用的CNN架构，并考虑它们在图像质量失真下对两种不同数据集的图像分类任务的性能。我们表明，与基于CNN的模型相比，胶囊网络对几种图像降级更加稳健，特别是对于盐和胡椒噪声。据我们所知，这是第一项关于CapsuleNet和其他最先进的CNN架构在不同类型图像质量下的性能的研究。
