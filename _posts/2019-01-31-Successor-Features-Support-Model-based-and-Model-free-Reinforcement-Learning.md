##### Abstract
One key challenge in reinforcement learning is the ability to generalize knowledge in control problems. While deep learning methods have been successfully combined with model-free reinforcement-learning algorithms, how to perform model-based reinforcement learning in the presence of approximation errors still remains an open problem. Using successor features, a feature representation that predicts a temporal constraint, this paper presents three contributions: First, it shows how learning successor features is equivalent to model-free learning. Then, it shows how successor features encode model reductions that compress the state space by creating state partitions of bisimilar states. Using this representation, an intelligent agent is guaranteed to accurately predict future reward outcomes, a key property of model-based reinforcement-learning algorithms. Lastly, it presents a loss objective and prediction error bounds showing that accurately predicting value functions and reward sequences is possible with an approximation of successor features. On finite control problems, we illustrate how minimizing this loss objective results in approximate bisimulations. The results presented in this paper provide a novel understanding of representations that can support model-free and model-based reinforcement learning.
