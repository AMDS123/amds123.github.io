##### Abstract
Advances in image super-resolution (SR) have recently benefited significantly from rapid developments in deep neural networks. Inspired by these recent discoveries, we note that many state-of-the-art deep SR architectures can be reformulated as a single-state recurrent neural network (RNN) with finite unfoldings. In this paper, we explore new structures for SR based on this compact RNN view, leading us to a dual-state design, the Dual-State Recurrent Network (DSRN). Compared to its single state counterparts that operate at a fixed spatial resolution, DSRN exploits both low-resolution (LR) and high-resolution (HR) signals jointly. Recurrent signals are exchanged between these states in both directions (both LR to HR and HR to LR) via delayed feedback. Extensive quantitative and qualitative evaluations on benchmark datasets and on a recent challenge demonstrate that the proposed DSRN performs favorably against state-of-the-art algorithms in terms of both memory consumption and predictive accuracy.

图像超分辨率（SR）方面的进步最近受益于深度神经网络的快速发展。受这些最近发现的启发，我们注意到许多最先进的深度SR架构可以重新配置为具有有限展开的单状态递归神经网络（RNN）。在本文中，我们基于这种紧凑的RNN视图探索了SR的新结构，使我们成为双状态设计 - 双状态回馈网络（DSRN）。与以固定空间分辨率运行的单一国家对应机构相比，DSRN共同利用低分辨率（LR）和高分辨率（HR）信号。经由延迟反馈在两个方向（LR至HR和HR至LR）在这些状态之间交换复发信号。对基准数据集和最近的挑战进行广泛的定量和定性评估表明，所提出的DSRN在内存消耗和预测准确性方面均表现出优异的性能，能够与最先进的算法相媲美。
