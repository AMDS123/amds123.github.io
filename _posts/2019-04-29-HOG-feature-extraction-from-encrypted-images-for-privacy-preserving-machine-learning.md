##### Abstract
In this paper, we propose an extraction method of HOG (histograms-of-oriented-gradients) features from encryption-then-compression (EtC) images for privacy-preserving machine learning, where EtC images are images encrypted by a block-based encryption method proposed for EtC systems with JPEG compression, and HOG is a feature descriptor used in computer vision for the purpose of object detection and image classification. Recently, cloud computing and machine learning have been spreading in many fields. However, the cloud computing has serious privacy issues for end users, due to unreliability of providers and some accidents. Accordingly, we propose a novel block-based extraction method of HOG features, and the proposed method enables us to carry out any machine learning algorithms without any influence, under some conditions. In an experiment, the proposed method is applied to a face image recognition problem under the use of two kinds of classifiers: linear support vector machine (SVM), gaussian SVM, to demonstrate the effectiveness.
