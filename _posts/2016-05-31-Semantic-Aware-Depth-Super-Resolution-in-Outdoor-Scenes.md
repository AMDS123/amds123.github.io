##### Abstract
While depth sensors are becoming increasingly popular, their spatial resolution often remains limited. Depth super-resolution therefore emerged as a solution to this problem. Despite much progress, state-of-the-art techniques suffer from two drawbacks: (i) they rely on the assumption that intensity edges coincide with depth discontinuities, which, unfortunately, is only true in controlled environments; and (ii) they typically exploit the availability of high-resolution training depth maps, which can often not be acquired in practice due to the sensors' limitations. By contrast, here, we introduce an approach to performing depth super-resolution in more challenging conditions, such as in outdoor scenes. To this end, we first propose to exploit semantic information to better constrain the super-resolution process. In particular, we design a co-sparse analysis model that learns filters from joint intensity, depth and semantic information. Furthermore, we show how low-resolution training depth maps can be employed in our learning strategy. We demonstrate the benefits of our approach over state-of-the-art depth super-resolution methods on two outdoor scene datasets.

深度传感器越来越受欢迎，但其空间分辨率往往受限。深度超分辨率因此成为解决这个问题的方法。尽管取得了很大的进步，但最先进的技术还是有两个缺点：（1）它们依赖于强度边缘与深度不连续性相一致的假设，不幸的是，在受控环境下才是真实的; （ii）它们通常利用高分辨率训练深度图的可用性，由于传感器的局限性，这在实践中通常是不可获得的。相反，在这里，我们介绍一种在更具挑战性的条件下进行深度超分辨率的方法，例如在户外场景中。为此，我们首先提出利用语义信息来更好地约束超解析过程。具体而言，我们设计了一个从联合强度，深度和语义信息中学习滤波器的共稀疏分析模型。此外，我们展示了如何在我们的学习策略中使用低分辨率训练深度图。我们在两个户外场景数据集上演示了我们的方法对于最先进的深度超分辨率方法的好处。
