##### Abstract
Most Arabic natural language processing tools and resources are developed to serve Modern Standard Arabic (MSA), which is the official written language in the Arab World. Some Dialectal Arabic varieties, notably Egyptian Arabic, have received some attention lately and have a growing collection of resources that include annotated corpora and morphological analyzers and taggers. Gulf Arabic, however, lags behind in that respect. In this paper, we present the Gumar Corpus, a large-scale corpus of Gulf Arabic consisting of 110 million words from 1,200 forum novels. We annotate the corpus for sub-dialect information at the document level. We also present results of a preliminary study in the morphological annotation of Gulf Arabic which includes developing guidelines for a conventional orthography. The text of the corpus is publicly browsable through a web interface we developed for it.

大多数阿拉伯语自然语言处理工具和资源都是为现代阿拉伯语标准（MSA）而开发的，这是阿拉伯世界的官方书面语言。一些阿拉伯语方言，特别是埃及阿拉伯语，最近受到了一些关注，并有越来越多的资源，包括注释语料库和形态分析器和标签。海湾阿拉伯语在这方面落后了。在这篇论文中，我们介绍了由1200本论坛小说中的1.1亿字组成的大型海湾阿拉伯语集“Gumar语料库”。我们在文档级注释语料库的子方言信息。我们还介绍了海湾阿拉伯语形态注释的初步研究结果，其中包括制定传统拼字法的指导原则。语料库的文本可以通过我们为它开发的Web界面公开浏览。
