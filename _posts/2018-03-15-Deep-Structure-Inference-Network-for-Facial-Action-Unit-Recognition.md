##### Abstract
Facial expressions are combinations of basic components called Action Units (AU). Recognizing AUs is key for developing general facial expression analysis. In recent years, most efforts in automatic AU recognition have been dedicated to learning combinations of local features and to exploiting correlations between Action Units. In this paper, we propose a deep neural architecture that tackles both problems by combining learned local and global features in its initial stages and replicating a message passing algorithm between classes similar to a graphical model inference approach in later stages. We show that by training the model end-to-end with increased supervision we improve state-of-the-art by 5.3\% and 8.2\% performance on BP4D and DISFA datasets, respectively.

面部表情是称为行动单位（AU）的基本组件的组合。识别AU是开发常规面部表情分析的关键。近年来，自动AU识别中的大部分努力致力于学习局部特征的组合，并利用动作单元之间的相关性。在本文中，我们提出了一种深度神经架构，它通过在初始阶段结合学习的局部和全局特征来解决这两个问题，并在类之间复制类似于后期阶段的图形模型推理方法的消息传递算法。我们证明，通过增加监督来端对端地训练模型，我们分别提高了BP4D和DISFA数据集的5.3％和8.2％的性能水平。
