##### Abstract
Deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) achieve remarkable performance on image classification tasks. Recent studies, however, have demonstrated that generalization abilities are more important than the depth of neural networks for improving performance on image classification tasks. Herein, a new neural network called SwGridNet is proposed. A SwGridNet includes many convolutional processing units which connect mutually as a grid network where many processing paths exist between input and output. A SwGridNet has high generalization capability because the multipath architecture has the same effect of ensemble learning. As described in this paper, details of the SwGridNet network architecture are presented. Experimentally obtained results presented in this paper show that SwGridNets respectively achieve test error rates of 2.95% and 15.67% in a CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 classification tasks. The results indicate that the SwGridNet performance approximates that of state-of-the-art deep CNNs.

深卷积神经网络（CNN）在图像分类任务上取得了卓越的性能。然而，最近的研究已经表明，泛化能力比神经网络的深度更重要，以提高图像分类任务的性能。在此，提出了一种称为SwGridNet的新型神经网络。 SwGridNet包含许多卷积处理单元，它们作为网格网络相互连接，其中在输入和输出之间存在许多处理路径。 SwGridNet具有较高的泛化能力，因为多路径架构具有相同的集成学习效果。如本文所述，介绍了SwGridNet网络体系结构的详细信息。本文提供的实验结果表明，在CIFAR-10和CIFAR-100分类任务中，SwGridNets分别达到了2.95％和15.67％的测试错误率。结果表明，SwGridNet性能接近于最先进的深度CNN。
