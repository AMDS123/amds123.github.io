##### Abstract
Video classification problem has been studied many years. The success of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) in image recognition tasks gives a powerful incentive for researchers to create more advanced video classification approaches. As video has a temporal content Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) networks become handy tool allowing to model long-term temporal clues. Both approaches need a large dataset of input data. In this paper three models provided to address video classification using recently announced YouTube-8M large-scale dataset. The first model is based on frame pooling approach. Two other models based on LSTM networks. Mixture of Experts intermediate layer is used in third model allowing to increase model capacity without dramatically increasing computations. The set of experiments for handling imbalanced training data has been conducted.

视频分类问题已经研究多年。卷积神经网络（CNN）在图像识别任务中的成功为研究人员提供了一个强大的激励机制，以创建更先进的视频分类方法。由于视频具有时态内容，长时短记忆（LSTM）网络成为允许模拟长期时间线索的便利工具。两种方法都需要大量的输入数据。本文提供了三种使用最近公布的YouTube-8M大型数据集来处理视频分类的模型。第一种模式是基于帧合并的方法。另外两个基于LSTM网络的模型。专家混合中间层用于第三个模型，允许增加模型容量，而不会显着增加计算量。已经进行了一套处理不平衡训练数据的实验。
