##### Abstract
Image classification is vulnerable to adversarial attacks. This work investigates the robustness of Saak transform against adversarial attacks towards high performance image classification. We develop a complete image classification system based on multi-stage Saak transform. In the Saak transform domain, clean and adversarial images demonstrate different distributions at different spectral dimensions. Selection of the spectral dimensions at every stage can be viewed as an automatic denoising process. Motivated by this observation, we carefully design strategies of feature extraction, representation and classification that increase adversarial robustness. The performances with well-known datasets and attacks are demonstrated by extensive experimental evaluations.
