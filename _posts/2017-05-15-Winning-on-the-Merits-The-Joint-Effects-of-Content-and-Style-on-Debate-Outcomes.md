##### Abstract
Debate and deliberation play essential roles in politics and government, but most models presume that debates are won mainly via superior style or agenda control. Ideally, however, debates would be won on the merits, as a function of which side has the stronger arguments. We propose a predictive model of debate that estimates the effects of linguistic features and the latent persuasive strengths of different topics, as well as the interactions between the two. Using a dataset of 118 Oxford-style debates, our model's combination of content (as latent topics) and style (as linguistic features) allows us to predict audience-adjudicated winners with 74% accuracy, significantly outperforming linguistic features alone (66%). Our model finds that winning sides employ stronger arguments, and allows us to identify the linguistic features associated with strong or weak arguments.

辩论和审议在政治和政府中发挥着至关重要的作用，但大多数模型认为辩论主要是通过优越的风格或议程控制获得的。然而，理想的情况下，辩论将取得胜利，作为哪一方有更强的论据的功能。我们提出了一个预测性的辩论模型，用来估计语言特征的影响以及不同话题的潜在说服力，以及两者之间的相互作用。使用118次牛津式辩论的数据集，我们的模型将内容（作为潜在主题）和风格（作为语言特征）进行组合，使我们能够以74％的准确率预测受众裁决的获胜者，显着优于单独的语言特征（66％）。我们的模型发现，胜利的双方使用更强的论据，并允许我们确定与强或弱论据相关的语言特征。
