##### Abstract
This article describes a software module called Akshara to Prosodeme (A2P) converter in Hindi. It converts an input grapheme into prosedeme (sequence of phonemes with the specification of syllable boundaries and prosodic labels). The software is based on two proposed finite state machines\textemdash one for the syllabification and another for the syllable labeling. In addition to that, it also uses a set of nonlinear phonological rules proposed for foot formation in Hindi, which encompass solutions to schwa-deletion in simple, compound, derived and inflected words. The nonlinear phonological rules are based on metrical phonology with the provision of recursive foot structure. A software module is implemented in Python. The testing of the software for syllabification, syllable labeling, schwa deletion and prosodic labeling yield an accuracy of more than 99% on a lexicon of size 28664 words.

本文介绍了一个名为Akshara的软件模块，用于印地语中的Prosodeme（A2P）转换器。它将输入的字形转化为起始点（音素序列，具有音节边界和韵律标签的说明）。该软件基于两个提出的有限状态机，一个用于音节化，另一个用于音节标记。除此之外，它还使用了一套非线性语音规则，用于印地语的脚步形成，包括简单，复合，派生词和变形词的schwa删除的解决方案。非线性语音规则是基于韵律音系学，提供递归脚结构。一个软件模块是用Python实现的。音节标记，schwa删除和韵律标注的软件测试对于28664字的词典产生超过99％的准确度。
