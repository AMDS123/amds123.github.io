##### Abstract
Within this thesis we propose a platform for combining Augmented Reality (AR) hardware with machine learning in a user-oriented pipeline, offering to the medical staff an intuitive 3D visualization of volumetric Computed Tomography (CT) and Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) medical image segmentations inside the AR headset, that does not need human intervention for loading, processing and segmentation of medical images. The AR visualization, based on Microsoft HoloLens, employs a modular and thus scalable frontend-backend architecture for real-time visualizations on multiple AR headsets. As Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have lastly demonstrated superior performance for the machine learning task of image semantic segmentation, the pipeline also includes a fully automated CNN algorithm for the segmentation of the liver from CT scans. The model is based on the Deep Retinal Image Understanding (DRIU) model which is a Fully Convolutional Network with side outputs from feature maps with different resolution, extracted at different stages of the network. The algorithm is 2.5D which means that the input is a set of consecutive scan slices. The experiments have been performed on the Liver Tumor Segmentation Challenge (LiTS) dataset for liver segmentation and demonstrated good results and flexibility. While multiple approaches exist in the domain, only few of them have focused on overcoming the practical aspects which still largely hold this technology away from the operating rooms. In line with this, we also are next planning an evaluation from medical doctors and radiologists in a real-world environment.

##### Abstract (translated by Google)
在本论文中，我们提出了一个平台，用于将增强现实（AR）硬件与机器学习结合在一个面向用户的管道中，为医务人员提供体积计算机断层扫描（CT）和磁共振成像（MRI）医学图像的直观三维可视化。 AR耳机内部的分段，不需要人工干预来加载，处理和分割医学图像。基于Microsoft HoloLens的AR可视化采用模块化且可扩展的前端后端架构，可在多个AR耳机上实时可视化。由于卷积神经网络（CNN）最终证明了图像语义分割的机器学习任务的优越性能，该管道还包括用于从CT扫描分割肝脏的全自动CNN算法。该模型基于深度视网膜图像理解（DRIU）模型，该模型是完全卷积网络，具有来自具有不同分辨率的特征图的侧输出，在网络的不同阶段提取。该算法是2.5D，这意味着输入是一组连续的扫描切片。已经对肝肿瘤分割挑战（LiTS）肝脏分割数据集进行了实验，并证明了良好的结果和灵活性。虽然该领域存在多种方法，但只有少数方法专注于克服实际方面，这些方面仍然主要使该技术远离手术室。与此一致，我们接下来还计划在现实环境中对医生和放射科医师进行评估。
