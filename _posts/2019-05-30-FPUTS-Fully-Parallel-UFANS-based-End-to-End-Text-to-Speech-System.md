##### Abstract
A Text-to-speech (TTS) system that can generate high quality audios with small time latency and fewer errors is required for industrial applications and services. In this paper, we propose a new non-autoregressive, fully parallel end-to-end TTS system. It utilizes the new attention structure and the recently proposed convolutional structure, UFANS. Different to RNN, UFANS can capture long term information in a fully parallel manner. Compared with the most popular end-to-end text-to-speech systems, our system can generate equal or better quality audios with fewer errors and reach at least 10 times speed up of inference.
