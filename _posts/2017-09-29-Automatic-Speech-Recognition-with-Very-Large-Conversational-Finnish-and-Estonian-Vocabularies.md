##### Abstract
Today, the vocabulary size for language models in large vocabulary speech recognition is typically several hundreds of thousands of words. While this is already sufficient in some applications, the out-of-vocabulary words are still limiting the usability in others. In agglutinative languages the vocabulary for conversational speech should include millions of word forms to cover the spelling variations due to colloquial pronunciations, in addition to the word compounding and inflections. Very large vocabularies are also needed, for example, when the recognition of rare proper names is important.

##### Abstract (translated by Google)
今天，大词汇量语音识别中的语言模型的词汇量通常是几十万字。虽然这在某些应用中已经足够了，但是词汇外的词语仍然限制了其他语言的可用性。在凝聚式语言中，对话式发音的词汇应该包括数百万个单词形式，以涵盖由于口语发音而引起的拼写变化，以及复合词和变形词。例如，当识别罕见的专有名词很重要时，也需要非常大的词汇表。
