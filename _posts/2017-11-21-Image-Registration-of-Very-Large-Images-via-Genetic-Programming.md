##### Abstract
Image registration (IR) is a fundamental task in image processing for matching two or more images of the same scene taken at different times, from different viewpoints and/or by different sensors. Due to the enormous diversity of IR applications, automatic IR remains a challenging problem to this day. A wide range of techniques has been developed for various data types and problems. However, they might not handle effectively very large images, which give rise usually to more complex transformations, e.g., deformations and various other distortions. In this paper we present a genetic programming (GP)-based approach for IR, which could offer a significant advantage in dealing with very large images, as it does not make any prior assumptions about the transformation model. Thus, by incorporating certain generic building blocks into the proposed GP framework, we hope to realize a large set of specialized transformations that should yield accurate registration of very large images.

图像配准（IR）是图像处理中的基本任务，用于匹配来自不同视点和/或不同传感器的在不同时间拍摄的相同场景的两个或更多个图像。由于IR应用的巨大多样性，自动IR仍然是当今具有挑战性的问题。针对各种数据类型和问题已经开发了各种各样的技术。然而，它们可能无法处理非常大的图像，这通常会导致更复杂的转换，例如变形和各种其他的扭曲。在本文中，我们提出了一种基于遗传编程（IR）的IR方法，它可以在处理超大图像时提供显着的优势，因为它不会对转换模型作出任何先验假设。因此，通过将某些通用构建模块纳入到提出的GP框架中，我们希望实现一系列专门的转换，这些转换能够产生准确的大图像配准。
