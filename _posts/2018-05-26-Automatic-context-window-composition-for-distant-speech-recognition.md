##### Abstract
Distant speech recognition is being revolutionized by deep learning, that has contributed to significantly outperform previous HMM-GMM systems. A key aspect behind the rapid rise and success of DNNs is their ability to better manage large time contexts. With this regard, asymmetric context windows that embed more past than future frames have been recently used with feed-forward neural networks. This context configuration turns out to be useful not only to address low-latency speech recognition, but also to boost the recognition performance under reverberant conditions. This paper investigates on the mechanisms occurring inside DNNs, which lead to an effective application of asymmetric contexts.In particular, we propose a novel method for automatic context window composition based on a gradient analysis. The experiments, performed with different acoustic environments, features, DNN architectures, microphone settings, and recognition tasks show that our simple and efficient strategy leads to a less redundant frame configuration, which makes DNN training more effective in reverberant scenarios.

远程语音识别正在通过深度学习而发生革命性变化，这有助于显着超越以前的HMM-GMM系统。 DNN迅速崛起和成功背后的一个关键因素是他们能够更好地管理大型时间背景。在这方面，嵌入比未来帧更多的不对称上下文窗口最近已经用于前馈神经网络。这种上下文配置不仅有助于解决低延迟语音识别问题，而且在混响条件下提高识别性能也很有用。本文研究了DNN内部发生的机制，导致了非对称情境的有效应用。特别是，我们提出了一种基于梯度分析的自动上下文窗口合成新方法。通过不同的声学环境，功能，DNN体系结构，麦克风设置和识别任务执行的实验表明，我们简单高效的策略导致冗余帧配置更少，这使得DNN训练在混响场景中更加有效。
