##### Abstract
Entity search is a new application meeting either precise or vague requirements from the search engines users. Baidu Cup 2016 Challenge just provided such a chance to tackle the problem of the entity search. We achieved the first place with the average MAP scores on 4 tasks including movie, tvShow, celebrity and restaurant. In this paper, we propose a series of similarity features based on both of the word frequency features and the word semantic features and describe our ranking architecture and experiment details.
