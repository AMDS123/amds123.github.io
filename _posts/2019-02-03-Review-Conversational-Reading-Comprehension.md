##### Abstract
Seeking information about products and services is an important activity of online consumers before making a purchase decision. Inspired by recent research on conversational reading comprehension (CRC) on formal documents, this paper studies the task of leveraging knowledge from a huge amount of reviews to answer multi-turn questions from consumers or users. Questions spanning multiple turns in a dialogue enables users to ask more specific questions that are hard to ask within a single question as in traditional machine reading comprehension (MRC). In this paper, we first build a dataset and then propose a novel task-adaptation approach to encoding the formulation of CRC task into a pre-trained language model. This task-adaptation approach is unsupervised and can greatly enhance the performance of the end CRC task that has only limited supervision. Experimental results show that the proposed approach is highly effective and has competitive performance as supervised approach. We plan to release the datasets and the code in May 2019.
