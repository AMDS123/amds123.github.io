##### Abstract
We present a joint modeling approach to identify salient discussion points in spoken meetings as well as to label the discourse relations between speaker turns. A variation of our model is also discussed when discourse relations are treated as latent variables. Experimental results on two popular meeting corpora show that our joint model can outperform state-of-the-art approaches for both phrase-based content selection and discourse relation prediction tasks. We also evaluate our model on predicting the consistency among team members' understanding of their group decisions. Classifiers trained with features constructed from our model achieve significant better predictive performance than the state-of-the-art.

我们提出了一个联合建模方法，以确定在口头会议中突出的讨论点，以及标签话轮之间的话语关系。当话语关系被视为潜变量时，我们的模型的一个变体也被讨论。两个流行的会议语料库的实验结果表明，我们的联合模型可以超越基于短语的内容选择和话语关系预测任务的最新方法。我们还评估我们的模型，预测团队成员对团队决策的理解一致性。用我们的模型构造的特征训练的分类器比现有技术具有更好的预测性能。
