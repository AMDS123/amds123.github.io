##### Abstract
Human-Object Interaction (HOI) Detection is an important problem to understand how humans interact with objects. In this paper, we explore Interactiveness Prior which indicates whether human and object interact with each other or not. We found that interactiveness prior can be learned across HOI datasets, regardless of HOI category settings. Our core idea is to exploit an Interactiveness Network to learn the general interactiveness prior from multiple HOI datasets and perform Non-Interaction Suppression before HOI classification in inference. On account of the generalization of interactiveness prior, interactiveness network is a transferable knowledge learner and can be cooperated with any HOI detection models to achieve desirable results. We extensively evaluate the proposed method on HICO-DET and V-COCO datasets. Our framework outperforms state-of-the-art HOI detection results by a great margin, verifying its efficacy and flexibility. Source codes and models will be made publicly available.
