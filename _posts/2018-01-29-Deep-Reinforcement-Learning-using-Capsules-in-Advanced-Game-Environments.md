##### Abstract
Reinforcement Learning (RL) is a research area that has blossomed tremendously in recent years and has shown remarkable potential for artificial intelligence based opponents in computer games. This success is primarily due to vast capabilities of Convolutional Neural Networks (ConvNet), enabling algorithms to extract useful information from noisy environments. Capsule Network (CapsNet) is a recent introduction to the Deep Learning algorithm group and has only barely begun to be explored. The network is an architecture for image classification, with superior performance for classification of the MNIST dataset. CapsNets have not been explored beyond image classification. 
 This thesis introduces the use of CapsNet for Q-Learning based game algorithms. To successfully apply CapsNet in advanced game play, three main contributions follow. First, the introduction of four new game environments as frameworks for RL research with increasing complexity, namely Flash RL, Deep Line Wars, Deep RTS, and Deep Maze. These environments fill the gap between relatively simple and more complex game environments available for RL research and are in the thesis used to test and explore the CapsNet behavior. 
 Second, the thesis introduces a generative modeling approach to produce artificial training data for use in Deep Learning models including CapsNets. We empirically show that conditional generative modeling can successfully generate game data of sufficient quality to train a Deep Q-Network well. 
 Third, we show that CapsNet is a reliable architecture for Deep Q-Learning based algorithms for game AI. A capsule is a group of neurons that determine the presence of objects in the data and is in the literature shown to increase the robustness of training and predictions while lowering the amount training data needed. It should, therefore, be ideally suited for game plays.

强化学习（RL）是近年来蓬勃发展的一个研究领域，在计算机游戏领域，以对手为基础的人工智能显示出了巨大的潜力。这一成功主要归功于卷积神经网络（ConvNet）的广泛功能，使得算法能够从嘈杂的环境中提取有用的信息。 Capsule网络（CapsNet）是深度学习算法小组的一个最新的介绍，并且只是刚刚开始探索。网络是图像分类的一种架构，对于MNIST数据集的分类具有优越的性能。 CapsNets并没有被探索超越图像分类。
 本文介绍了基于Q-Learning的游戏算法CapsNet的使用。为了成功将CapsNet应用于高级游戏，接下来有三个主要贡献。首先，引入四种新的游戏环境作为RL研究的框架，并且越来越复杂，即Flash RL，Deep Line Wars，Deep RTS和Deep Maze。这些环境填补了用于RL研究的相对简单和更复杂的游戏环境之间的空白，并且用于测试和探索CapsNet行为。
 其次，本文介绍了一种生成建模方法来生成包括CapsNets在内的深度学习模型的人工训练数据。我们经验地表明，有条件的生成建模可以成功地生成足够质量的游戏数据，以很好地训练Deep Q-Network。
 第三，我们展示了CapsNet是一个基于深度Q学习的游戏AI算法的可靠架构。胶囊是确定数据中物体的存在的一组神经元，并且在文献中显示为增加训练和预测的稳健性，同时降低所需的训练数据量。因此，它应该非常适合玩游戏。
