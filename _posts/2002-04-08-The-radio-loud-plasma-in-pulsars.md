##### Abstract
The pulsar magnetosphere contains a strongly magnetized, relativistic plasma. We need to understand the physics of that plasma if we want to connect the data to the models. Our group in Socorro is mixing theory and observations in order to study the radio-loud pulsar plasma. In this paper we report on several aspects of our current work.
