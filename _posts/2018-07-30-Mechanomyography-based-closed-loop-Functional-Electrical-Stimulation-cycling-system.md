##### Abstract
Functional Electrical Stimulation (FES) systems are successful in restoring motor function and supporting paralyzed users. Commercially available FES products are open loop, meaning that the system is unable to adapt to changing conditions with the user and their muscles which results in muscle fatigue and poor stimulation protocols. This is because it is difficult to close the loop between stimulation and monitoring of muscle contraction using adaptive stimulation. FES causes electrical artefacts which make it challenging to monitor muscle contractions with traditional methods such as electromyography (EMG). We look to overcome this limitation by combining FES with novel mechanomyographic (MMG) sensors to be able to monitor muscle activity during stimulation in real time. To provide a meaningful task we built an FES cycling rig with a software interface that enabled us to perform adaptive recording and stimulation, and then combine this with sensors to record forces applied to the pedals using force sensitive resistors (FSRs), crank angle position using a magnetic incremental encoder and inputs from the user using switches and a potentiometer. We illustrated this with a closed-loop stimulation algorithm that used the inputs from the sensors to control the output of a programmable RehaStim 1 FES stimulator (Hasomed) in real-time. This recumbent bicycle rig was used as a testing platform for FES cycling. The algorithm was designed to respond to a change in requested speed (RPM) from the user and change the stimulation power (% of maximum current mA) until this speed was achieved and then maintain it.

功能性电刺激（FES）系统成功地恢复了运动功能并支持瘫痪的用户。商业上可获得的FES产品是开环的，这意味着该系统不能适应用户及其肌肉的变化条件，这导致肌肉疲劳和不良的刺激方案。这是因为难以使用适应性刺激来闭合刺激和监测肌肉收缩之间的环路。 FES导致电气伪影，这使得用肌电图（EMG）等传统方法监测肌肉收缩具有挑战性。我们希望通过将FES与新型肌电图（MMG）传感器相结合来克服这一限制，以便能够实时监测刺激期间的肌肉活动。为了提供有意义的任务，我们建立了一个FES自行车装备，其软件界面使我们能够执行自适应记录和刺激，然后将其与传感器结合使用力敏电阻（FSR）记录施加在踏板上的力，使用曲柄角位置磁增量编码器和用户使用开关和电位计输入。我们用闭环刺激算法说明了这一点，该算法利用传感器的输入实时控制可编程RehaStim 1 FES刺激器（Hasomed）的输出。这种斜躺式自行车钻机被用作FES自行车的测试平台。该算法被设计成响应来自用户的请求速度（RPM）的变化并且改变刺激功率（最大电流mA的％）直到达到该速度然后维持它。
