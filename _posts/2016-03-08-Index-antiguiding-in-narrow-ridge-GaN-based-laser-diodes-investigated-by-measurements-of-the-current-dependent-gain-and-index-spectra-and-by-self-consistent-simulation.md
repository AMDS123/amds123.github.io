##### Abstract
The threshold current density of narrow (1.5 {\mu}m) ridge-waveguide InGaN multi-quantum-well laser diodes, as well as the shape of their lateral far-field patterns, strongly depend on the etch depth of the ridge waveguide. Both effects can be attributed to strong index-antiguiding. A value of the antiguiding factor R = 10 is experimentally determined near threshold by measurements of the current-dependent gain and refractive index spectra. The device performances are simulated self-consistently solving the Schr\"odinger-Poisson equations and the equations for charge transport and waveguiding. Assuming a carrier-induced index change which matches the experimentally determined antiguiding factor, both the measured high threshold current and the shape of the far-field pattern of lasers with shallow ridges can be reproduced theoretically.

窄（1.5μs）脊形波导InGaN多量子阱激光二极管的阈值电流密度以及其横向远场图案的形状强烈依赖于脊形波导的刻蚀深度。这两个影响可以归因于强大的指数 - 反导。通过测量电流依赖的增益和折射率光谱，通过实验确定反引导因子R = 10的值。设备性能模拟自洽地求解薛定谔泊松方程和电荷传输和波导方程，假设载流子诱导的指数变化与实验确定的反导因素相匹配，测得的高阈值电流和形状可以在理论上复制具有浅脊的激光器的远场图案。
