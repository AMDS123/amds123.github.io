##### Abstract
In order to solve complex, long-horizon tasks, intelligent robots need to be able to carry out high-level, abstract planning and reasoning in conjunction with motion planning. However, abstract models are typically lossy and plans or policies computed using them are often unexecutable in practice. These problems are aggravated in more realistic situations with stochastic dynamics, where the robot needs to reason about, and plan for multiple possible contingencies. We present a new approach for integrated task and motion planning in such settings. In contrast to prior work in this direction, we show that our approach can effectively compute integrated task and motion policies with branching structure encoding agent behaviors for various possible contingencies. We prove that our algorithm is probabilistically complete and can compute feasible solution policies in an anytime fashion so that the probability of encountering an unresolved contingency decreases over time. Empirical results on a set of challenging problems show the utility and scope of our methods.
