##### Abstract
A large number of different feature detectors has been proposed so far. Any existing approach presents strengths and weaknesses, which make a detector optimal only for a limited range of applications. A tool capable of selecting the optimal feature detector in relation to the operating conditions is presented in this paper. The input images are quickly analyzed to determine what type of image transformation is applied to them and at which amount. Finally, the detector that is expected to obtain the highest repeatability under such conditions, is chosen to extract features from the input images. The efficiency and the good accuracy in determining the optimal feature detector for any operating condition, make the proposed tool suitable to be utilized in real visual applications. %A large number of different feature detectors has been proposed so far. Any existing approach presents strengths and weaknesses, which make a detector optimal only for a limited range of applications. A large number of different local feature detectors have been proposed in the last few years. However, each feature detector has its own strengths ad weaknesses that limit its use to a specific range of applications. In this paper is presented a tool capable of quickly analysing input images to determine which type and amount of transformation is applied to them and then selecting the optimal feature detector, which is expected to perform the best. The results show that the performance and the fast execution time render the proposed tool suitable for real-world vision applications.

目前已经提出了大量不同的特征检测器。任何现有的方法都存在优点和缺点，这使得检测器仅适用于有限范围的应用。本文介绍了一种能够根据操作条件选择最佳特征检测器的工具。输入图像被快速分析，以确定哪种类型的图像转换被应用到他们和在哪个数量。最后，选择预期在这种条件下获得最高可重复性的检测器以从输入图像中提取特征。在任何操作条件下确定最优特征检测器的效率和精确度使得所提出的工具适合用于实际的视觉应用。 ％迄今为止，已经提出了大量不同的特征检测器。任何现有的方法都存在优点和缺点，这使得检测器仅适用于有限范围的应用。近几年来已经提出了大量不同的局部特征探测器。但是，每个特征检测器都有其自身的优势和劣势，将其用于特定的应用范围。在本文中提出了一种工具，能够快速分析输入图像，以确定哪种类型和数量的变换应用到他们，然后选择最佳的特征检测器，预计执行最好的。结果表明，性能和快速的执行时间使得所提出的工具适合于真实世界的视觉应用。
