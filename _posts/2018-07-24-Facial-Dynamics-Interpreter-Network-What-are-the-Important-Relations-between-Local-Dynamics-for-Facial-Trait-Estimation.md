##### Abstract
Human face analysis is an important task in computer vision. According to cognitive-psychological studies, facial dynamics could provide crucial cues for face analysis. The motion of a facial local region in facial expression is related to the motion of other facial local regions. In this paper, a novel deep learning approach, named facial dynamics interpreter network, has been proposed to interpret the important relations between local dynamics for estimating facial traits from expression sequence. The facial dynamics interpreter network is designed to be able to encode a relational importance, which is used for interpreting the relation between facial local dynamics and estimating facial traits. By comparative experiments, the effectiveness of the proposed method has been verified. The important relations between facial local dynamics are investigated by the proposed facial dynamics interpreter network in gender classification and age estimation. Moreover, experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in gender classification and age estimation.

人脸分析是计算机视觉中的一项重要任务。根据认知心理学研究，面部动力学可以为面部分析提供重要线索。面部表情中面部局部区域的运动与其他面部局部区域的运动有关。本文提出了一种新的深度学习方法 - 面部动态解释网络 - 来解释从表达序列估计面部特征的局部动态之间的重要关系。面部动态解释器网络被设计为能够编码关系重要性，其用于解释面部局部动态和估计面部特征之间的关系。通过对比实验，验证了该方法的有效性。通过提出的面部动态解释器网络在性别分类和年龄估计中研究面部局部动力学之间的重要关系。此外，实验结果表明，该方法在性别分类和年龄估计方面优于最先进的方法。
