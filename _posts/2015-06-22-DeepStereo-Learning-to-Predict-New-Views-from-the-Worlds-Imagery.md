##### Abstract
Deep networks have recently enjoyed enormous success when applied to recognition and classification problems in computer vision, but their use in graphics problems has been limited. In this work, we present a novel deep architecture that performs new view synthesis directly from pixels, trained from a large number of posed image sets. In contrast to traditional approaches which consist of multiple complex stages of processing, each of which require careful tuning and can fail in unexpected ways, our system is trained end-to-end. The pixels from neighboring views of a scene are presented to the network which then directly produces the pixels of the unseen view. The benefits of our approach include generality (we only require posed image sets and can easily apply our method to different domains), and high quality results on traditionally difficult scenes. We believe this is due to the end-to-end nature of our system which is able to plausibly generate pixels according to color, depth, and texture priors learnt automatically from the training data. To verify our method we show that it can convincingly reproduce known test views from nearby imagery. Additionally we show images rendered from novel viewpoints. To our knowledge, our work is the first to apply deep learning to the problem of new view synthesis from sets of real-world, natural imagery.

深度网络最近在应用于计算机视觉中的识别和分类问题方面取得了巨大的成功，但是它们在图形问题上的使用受到限制。在这项工作中，我们提出了一个新的深层架构，直接从像素进行新的视图合成，从大量的姿态图像集训练。与由多个复杂的处理阶段组成的传统方法相比，每个方法都需要仔细的调整，并且可能以意想不到的方式失败，我们的系统是端到端的培训。来自场景的相邻视图的像素被呈现给网络，然后网络直接产生不可见视图的像素。我们的方法的好处包括普遍性（我们只需要提出的图像集，并可以轻松地将我们的方法应用于不同的领域），并在传统困难的场景高质量的结果。我们相信这是由于我们的系统的端到端特性，它能够根据从训练数据自动学习的颜色，深度和纹理先验来合理地生成像素。为了验证我们的方法，我们证明它可以令人信服地从附近的图像复制已知的测试视图。此外，我们显示从新颖的观点呈现的图像。就我们所知，我们的工作是第一个将深度学习应用于现实世界，自然意象集合的新视角综合问题。
