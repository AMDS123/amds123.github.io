##### Abstract
We report on electrostatic screening of polarization-induced internal electric fields in AlN/GaN nanowire heterostructures with Germanium-doped GaN nanodiscs embedded between AlN barriers. The incorporation of Germanium at concentrations above $10^{20}\,\text{cm}^{-3}$ shifts the photoluminescence emission energy of GaN nanodiscs to higher energies accompanied by a decrease of the photoluminescence decay time. At the same time, the thickness-dependent shift in emission energy is significantly reduced. In spite of the high donor concentration a degradation of the photoluminescence properties is not observed.
