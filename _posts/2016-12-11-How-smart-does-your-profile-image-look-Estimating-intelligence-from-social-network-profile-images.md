##### Abstract
Profile images on social networks are users' opportunity to present themselves and to affect how others judge them. We examine what Facebook images say about users' perceived and measured intelligence. 1,122 Facebook users completed a matrices intelligence test and shared their current Facebook profile image. Strangers also rated the images for perceived intelligence. We use automatically extracted image features to predict both measured and perceived intelligence. Intelligence estimation from images is a difficult task even for humans, but experimental results show that human accuracy can be equalled using computing methods. We report the image features that predict both measured and perceived intelligence, and highlight misleading features such as "smiling" and "wearing glasses" that are correlated with perceived but not measured intelligence. Our results give insights into inaccurate stereotyping from profile images and also have implications for privacy, especially since in most social networks profile images are public by default.

社交网络上的个人资料图像是用户展现自我和影响他人如何评判他们的机会。我们研究一下Facebook的图片对用户感知和测量的情报的看法。 1,122名Facebook用户完成了矩阵智能测试，并分享了他们当前的Facebook个人资料图片。陌生人也对感知的情报进行评分。我们使用自动提取的图像特征来预测测量和感知智能。即使对于人类来说，从图像中进行智能估计也是一项艰巨的任务，但是实验结果表明，使用计算方法可以使人类的准确性相等。我们报告预测测量和感知智能的图像特征，并突出显示误导的特征，例如与感知但未测量的智能相关的“微笑”和“戴眼镜”。我们的研究结果让人们对来自个人资料图片的不准确的定型观念产生了洞察力，同时也对隐私产生了影响，特别是在大多数社交网络中，个人资料图片默认为公开。
