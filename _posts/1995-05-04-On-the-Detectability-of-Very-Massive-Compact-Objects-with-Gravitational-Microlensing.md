##### Abstract
If the dark halo of our galaxy is made of compact objects as massive as M = 10^6 solar masses, their detection by means of ordinary microlensing searches would take a very long time as the characteristic time scale of such a lensing event, t_0, is approximately 200 years. Fortunately, the very high magnification events of the numerous faint stars, which are normally well below the detection threshold, have short duration peaks with a characteristic time scale of only t_0 / A_{max}, where A_{max} >> 1 is the peak magnification factor. The two almost equally bright images are separated by approximately 2'' (M/10^6 solar masses )^{1/2}, and they rotate very rapidly around the lens with the relative proper motion enhanced by a factor 2 A_{max}. The same events will offer an opportunity to study spectroscopically stars which are normally far too faint to be reached.

如果我们的银河系的黑暗光环是由太阳质量为M = 10 ^ 6的紧凑物体制成的，那么它们通过普通微透镜搜​​索的检测将花费很长时间作为这种透镜事件的特征时间尺度t_0，大约是200年。幸运的是，通常远低于检测阈值的许多微弱星体的高倍放大事件具有持续时间短的峰值，其特征时标仅为t_0 / A_ {max}，其中A_ {max} >> 1是峰值放大倍数。两个几乎同样明亮的图像被大约2“（M / 10 ^ 6太阳质量）^ {1/2}分开，并且它们围绕镜头非常快速地旋转，相对自适应运动增强了2 A_ {max }。同样的事件将提供一个机会来研究通常太微弱的光谱学恒星。
