##### Abstract
Modern AI and robotic systems are characterized by a high and ever-increasing level of autonomy. At the same time, their applications in fields such as autonomous driving, service robotics and digital personal assistants move closer to humans. From the combination of both developments emerges the field of AI ethics which recognizes that the actions of autonomous machines entail moral dimensions and tries to answer the question of how we can build moral machines. In this paper we argue for taking inspiration from Aristotelian virtue ethics by showing that it forms a suitable combination with modern AI due to its focus on learning from experience. We furthermore propose that imitation learning from moral exemplars, a central concept in virtue ethics, can solve the value alignment problem. Finally, we show that an intelligent system endowed with the virtues of temperance and friendship to humans would not pose a control problem as it would not have the desire for limitless self-improvement.

##### Abstract (translated by Google)
现代人工智能和机器人系统的特点是高度和不断增加的自治水平。与此同时，他们在自动驾驶，服务机器人和数字私人助理等领域的应用也向人类靠拢。从这两种发展的结合出现了AI道德领域，它认识到自主机器的行为需要道德维度，并试图回答我们如何构建道德机器的问题。在本文中，我们主张从亚里士多德的美德伦理中获得灵感，表现出它与现代人工智能形成了一个适合的组合，因为它专注于从经验中学习。我们进一步提出，从德性伦理的核心概念 - 道德范例模仿学习可以解决价值对准问题。最后，我们证明，赋予人类节制和友谊美德的智能系统不会造成控制问题，因为它不会有无限的自我完善的愿望。
