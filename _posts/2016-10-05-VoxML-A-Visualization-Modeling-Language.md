##### Abstract
We present the specification for a modeling language, VoxML, which encodes semantic knowledge of real-world objects represented as three-dimensional models, and of events and attributes related to and enacted over these objects. VoxML is intended to overcome the limitations of existing 3D visual markup languages by allowing for the encoding of a broad range of semantic knowledge that can be exploited by a variety of systems and platforms, leading to multimodal simulations of real-world scenarios using conceptual objects that represent their semantic values.

##### Abstract (translated by Google)
我们提出了建模语言VoxML的规范，该规范对表示为三维模型的真实世界对象的语义知识以及与这些对象有关的事件和属性进行编码。 VoxML旨在克服现有3D视觉标记语言的局限性，允许对各种系统和平台可以利用的广泛的语义知识进行编码，从而导致使用概念对象的多模态真实世界场景代表他们的语义价值。
