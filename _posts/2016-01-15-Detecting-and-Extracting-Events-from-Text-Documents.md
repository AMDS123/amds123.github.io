##### Abstract
Events of various kinds are mentioned and discussed in text documents, whether they are books, news articles, blogs or microblog feeds. The paper starts by giving an overview of how events are treated in linguistics and philosophy. We follow this discussion by surveying how events and associated information are handled in computationally. In particular, we look at how textual documents can be mined to extract events and ancillary information. These days, it is mostly through the application of various machine learning techniques. We also discuss applications of event detection and extraction systems, particularly in summarization, in the medical domain and in the context of Twitter posts. We end the paper with a discussion of challenges and future directions.

无论是书籍，新闻文章，博客还是微博，文本文档都会提到和讨论各种各样的事件。本文首先概述了语言学和哲学如何对待事件。我们通过调查计算如何处理事件和相关信息来跟踪这个讨论。特别是，我们看看如何挖掘文本文档来提取事件和辅助信息。这些天，主要是通过各种机器学习技术的应用。我们还讨论了事件检测和提取系统的应用，特别是在总结中，在医疗领域和Twitter帖子的上下文中。我们结束本文讨论挑战和未来的方向。
