##### Abstract
In this paper we address the problem of multi-cue affect recognition in challenging environments such as child-robot interaction. Towards this goal we propose a method for automatic recognition of affect that leverages body expressions alongside facial expressions, as opposed to traditional methods that usually focus only on the latter. We evaluate our methods on a challenging child-robot interaction database of emotional expressions, as well as on a database of emotional expressions by actors, and show that the proposed method achieves significantly better results when compared with the facial expression baselines, can be trained both jointly and separately, and offers us computational models for both the individual modalities, as well as for the whole body emotion.
