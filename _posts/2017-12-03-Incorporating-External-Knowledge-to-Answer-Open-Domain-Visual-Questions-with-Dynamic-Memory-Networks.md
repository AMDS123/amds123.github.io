##### Abstract
Visual Question Answering (VQA) has attracted much attention since it offers insight into the relationships between the multi-modal analysis of images and natural language. Most of the current algorithms are incapable of answering open-domain questions that require to perform reasoning beyond the image contents. To address this issue, we propose a novel framework which endows the model capabilities in answering more complex questions by leveraging massive external knowledge with dynamic memory networks. Specifically, the questions along with the corresponding images trigger a process to retrieve the relevant information in external knowledge bases, which are embedded into a continuous vector space by preserving the entity-relation structures. Afterwards, we employ dynamic memory networks to attend to the large body of facts in the knowledge graph and images, and then perform reasoning over these facts to generate corresponding answers. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our model not only achieves the state-of-the-art performance in the visual question answering task, but can also answer open-domain questions effectively by leveraging the external knowledge.

视觉问答（VQA）引起了很多关注，因为它可以深入了解图像的多模态分析与自然语言之间的关系。大多数当前算法无法回答需要在图像内容之外执行推理的开放域问题。为了解决这个问题，我们提出了一个新的框架，它通过利用动态内存网络的大量外部知识，赋予模型在回答更复杂问题方面的能力。具体地，问题连同相应的图像触发过程以检索外部知识库中的相关信息，外部知识库通过保留实体关系结构嵌入到连续向量空间中。之后，我们使用动态内存网络来处理知识图和图像中的大量事实，然后对这些事实进行推理以生成相应的答案。大量实验表明，我们的模型不仅可以实现视觉问答环节中最先进的性能，还可以通过利用外部知识有效地回答开放领域的问题。
