##### Abstract
We report the results of subparsec-scale submillimeter observations towards an embedded high-mass young stellar object in the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC) with ALMA. Complementary infrared data obtained with the AKARI satellite and the Gemini South telescope are also presented. The target infrared point source is spatially resolved into two dense molecular cloud cores; one is associated with a high-mass young stellar object (YSO core), while another is not associated with an infrared source (East core). The two cores are dynamically associated but show different chemical characteristics. Emission lines of CS, C33S, H2CS, SO, SO2, CH3OH, H13CO+, H13CN, SiO, and dust continuum are detected from the observed region. Tentative detection of HDS is also reported. The first detection of CH3OH in the SMC has a strong impact on our understanding of the formation of complex organic molecules in metal-poor environments. The gas temperature is estimated to be ~10 K based on the rotation analysis of CH3OH lines. The fractional abundance of CH3OH gas in the East core is estimated to be (0.5-1.5) x 10^(-8), which is comparable with or marginally higher than those of similar cold sources in our Galaxy despite a factor of five lower metallicity in the SMC. This work provides observational evidence that an organic molecule like CH3OH, which is largely formed on grain surfaces, can be produced even in a significantly lower metallicity environment compared to the solar neighborhood. A possible origin of cold CH3OH gas in the observed dense core is discussed.

我们报告了在具有ALMA的小麦哲伦云（SMC）中嵌入的高质量年轻恒星物体的亚稀疏亚毫米观测结果。还介绍了用AKARI卫星和双子座南望远镜获得的互补红外数据。目标红外点源在空间上分解为两个密集的分子云核;一个与高质量的年轻恒星物体（YSO核心）相关联，而另一个与红外源（东部核心）无关。两个核心是动态关联的，但显示出不同的化学特征。从观察区域检测CS，C33S，H2CS，SO，SO2，CH3OH，H13CO +，H13CN，SiO和尘埃连续体的发射线。还报道了对HDS的初步检测。首次检测SMC中的CH3OH对我们对金属贫乏环境中复杂有机分子形成的理解有很大影响。基于CH 3 OH线的旋转分析，估计气体温度为~10K。东核中CH3OH气体的分数丰度估计为（0.5-1.5）×10 ^（ -  8），与银河系类似冷源相当或稍高，尽管金属度低五倍。在SMC。这项工作提供了观察证据，即与太阳能邻域相比，即使在明显较低的金属度环境中，也可以生成主要在颗粒表面形成的有机分子如CH3OH。讨论了观察到的致密核心中冷CH3OH气体的可能来源。
