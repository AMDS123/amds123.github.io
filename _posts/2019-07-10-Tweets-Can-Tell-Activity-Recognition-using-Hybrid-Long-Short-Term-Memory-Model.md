##### Abstract
This paper presents techniques to detect the "offline" activity a person is engaged in when she is tweeting (such as dining, shopping or entertainment), in order to create a dynamic profile of the user, for uses such as better targeting of advertisements. To this end, we propose a hybrid LSTM model for rich contextual learning, along with studies on the effects of applying and combining multiple LSTM based methods with different contextual features. The hybrid model is shown to outperform a set of baselines and state-of-the-art methods. Finally, this paper presents an orthogonal validation with a real-case application. Our model generates an offline activity analysis for the followers of several well-known accounts, which is quite representative of the expected characteristics of these accounts.
