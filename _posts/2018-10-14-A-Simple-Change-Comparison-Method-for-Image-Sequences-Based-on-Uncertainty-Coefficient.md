##### Abstract
For identification of change information in image sequences, most studies focus on change detection in one image sequence, while few studies have considered the change level comparison between two different image sequences. Moreover, most studies require the detection of image information in details, for example, object detection. Based on Uncertainty Coefficient(UC), this paper proposes an innovative method CCUC for change comparison between two image sequences. The proposed method is computationally efficient and simple to implement. The change comparison stems from video monitoring system. The limited number of provided screens and a large number of monitoring cameras require the videos or image sequences ordered by change level. We demonstrate this new method by applying it on two publicly available image sequences. The results are able to show the method can distinguish the different change level for sequences.
