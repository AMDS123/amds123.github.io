##### Abstract
Multi-instance multi-label (MIML) learning is a challenging problem in many aspects. Such learning approaches might be useful for many medical diagnosis applications including breast cancer detection and classification. In this study subset of digiPATH dataset (whole slide digital breast cancer histopathology images) are used for training and evaluation of six state-of-the-art MIML methods. At the end, performance comparison of these approaches are given by means of effective evaluation metrics. It is shown that MIML-kNN achieve the best performance that is %65.3 average precision, where most of other methods attain acceptable results as well.

多实例多标签（MIML）学习在许多方面是一个具有挑战性的问题。这样的学习方法对许多医学诊断应用（包括乳腺癌检测和分类）可能是有用的。在本研究中，digiPATH数据集（整个幻灯片数字乳腺癌组织病理学图像）的子集用于六种最先进的MIML方法的训练和评估。最后，通过有效的评估指标对这些方法进行性能比较。结果表明，MIML-kNN的平均精度达到了最佳性能，其中大多数方法也达到了可接受的结果。
