##### Abstract
Only a few studies have been reported regarding human ear recognition in long wave infrared band. Thus, we have created ear database based on long wave infrared band. We have called that the database is long wave infrared band MIDAS consisting of 2430 records of 81 subjects. Thermal band provides seamless operation both night and day, robust against spoofing with understanding live ear and invariant to illumination conditions for human ear recognition. We have proposed to use different algorithms to reveal the distinctive features. Then, we have reduced the number of dimensions using subspace methods. Finally, the dimension of data is reduced in accordance with the classifier methods. After this, the decision is determined by the best sores or combining some of the best scores with matching fusion. The results have showed that the fusion technique was successful. We have reached 97.71% for rank-1 with 567 test probes. Furthermore, we have defined the perfect rank which is rank number when recognition rate reaches 100% in cumulative matching curve. This evaluation is important for especially forensics, for example corpse identification, criminal investigation etc.

关于长波红外波段人耳识别的研究报道甚少。因此，我们创建了基于长波红外波段的耳朵数据库。我们称这个数据库为长波红外波段MIDAS，由81个科目的2430个记录组成。热带提供无缝操作，无论白天或黑夜，强大的欺骗与理解活耳和不变的照明条件下人耳识别。我们已经提出使用不同的算法来揭示鲜明的特征。然后，我们使用子空间方法减少了维数。最后，根据分类器方法减少数据的维数。在此之后，决定是由最好的伤口决定的，或者将一些最好的分数与匹配的融合结合起来。结果表明，融合技术是成功的。我们已经达到了97.71％的排名第一，567测试探针。此外，在累积匹配曲线中，当识别率达到100％时，我们定义了排名数的完美排名。这个评估对于法医来说非常重要，例如尸体识别，刑事调查等。
