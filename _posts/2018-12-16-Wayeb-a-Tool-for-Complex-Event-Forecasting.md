##### Abstract
Complex Event Processing (CEP) systems have appeared in abundance during the last two decades. Their purpose is to detect in real-time interesting patterns upon a stream of events and to inform an analyst for the occurrence of such patterns in a timely manner. However, there is a lack of methods for forecasting when a pattern might occur before such an occurrence is actually detected by a CEP engine. We present Wayeb, a tool that attempts to address the issue of Complex Event Forecasting. Wayeb employs symbolic automata as a computational model for pattern detection and Markov chains for deriving a probabilistic description of a symbolic automaton.
