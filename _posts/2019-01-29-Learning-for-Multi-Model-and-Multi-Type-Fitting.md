##### Abstract
Multi-model fitting has been extensively studied from the random sampling and clustering perspectives. Most assume that only a single type/class of model is present and their generalizations to fitting multiple types of models/structures simultaneously are non-trivial. The inherent challenges include choice of types and numbers of models, sampling imbalance and parameter tuning, all of which render conventional approaches ineffective. In this work, we formulate the multi-model multi-type fitting problem as one of learning deep feature embedding that is clustering-friendly. In other words, points of the same clusters are embedded closer together through the network. For inference, we apply K-means to cluster the data in the embedded feature space and model selection is enabled by analyzing the K-means residuals. Experiments are carried out on both synthetic and real world multi-type fitting datasets, producing state-of-the-art results. Comparisons are also made on single-type multi-model fitting tasks with promising results as well.
