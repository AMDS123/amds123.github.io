##### Abstract
In the last five years there has been a flurry of work on information extraction from clinical documents, i.e., on algorithms capable of extracting, from the informal and unstructured texts that are generated during everyday clinical practice, mentions of concepts relevant to such practice. Most of this literature is about methods based on supervised learning, i.e., methods for training an information extraction system from manually annotated examples. While a lot of work has been devoted to devising learning methods that generate more and more accurate information extractors, no work has been devoted to investigating the effect of the quality of training data on the learning process. Low quality in training data often derives from the fact that the person who has annotated the data is different from the one against whose judgment the automatically annotated data must be evaluated. In this paper we test the impact of such data quality issues on the accuracy of information extraction systems as applied to the clinical domain. We do this by comparing the accuracy deriving from training data annotated by the authoritative coder (i.e., the one who has also annotated the test data, and by whose judgment we must abide), with the accuracy deriving from training data annotated by a different coder. The results indicate that, although the disagreement between the two coders (as measured on the training set) is substantial, the difference is (surprisingly enough) not always statistically significant.

在过去的五年中，从临床文件中提取信息的工作一直在进行，即从日常临床实践中产生的非正式和非结构化文本中提取与这种实践相关的概念的算法。这些文献中的大多数是关于基于监督学习的方法，即从手动注释的例子训练信息提取系统的方法。虽然大量的工作致力于设计能够产生更多更准确的信息提取器的学习方法，但没有一个工作致力于研究培训数据质量对学习过程的影响。训练数据质量低下的原因通常是由于注解数据的人与评估自动注释数据的人不同。在本文中，我们测试了这些数据质量问题对应用于临床领域的信息提取系统的准确性的影响。我们通过比较由授权编码人员注释的训练数据导出的准确性（即也注释了测试数据的人员以及我们必须遵守的测试数据的人员）的准确度与由不同的编码人员注释的训练数据导出的准确度。结果表明，尽管两个编码者之间的不一致（如在训练集上测量的）是相当大的，但差异（足够令人惊讶地）不总是统计上显着的。
