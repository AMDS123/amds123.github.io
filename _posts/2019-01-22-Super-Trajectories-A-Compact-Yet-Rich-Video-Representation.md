##### Abstract
We propose a new video representation in terms of an over-segmentation of dense trajectories covering the whole video. Trajectories are often used to encode long-temporal information in several computer vision applications. Similar to temporal superpixels, a temporal slice of super-trajectories are superpixels, but the later contains more information because it maintains the long dense pixel-wise tracking information as well. The main challenge in using trajectories for any application, is the accumulation of tracking error in the trajectory construction. For our problem, this results in disconnected superpixels. We exploit constraints for edges in addition to trajectory based color and position similarity. Analogous to superpixels as a preprocessing tool for images, the proposed representation has its applications for videos, especially in trajectory based video analysis.
