##### Abstract
Modern spectroscopic surveys produce large spectroscopic databases, generally with sizes well beyond the scope of manual investigation. The need arises, therefore, for an automated line detection method with objective indicators for detection significance. In this paper, we present an automated and objective method for emission line detection in spectroscopic surveys and apply this technique to 1574 spectra, obtained with the Hectospec spectrograph on the MMT Observatory (MMTO), to detect Lyman alpha emitters near z ~ 2.7. The basic idea is to generate on-source (signal plus noise) and off-source (noise only) mock observations using Monte Carlo simulations, and calculate completeness and reliability values, (C, R), for each simulated signal. By comparing the detections from real data with the Monte Carlo results, we assign the completeness and reliability values to each real detection. From 1574 spectra, we obtain 881 raw detections and, by removing low reliability detections, we finalize 649 detections from an automated pipeline. Most of high completeness and reliability detections, (C, R) ~ (1.0, 1.0), are robust detections when visually inspected; the low C and R detections are also marginal on visual inspection. This method at detecting faint sources is dependent on the accuracy of the sky subtraction.
