##### Abstract
Modern machine learning algorithms have been adopted in a range of signal-processing applications spanning computer vision, natural language processing, and artificial intelligence. Many relevant problems involve subspace-structured features, orthogonality constrained or low-rank constrained objective functions, or subspace distances. These mathematical characteristics are expressed naturally using the Grassmann manifold. Unfortunately, this fact is not yet explored in many traditional learning algorithms. In the last few years, there have been growing interests in studying Grassmann manifold to tackle new learning problems. Such attempts have been reassured by substantial performance improvements in both classic learning and learning using deep neural networks. We term the former as shallow and the latter deep Grassmannian learning. The aim of this paper is to introduce the emerging area of Grassmannian learning by surveying common mathematical problems and primary solution approaches, and overviewing various applications. We hope to inspire practitioners in different fields to adopt the powerful tool of Grassmannian learning in their research.

##### Abstract (translated by Google)
现代机器学习算法已被广泛应用于计算机视觉，自然语言处理和人工智能的各种信号处理应用中。许多相关问题涉及子空间结构特征，正交约束或低秩约束目标函数或子空间距离。这些数学特征使用格拉斯曼流形自然表达。不幸的是，许多传统学习算法尚未探索这一事实。在过去几年中，人们越来越关注研究格拉斯曼流形以解决新的学习问题。通过使用深度神经网络的经典学习和学习中的实质性性能改进，这些尝试得到了保证。我们将前者称为浅层，后者称为深格拉德曼学习。本文的目的是通过调查常见的数学问题和主要解决方案方法以及概述各种应用来介绍Grassmannian学习的新兴领域。我们希望激励不同领域的从业者在他们的研究中采用格拉斯曼学习的强大工具。
