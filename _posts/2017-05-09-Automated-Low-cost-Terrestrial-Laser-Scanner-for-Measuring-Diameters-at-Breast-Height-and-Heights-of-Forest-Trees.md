##### Abstract
Terrestrial laser scanner is a kind of fast, high-precision data acquisition device, which had been more and more applied to the research areas of forest inventory. In this study, a kind of automated low-cost terrestrial laser scanner was designed and implemented based on a two-dimensional laser radar sensor SICK LMS-511 and a stepper motor. The new scanner was named as BEE, which can scan the forest trees in three dimension. The BEE scanner and its supporting software are specifically designed for forest inventory. The experiments have been performed by using the BEE scanner in an artificial ginkgo forest which was located in Haidian district of Beijing. Four square plots were selected to do the experiments. The BEE scanner scanned in the four plots and acquired the single scan data respectively. The DBH, tree height and tree position of trees in the four plots were estimated and analyzed. For comparison, the manual measured data was also collected in the four plots. The tree stem detection rate for all four plots was 92.75%; the root mean square error of the DBH estimation was 1.27cm; the root mean square error of the tree height estimation was 0.24m; the tree position estimation was in line with the actual position. Experimental results show that the BEE scanner can efficiently estimate the structure parameters of forest trees and has a good potential in practical application of forest inventory.

地面激光扫描仪是一种快速，高精度的数据采集设备，已经越来越多的应用到森林资源清查的研究领域。在这项研究中，基于二维激光雷达传感器SICK LMS-511和步进电机，设计并实现了一种自动化的低成本地面激光扫描仪。新扫描仪命名为BEE，可以三维扫描森林树木。 BEE扫描仪及其配套软件专为森林清查而设计。在位于北京市海淀区的人造银杏林中，利用BEE扫描仪进行了实验。选择四个平方地块做实验。 BEE扫描仪扫描四个地块，分别获取单个扫描数据。对四个样地的树木胸径，树高和树木位置进行了估算和分析。为了进行比较，也在四个地块中收集手工测量的数据。全部4个样地的树干检测率为92.75％; DBH估计的均方根误差为1.27cm;树高估计的均方根误差为0.24m;树的位置估计符合实际的位置。实验结果表明，BEE扫描仪可以有效地估计森林树木的结构参数，在森林资源的实际应用中具有较好的应用前景。
