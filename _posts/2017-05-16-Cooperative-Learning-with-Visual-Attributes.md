##### Abstract
Learning paradigms involving varying levels of supervision have received a lot of interest within the computer vision and machine learning communities. The supervisory information is typically considered to come from a human supervisor -- a "teacher" figure. In this paper, we consider an alternate source of supervision -- a "peer" -- i.e. a different machine. We introduce cooperative learning, where two agents trying to learn the same visual concepts, but in potentially different environments using different sources of data (sensors), communicate their current knowledge of these concepts to each other. Given the distinct sources of data in both agents, the mode of communication between the two agents is not obvious. We propose the use of visual attributes -- semantic mid-level visual properties such as furry, wooden, etc.-- as the mode of communication between the agents. Our experiments in three domains -- objects, scenes, and animals -- demonstrate that our proposed cooperative learning approach improves the performance of both agents as compared to their performance if they were to learn in isolation. Our approach is particularly applicable in scenarios where privacy, security and/or bandwidth constraints restrict the amount and type of information the two agents can exchange.

学习范式涉及不同程度的监督，在计算机视觉和机器学习领域受到了很多关注。监管信息通常被认为是来自人力监督员 - “老师”的数字。在本文中，我们考虑一个替代的监督来源 - “同伴” - 即不同的机器。我们引入合作学习，其中两个试图学习相同的视觉概念，但在使用不同来源的数据（传感器）的可能不同的环境中，将他们当前对这些概念的了解相互交流。鉴于两个代理商的数据来源不同，两个代理商之间的沟通方式并不明显。我们建议使用视觉属性 - 诸如毛茸茸，木质等的语义中级视觉属性作为代理之间的交流方式。我们在三个领域（对象，场景和动物）的实验表明，我们提出的合作学习方法提高了两个代理的性能，而不是孤立地学习。我们的方法特别适用于隐私，安全和/或带宽限制限制两个代理可以交换的信息的数量和类型的情况。
