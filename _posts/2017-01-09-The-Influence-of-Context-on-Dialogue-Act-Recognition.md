##### Abstract
This article presents an analysis of the influence of context information on dialog act recognition. We performed experiments on the widely explored Switchboard corpus, as well as on data annotated according to the recent ISO 24617-2 standard. The latter was obtained from the Tilburg DialogBank and through the mapping of the annotations of a subset of the Let's Go corpus. We used a classification approach based on SVMs, which had proved successful in previous work and allowed us to limit the amount of context information provided. This way, we were able to observe the influence patterns as the amount of context information increased. Our base features consisted of n-grams, punctuation, and wh-words. Context information was obtained from one to five preceding segments and provided either as n-grams or dialog act classifications, with the latter typically leading to better results and more stable influence patterns. In addition to the conclusions about the importance and influence of context information, our experiments on the Switchboard corpus also led to results that advanced the state-of-the-art on the dialog act recognition task on that corpus. Furthermore, the results obtained on data annotated according to the ISO 24617-2 standard define a baseline for future work and contribute for the standardization of experiments in the area.

本文分析了情境信息对对话行为识别的影响。我们在广泛探索的交换机语料库上进行了实验，并根据最新的ISO 24617-2标准对数据进行了注释。后者是从蒂尔堡对话银行获得的，并通过映射Let's Go语料库子集的注释。我们使用了基于SVM的分类方法，这在以前的工作中已经证明是成功的，并且允许我们限制所提供的上下文信息的量。通过这种方式，我们可以观察到情景信息量增加时的影响模式。我们的基本特征包括n-gram，标点符号和wh-词。上下文信息是从1到5个前面的段获得的，并且提供为n-gram或者对话行为分类，后者通常导致更好的结果和更稳定的影响模式。除了关于情境信息的重要性和影响的结论之外，我们在交换机语料库上的实验也导致了在该语料库上的对话行为识别任务的最新进展。此外，根据ISO 24617-2标准注释的数据获得的结果为今后的工作定义了一个基准，并有助于该地区实验的标准化。
