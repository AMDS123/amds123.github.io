##### Abstract
The Multitarget Challenge aims to assess how well current speech technology is able to determine whether or not a recorded utterance was spoken by one of a large number of 'blacklisted' speakers. It is a form of multi-target speaker detection based on real-world telephone conversations. Data recordings are generated from call center customer-agent conversations. Each conversation is represented by a single i-vector. Given a pool of training and development data from non-Blacklist and Blacklist speakers, the task is to measure how accurately one can detect 1) whether a test recording is spoken by a Blacklist speaker, and 2) which specific Blacklist speaker was talking.

多目标挑战旨在评估当前语音技术能够确定录制的话语是否被大量“黑名单”发言者之一说出。它是基于真实世界电话交谈的多目标发声器检测的一种形式。数据记录由呼叫中心客户 - 代理对话生成。每个对话由单个i-vector表示。鉴于来自非黑名单和黑名单发言人的培训和开发数据库，​​任务是测量人们可以检测的准确度1）黑名单发言人是否说出测试记录，以及2）哪个特定黑名单发言人正在讲话。
