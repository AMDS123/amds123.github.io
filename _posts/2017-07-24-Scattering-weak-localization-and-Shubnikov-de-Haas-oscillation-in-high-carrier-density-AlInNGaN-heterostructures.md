##### Abstract
We provide the first observation of weak localization in high carrier density two-dimensional electron gas in AlInN/GaN heterostructures; at low temperatures and low fields the conductivity increases with increasing magnetic field. Weak localization is further confirmed by the lnT dependence of the zero-field conductivity and angle dependence of magnetoresistance. The inelastic scattering rate is linearly proportional to temperature, demonstrating that electron-electron scattering is the principal phase breaking mechanism. Shubnikov-de Haas (SdH) oscillations at high magnetic fields are also observed. From the temperature dependent amplitude of SdH oscillation and Dingle plot, the effective mass of electron is extracted to be 0.2327me; in addition the quantum lifetime is smaller than transport time from Hall measurement, indicating small angle scattering such as from remote ionized impurities is dominant. Above 20 K, the scattering changes from acoustic phonon to optical phonon scattering, resulting in a rapid decrease in carrier mobility with increasing temperature.
