##### Abstract
Human aware planning requires an agent to be aware of the intentions, capabilities and mental model of the human in the loop during its decision process. This can involve generating plans that are explicable to a human observer as well as the ability to provide explanations when such plans cannot be generated. This has led to the notion "multi-model planning" which aim to incorporate effects of human expectation in the deliberative process of a planner - either in the form of explicable task planning or explanations produced thereof. In this paper, we bring these two concepts together and show how a planner can account for both these needs and achieve a trade-off during the plan generation process itself by means of a model-space search method MEGA. This in effect provides a comprehensive perspective of what it means for a decision making agent to be "human-aware" by bringing together existing principles of planning under the umbrella of a single plan generation process. We situate our discussion specifically keeping in mind the recent work on explicable planning and explanation generation, and illustrate these concepts in modified versions of two well known planning domains, as well as a demonstration on a robot involved in a typical search and reconnaissance task with an external supervisor.

##### Abstract (translated by Google)
人类意识的规划要求代理人在决策过程中意识到人类在循环中的意图，能力和心智模式。这可能涉及到生成一个人类观察者可以解释的计划，以及在无法生成这样的计划时提供解释的能力。这导致了“多模式计划”的概念，其目的是将人的期望的影响纳入计划者的审议过程中，或者以可解释的任务计划或解释的形式。在本文中，我们将这两个概念结合在一起，展示了一个规划人员如何在计划生成过程中通过模型空间搜索方法MEGA来解决这两个需求并实现权衡。这实际上提供了一个全面的观点，即通过在单一计划生成过程的保护下汇集现有的计划原则，使决策代理人具有“人类意识”的含义。我们将讨论的具体位置放在了最近的关于可解释计划和解释生成的工作上，并以两个着名计划域的修改版本来说明这些概念，以及一个涉及典型搜索和侦察任务的机器人的演示外部监督员。
