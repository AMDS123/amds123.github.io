##### Abstract
In the Pacific Coast of Colombia there is a type of marimba called marimba de chonta, which provides the melodic and harmonic contour for traditional music with characteristic chants and dances. The tunings of this marimba are based on the voice of female singers and allows musical practices, as a transposition that preserves relative distances between bars. Here we show that traditional tunings are consistent with isotonic scales, and that they have changed in the last three decades due to the influence of Western music. Specifically, low octaves have changed into just octaves. Additionally, consonance properties of this instrument include the occurrence of a broad minimum of dissonance that is used in the musical practices, while the narrow local peaks of dissonance are avoided. We found that the main reason for this is the occurrence of uncertainties in the tunings with respect to the mathematical successions of isotonic scales. We conclude that in this music the emergence of tunings and musical practices cannot be considered as separate issues. Consonance, timbre, and musical practices are entangled.

在哥伦比亚太平洋海岸有一种称为marimba de chonta的马林巴，它为传统音乐提供了旋律和谐的轮廓，并带有特有的吟唱和舞蹈。这种马林巴琴的调音基于女性歌手的声音，并允许音乐练习，作为保留小节之间相对距离的转换。在这里，我们展示了传统的调音与等张音阶一致，并且由于西方音乐的影响，他们在过去的三十年中发生了变化。具体而言，低八度变成了八度。此外，这种乐器的协调特性包括在音乐练习中使用的广泛的最小不协调的发生，而避免了不协调的狭窄局部峰值。我们发现其主要原因是调谐中关于等渗尺度数学演变的不确定性。我们的结论是，在这种音乐中，调音和音乐练习的出现不能被视为单独的问题。和声，音色和音乐习惯纠缠在一起。
