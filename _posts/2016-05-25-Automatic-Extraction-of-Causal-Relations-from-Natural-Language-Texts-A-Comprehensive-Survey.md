##### Abstract
Automatic extraction of cause-effect relationships from natural language texts is a challenging open problem in Artificial Intelligence. Most of the early attempts at its solution used manually constructed linguistic and syntactic rules on small and domain-specific data sets. However, with the advent of big data, the availability of affordable computing power and the recent popularization of machine learning, the paradigm to tackle this problem has slowly shifted. Machines are now expected to learn generic causal extraction rules from labelled data with minimal supervision, in a domain independent-manner. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive survey of causal relation extraction techniques from both paradigms, and analyse their relative strengths and weaknesses, with recommendations for future work.

##### Abstract (translated by Google)
从自然语言文本中自动提取因果关系在人工智能中是一个具有挑战性的开放问题。其解决方案的大多数早期尝试都是针对小型和特定于领域的数据集手动构建语言和语法规则。然而，随着大数据的出现，负担得起的计算能力的可用性以及近期机器学习的普及，解决这个问题的范式正在慢慢转移。现在希望机器以独立于领域的方式从最小监督的标签数据中学习通用的因果提取规则。本文从两种范式对因果关系提取技术进行全面的调查，分析两者的相对优缺点，并对今后的工作提出建议。
