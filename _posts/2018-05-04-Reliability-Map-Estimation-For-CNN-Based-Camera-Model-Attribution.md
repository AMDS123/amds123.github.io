##### Abstract
Among the image forensic issues investigated in the last few years, great attention has been devoted to blind camera model attribution. This refers to the problem of detecting which camera model has been used to acquire an image by only exploiting pixel information. Solving this problem has great impact on image integrity assessment as well as on authenticity verification. Recent advancements that use convolutional neural networks (CNNs) in the media forensic field have enabled camera model attribution methods to work well even on small image patches. These improvements are also important for determining forgery localization. Some patches of an image may not contain enough information related to the camera model (e.g., saturated patches). In this paper, we propose a CNN-based solution to estimate the camera model attribution reliability of a given image patch. We show that we can estimate a reliability-map indicating which portions of the image contain reliable camera traces. Testing using a well known dataset confirms that by using this information, it is possible to increase small patch camera model attribution accuracy by more than 8% on a single patch.

在过去几年中调查的图像取证问题中，盲目相机模型归因已经引起了极大的关注。这涉及通过仅利用像素信息来检测哪个相机模型已被用于获取图像的问题。解决这个问题对图像完整性评估和真实性验证都有很大的影响。在媒体取证领域使用卷积神经网络（CNN）的最新进展已使相机模型归因方法即使在小图像补丁上也能正常工作。这些改进对于确定伪造本地化也很重要。某些图像的补丁可能不包含与相机模型相关的足够信息（例如饱和补丁）。在本文中，我们提出了基于CNN的解决方案来估计给定图像片的相机模型归因可靠性。我们表明，我们可以估计一个可靠性图，指示图像的哪些部分包含可靠的相机轨迹。使用众所周知的数据集进行测试证实，通过使用此信息，可以在单个补丁上将小型斑点相机模型归因精度提高8％以上。
