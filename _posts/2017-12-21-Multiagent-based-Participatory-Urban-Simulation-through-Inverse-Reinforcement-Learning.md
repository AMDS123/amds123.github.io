##### Abstract
The multiagent-based participatory simulation features prominently in urban planning as the acquired model is considered as the hybrid system of the domain and the local knowledge. However, the key problem of generating realistic agents for particular social phenomena invariably remains. The existing models have attempted to dictate the factors involving human behavior, which appeared to be intractable. In this paper, Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL) is introduced to address this problem. IRL is developed for computational modeling of human behavior and has achieved great successes in robotics, psychology and machine learning. The possibilities presented by this new style of modeling are drawn out as conclusions, and the relative challenges with this modeling are highlighted.

##### Abstract (translated by Google)
基于多Agent的参与式模拟在城市规划中具有突出的地位，因为所获得的模型被认为是领域和地方知识的混合系统。然而，为特定社会现象产生现实主体的关键问题总是存在。现有的模式试图决定涉及人类行为的因素，而这些因素似乎是棘手的。在本文中，逆向强化学习（IRL）被引入来解决这个问题。 IRL被开发用于人类行为的计算建模，并在机器人，心理学和机器学习方面取得了巨大的成功。这种新的建模方式所呈现的可能性被作为结论，并强调了这种建模的相关挑战。
