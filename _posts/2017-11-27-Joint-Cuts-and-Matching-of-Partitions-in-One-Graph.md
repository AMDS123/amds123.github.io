##### Abstract
As two fundamental problems, graph cuts and graph matching have been investigated over decades, resulting in vast literature in these two topics respectively. However the way of jointly applying and solving graph cuts and matching receives few attention. In this paper, we first formalize the problem of simultaneously cutting a graph into two partitions i.e. graph cuts and establishing their correspondence i.e. graph matching. Then we develop an optimization algorithm by updating matching and cutting alternatively, provided with theoretical analysis. The efficacy of our algorithm is verified on both synthetic dataset and real-world images containing similar regions or structures.

作为两个基本问题，几十年来，图切割和图匹配已经被研究，分别在这两个主题上产生了大量的文献。然而，共同应用和解决图切割和匹配的方式却很少受到关注。在本文中，我们首先将图形同时切割成两个分区的问题，即图形切割和建立它们的对应关系即图形匹配。然后通过交替更新匹配和切割来开发优化算法，并进行理论分析。我们的算法的功效在包含相似区域或结构的合成数据集和真实图像上都得到了验证。
