##### Abstract
The capability of making explainable inferences regarding physical processes has long been desired. One fundamental physical process is object motion. Inferring what causes the motion of a group of objects can even be a challenging task for experts, e.g., in forensics science. Most of the work in the literature relies on physics simulation to draw such infer- ences. The simulation requires a precise model of the under- lying domain to work well and is essentially a black-box from which one can hardly obtain any useful explanation. By contrast, qualitative reasoning methods have the advan- tage in making transparent inferences with ambiguous infor- mation, which makes it suitable for this task. However, there has been no suitable qualitative theory proposed for object motion in three-dimensional space. In this paper, we take this challenge and develop a qualitative theory for the motion of rigid objects. Based on this theory, we develop a reasoning method to solve a very interesting problem: Assuming there are several objects that were initially at rest and now have started to move. We want to infer what action causes the movement of these objects.

人们一直希望能够对物理过程作出可解释的推论。一个基本的物理过程是物体运动。推断导致一组物体运动的原因对于专家来说甚至可能是一项具有挑战性的任务，例如在法医学中。文献中的大部分工作都依赖于物理模拟来得出这样的推论。模拟需要一个精确的底层域模型才能很好地工作，并且本质上是一个黑盒子，人们很难从中得到任何有用的解释。相比之下，定性推理方法在利用模糊信息进行透明推理方面具有优势，这使得它适合于这项任务。然而，对于三维空间中的物体运动，没有提出合适的定性理论。在本文中，我们采取这一挑战，并为刚性物体的运动开发定性理论。基于这个理论，我们开发了一种推理方法来解决一个非常有趣的问题：假设有几个对象最初处于静止状态，现在已经开始移动了。我们想要推断出导致这些对象移动的动作。
