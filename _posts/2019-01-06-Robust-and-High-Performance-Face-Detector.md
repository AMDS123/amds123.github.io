##### Abstract
In recent years, face detection has experienced significant performance improvement with the boost of deep convolutional neural networks. In this report, we reimplement the state-of-the-art detector SRN and apply some tricks proposed in the recent literatures to obtain an extremely strong face detector, named VIM-FD. In specific, we exploit more powerful backbone network like DenseNet-121, revisit the data augmentation based on data-anchor-sampling proposed in PyramidBox, and use the max-in-out label and anchor matching strategy in SFD. In addition, we also introduce the attention mechanism to provide additional supervision. Over the most popular and challenging face detection benchmark, i.e., WIDER FACE, the proposed VIM-FD achieves state-of-the-art performance.
