##### Abstract
The essential graph is a distinguished member of a Markov equivalence class of AMP chain graphs. However, the directed edges in the essential graph are not necessarily strong or invariant, i.e. they may not be shared by every member of the equivalence class. Likewise for the undirected edges. In this paper, we develop a procedure for identifying which edges in an essential graph are strong. We also show how this makes it possible to bound some causal effects when the true chain graph is unknown.

基本图是AMP链图的马尔可夫等价类的一个显着成员。然而，基本图中的有向边不一定强或不变，即它们可能不会被等价类的每个成员共享。对于无向边缘也是如此。在本文中，我们开发了一个用于识别基本图中哪些边强的程序。我们还展示了如何在真实链图未知的情况下限制一些因果效应。
