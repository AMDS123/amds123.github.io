##### Abstract
The Vocal Joystick Vowel Corpus, by Washington University, was used to study monophthongs pronounced by native English speakers. The objective of this study was to quantitatively measure the extent at which speech recognition methods can distinguish between similar sounding vowels. In particular, the phonemes /\textipa{@}/, /{\ae}/, /\textipa{A}:/ and /\textipa{2}/ were analysed. 748 sound files from the corpus were used and subjected to Linear Predictive Coding (LPC) to compute their formants, and to Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC) algorithm, to compute the cepstral coefficients. A Decision Tree Classifier was used to build a predictive model that learnt the patterns of the two first formants measured in the data set, as well as the patterns of the 13 cepstral coefficients. An accuracy of 70\% was achieved using formants for the mentioned phonemes. For the MFCC analysis an accuracy of 52 \% was achieved and an accuracy of 71\% when /\textipa{@}/ was ignored. The results obtained show that the studied algorithms are far from mimicking the ability of distinguishing subtle differences in sounds like human hearing does.

华盛顿大学的声乐操纵杆元音语料库被用来研究母语为英语的人所发出的单元音。这项研究的目的是定量测量语音识别方法可以区分类似的探测元音的程度。特别是分析了音素/ \ textipa {@} /，/ {\ ae} /，/ \ textipa {A}：/和/ \ textipa {2} /。使用来自语料库的748个声音文件并使用线性预测编码（LPC）来计算它们的频谱，并且使用Mel频率倒谱系数（MFCC）算法来计算倒频谱系数。决策树分类器被用来建立一个预测模型，它学习了数据集中测量的两个第一个模式的模式，以及13个倒谱系数的模式。使用上述音素的formants实现了70％的准确度。对于MFCC分析，精度达到了52％，忽略了\ \ textipa {@} /时的精确度为71％。得到的结果表明，所研究的算法远非模仿像人类听觉那样区分声音中微妙差异的能力。
