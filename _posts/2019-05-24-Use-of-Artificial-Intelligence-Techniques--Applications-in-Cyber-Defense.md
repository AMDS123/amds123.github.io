##### Abstract
Nowadays, considering the speed of the processes and the amount of data used in cyber defense, it cannot be expected to have an effective defense by using only human power without the help of automation systems. However, for the effective defense against dynamically evolving attacks on networks, it is difficult to develop software with conventional fixed algorithms. This can be achieved by using artificial intelligence methods that provide flexibility and learning capability. The likelihood of developing cyber defense capabilities through increased intelligence of defense systems is quite high. Given the problems associated with cyber defense in real life, it is clear that many cyber defense problems can be successfully solved only when artificial intelligence methods are used. In this article, the current artificial intelligence practices and techniques are reviewed and the use and importance of artificial intelligence in cyber defense systems is mentioned. The aim of this article is to be able to explain the use of these methods in the field of cyber defense with current examples by considering and analyzing the artificial intelligence technologies and methodologies that are currently being developed and integrating them with the role and adaptation of the technology and methodology in the defense of cyberspace.
