##### Abstract
Skin cancer is a widespread, global, and potentially deadly disease, which over the last three decades has afflicted more lives in the USA than all other forms of cancer combined. There have been a lot of promising recent works utilizing deep network architectures, such as FCNs, U-Nets, and ResNets, for developing automated skin lesion segmentation. This paper investigates various pre- and post-processing techniques for improving the performance of U-Nets as measured by the Jaccard Index. The dataset provided as part of the "2017 ISBI Challenges on Skin Lesion Analysis Towards Melanoma Detection" was used for this evaluation and the performance of the finalist competitors was the standard for comparison. The pre-processing techniques employed in the proposed system included contrast enhancement, artifact removal, and vignette correction. More advanced image transformations, such as local binary patterns and wavelet decomposition, were also employed to augment the raw grayscale images used as network input features. While the performance of the proposed system fell short of the winners of the challenge, it was determined that using wavelet decomposition as an early transformation step improved the overall performance of the system over pre- and post-processing steps alone.

皮肤癌是一种普遍的，全球性的，可能致命的疾病，在过去的三十年中，美国的生命受到的影响远远超过所有其他形式的癌症。最近有许多有前途的工作利用深度网络体系结构，如FCN，U-Nets和ResNets来开发自动皮肤病灶分割。本文调查了Jaccard指数衡量的各种改进U-Nets性能的前后处理技术。作为“2017 ISBI皮肤病变分析对黑色素瘤检测挑战”的一部分提供的数据集用于本次评估，最终入围的竞争对手的表现是比较的标准。所提出的系统中采用的预处理技术包括对比度增强，伪像去除和阴影校正。更高级的图像转换，如局部二进制模式和小波分解，也被用来增强用作网络输入特征的原始灰度图像。虽然所提出的系统的性能没有达到挑战的胜利者，但确定使用小波分解作为早期变换步骤改善了系统在仅处理前和后处理步骤上的总体性能。
