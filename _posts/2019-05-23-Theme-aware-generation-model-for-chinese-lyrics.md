##### Abstract
With rapid development of neural networks, deep-learning has been extended to various natural language generation fields, such as machine translation, dialogue generation and even literature creation. In this paper, we propose a theme-aware language generation model for Chinese music lyrics, which improves the theme-connectivity and coherence of generated paragraphs greatly. A multi-channel sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) model encodes themes and previous sentences as global and local contextual information. Moreover, attention mechanism is incorporated for sequence decoding, enabling to fuse context into predicted next texts. To prepare appropriate train corpus, LDA (Latent Dirichlet Allocation) is applied for theme extraction. Generated lyrics is grammatically correct and semantically coherent with selected themes, which offers a valuable modelling method in other fields including multi-turn chatbots, long paragraph generation and etc.
