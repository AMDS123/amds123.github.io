##### Abstract
Emojis have become a very popular part of daily digital communication. Their appeal comes largely in part due to their ability to capture and elicit emotions in a more subtle and nuanced way than just plain text is able to. In line with recent advances in the field of deep learning, there are far reaching implications and applications that generative adversarial networks (GANs) can have for image generation. In this paper, we present a novel application of deep convolutional GANs (DC-GANs) with an optimized training procedure. We show that via incorporation of word embeddings conditioned on Google's word2vec model into the network, the generator is able to synthesize highly realistic emojis that are virtually identical to the real ones.

表情符号已经成为日常数字通信中非常受欢迎的一部分。他们的吸引力在很大程度上是因为他们能够以一种更为微妙和微妙的方式捕捉和引发情感，而不仅仅是纯文本能够。与深度学习领域的最新进展一致，生成对抗网络（GAN）可以产生图像的深远影响和应用。在本文中，我们提出了深度卷积GANs（DC-GANs）的一个新的应用与优化的训练过程。我们表明，通过将嵌入在word2vec模型中的word嵌入到网络中，生成器能够合成高度真实的emojis，这些emojis几乎与真实的emojis相同。
