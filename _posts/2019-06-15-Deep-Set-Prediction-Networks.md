##### Abstract
We study the problem of predicting a set from a feature vector with a deep neural network. Existing approaches ignore the set structure of the problem and suffer from discontinuity issues as a result. We propose a general model for predicting sets that properly respects the structure of sets and avoids this problem. With a single feature vector as input, we show that our model is able to auto-encode point sets, predict bounding boxes of the set of objects in an image, and predict the attributes of these objects in an image.
