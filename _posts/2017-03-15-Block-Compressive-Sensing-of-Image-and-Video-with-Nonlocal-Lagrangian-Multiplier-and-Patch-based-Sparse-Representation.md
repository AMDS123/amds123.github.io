##### Abstract
Although block compressive sensing (BCS) makes it tractable to sense large-sized images and video, its recovery performance has yet to be significantly improved because its recovered images or video usually suffer from blurred edges, loss of details, and high-frequency oscillatory artifacts, especially at a low subrate. This paper addresses these problems by designing a modified total variation technique that employs multi-block gradient processing, a denoised Lagrangian multiplier, and patch-based sparse representation. In the case of video, the proposed recovery method is able to exploit both spatial and temporal similarities. Simulation results confirm the improved performance of the proposed method for compressive sensing of images and video in terms of both objective and subjective qualities.

尽管块压缩感知（BCS）使得易于感知大尺寸图像和视频，但是其恢复性能还有待显着提高，因为其恢复的图像或视频通常遭受边缘模糊，细节损失以及高频振荡伪像尤其是在低速下。本文通过设计采用多块梯度处理的改进的总变分技术，去噪拉格朗日乘子和基于块的稀疏表示来解决这些问题。在视频的情况下，所提出的恢复方法能够利用空间和时间的相似性。仿真结果证实了所提出的图像和视频压缩感测方法在客观和主观质量方面的改进性能。
