##### Abstract
Recent years have witnessed amazing progress in AI related fields such as computer vision, machine learning and autonomous vehicles. As with any rapidly growing field, however, it becomes increasingly difficult to stay up-to-date or enter the field as a beginner. While several topic specific survey papers have been written, to date no general survey on problems, datasets and methods in computer vision for autonomous vehicles exists. This paper attempts to narrow this gap by providing a state-of-the-art survey on this topic. Our survey includes both the historically most relevant literature as well as the current state-of-the-art on several specific topics, including recognition, reconstruction, motion estimation, tracking, scene understanding and end-to-end learning. Towards this goal, we first provide a taxonomy to classify each approach and then analyze the performance of the state-of-the-art on several challenging benchmarking datasets including KITTI, ISPRS, MOT and Cityscapes. Besides, we discuss open problems and current research challenges. To ease accessibility and accommodate missing references, we will also provide an interactive platform which allows to navigate topics and methods, and provides additional information and project links for each paper.

##### Abstract (translated by Google)
近年来，在计算机视觉，机器学习和自动驾驶汽车等人工智能相关领域取得了惊人的进展。然而，随着任何快速发展的领域，保持最新或作为初学者进入该领域变得越来越困难。虽然已经撰写了几篇专题具体调查报告，但迄今为止还没有关于自主车辆的计算机视觉问题，数据集和方法的一般调查。本文试图通过提供关于这个主题的最新调查来缩小这个差距。我们的调查既包括历史上最相关的文献，也包括当前最先进的几个具体主题，包括识别，重建，运动估计，跟踪，场景理解和端到端学习。为了实现这一目标，我们首先提供了一个分类法，对每种方法进行分类，然后分析KITTI，ISPRS，MOT和Cityscapes等几个具有挑战性的基准数据库的最新性能。此外，我们还讨论了开放问题和当前的研究挑战。为了便于访问和适应缺少的参考，我们还将提供一个交互式平台，可以浏览主题和方法，并为每篇论文提供额外的信息和项目链接。
