##### Abstract
Regular decompositions are necessary for most superpixel-based object recognition or tracking applications. So far in the literature, the regularity or compactness of a superpixel shape is mainly measured by its circularity. In this work, we first demonstrate that such measure is not adapted for superpixel evaluation, since it does not directly express regularity but circular appearance. Then, we propose a new metric that considers several shape regularity aspects: convexity, balanced repartition, and contour smoothness. Finally, we demonstrate that our measure is robust to scale and noise and enables to more relevantly compare superpixel methods.
