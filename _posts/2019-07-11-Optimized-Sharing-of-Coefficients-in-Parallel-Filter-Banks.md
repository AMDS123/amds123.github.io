##### Abstract
Filters are the basic and most important blocks of most signal processing applications. In many applications, a group of parallel filters are used as filter banks. Parallel filter banks naturally require much more computations. Especially on chip applications, the resources are limited and shared among many algorithms. For this purpose, many filter optimization schemes are proposed to reduce the number of resources that filtering operations require. In this work, a novel optimization algorithm is proposed to decrease the number of operations in a group of parallel filters. The filter coefficients are grouped in a two stage process which enables increased coefficient sharing between different filters. The algorithm is capable of decreasing the number of registers, look-up tables and DSP48s by up to 50\% of a regular parallel filter bank, without requiring increased sampling rate.
