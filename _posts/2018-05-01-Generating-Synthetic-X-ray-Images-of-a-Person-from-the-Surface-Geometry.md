##### Abstract
We present a novel framework that learns to predict human anatomy from body surface. Specifically, our approach generates a synthetic X-ray image of a person only from the person's surface geometry. Furthermore, the synthetic X-ray image is parametrized and can be manipulated by adjusting a set of body markers which are also generated during the X-ray image prediction. With the proposed framework, multiple synthetic X-ray images can easily be generated by varying surface geometry. By perturbing the parameters, several additional synthetic X-ray images can be generated from the same surface geometry. As a result, our approach offers a potential to overcome the training data barrier in the medical domain. This capability is achieved by learning a pair of networks - one learns to generate the full image from the partial image and a set of parameters, and the other learns to estimate the parameters given the full image. During training, the two networks are trained iteratively such that they would converge to a solution where the predicted parameters and the full image are consistent with each other. In addition to medical data enrichment, our framework can also be used for image completion as well as anomaly detection.

我们提出了一个新的框架，学习从体表预测人体解剖学。具体而言，我们的方法仅根据人的表面几何形状生成人的合成X射线图像。此外，合成X射线图像被参数化并且可以通过调整也在X射线图像预测期间生成的一组身体标记来操纵。利用所提出的框架，通过改变表面几何形状可以容易地生成多个合成X射线图像。通过扰动参数，可以从相同的表面几何形状生成几个附加的合成X射线图像。因此，我们的方法提供了克服医疗领域培训数据障碍的潜力。这种能力是通过学习一对网络来实现的 - 一个学习从部分图像和一组参数生成完整图像，另一个学习根据完整图像估计参数。在训练期间，迭代地训练这两个网络，使得它们会聚到预测参数和完整图像彼此一致的解决方案。除了医学数据丰富之外，我们的框架还可以用于图像完成以及异常检测。
