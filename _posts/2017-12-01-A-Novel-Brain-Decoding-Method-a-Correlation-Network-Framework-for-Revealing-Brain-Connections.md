##### Abstract
Brain decoding is a hot spot in cognitive science, which focuses on reconstructing perceptual images from brain activities. Analyzing the correlations of collected data from human brain activities and representing activity patterns are two problems in brain decoding based on functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) signals. However, existing correlation analysis methods mainly focus on the strength information of voxel, which reveals functional connectivity in the cerebral cortex. They tend to neglect the structural information that implies the intracortical or intrinsic connections; that is, structural connectivity. Hence, the effective connectivity inferred by these methods is relatively unilateral. Therefore, we proposed a correlation network (CorrNet) framework that could be flexibly combined with diverse pattern representation models. In the CorrNet framework, the topological correlation was introduced to reveal structural information. Rich correlations were obtained, which contributed to specifying the underlying effective connectivity. We also combined the CorrNet framework with a linear support vector machine (SVM) and a dynamic evolving spike neuron network (SNN) for pattern representation separately, thus providing a novel method for decoding cognitive activity patterns. Experimental results verified the reliability and robustness of our CorrNet framework and demonstrated that the new method achieved significant improvement in brain decoding over comparable methods.

脑解码是认知科学中的一个热点，重点是重构大脑活动的感知图像。分析人脑活动采集数据与表征活动模式的相关性是基于功能磁共振成像（fMRI）信号脑解码的两个问题。但现有的相关分析方法主要集中在体素的强度信息上，揭示了大脑皮质的功能连通性。他们倾向于忽视暗含皮质内或内在联系的结构信息;即结构连通性。因此，这些方法推断的有效连通性是相对单一的。因此，我们提出了一个可以灵活地与多种模式表示模型相结合的相关网络（CorrNet）框架。在CorrNet框架中，引入了拓扑关系来揭示结构信息。获得了丰富的相关性，这有助于指定潜在的有效连接。我们还将CorrNet框架与线性支持向量机（SVM）和动态演化尖峰神经网络（SNN）分别进行模式表示，从而为解码认知活动模式提供了一种新的方法。实验结果验证了我们的CorrNet框架的可靠性和鲁棒性，并证明新方法在可比方法上实现了大脑解码方面的显着改进。
