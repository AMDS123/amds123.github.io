##### Abstract
The connected automated vehicle has been often touted as a technology that will become pervasive in society in the near future. One can view an automated vehicle as having Artificial Intelligence (AI) capabilities, being able to self-drive, sense its surroundings, recognise objects in its vicinity, and perform reasoning and decision-making. 
 Rather than being stand alone, we examine the need for automated vehicles to cooperate and interact within their socio-cyber-physical environments, including the problems cooperation will solve, but also the issues and challenges. We review current work in cooperation for automated vehicles, based on selected examples from the literature. We conclude noting the need for the ability to behave cooperatively as a form of social-AI capability for automated vehicles, beyond sensing the immediate environment and beyond the underlying networking technology.
