##### Abstract
"People want an authority to tell them how to value things. But they chose this authority not based on facts or results. They chose it because it seems authoritative and familiar." - The Big Short The pavement condition index is one such a familiar measure used by many US cities to measure street quality and justify billions of dollars spent every year on street repair. These billion-dollar decisions are based on evaluation criteria that are subjective and not representative. In this paper, we build upon our initial submission to D4GX 2015 that approaches this problem of information asymmetry in municipal decision-making. We describe a process to identify street-defects using computer vision techniques on data collected using the Street Quality Identification Device (SQUID). A User Interface to host a large quantity of image data towards digitizing the street inspection process and enabling actionable intelligence for a core public service is also described. This approach of combining device, data and decision-making around street repair enables cities make targeted decisions about street repair and could lead to an anticipatory response which can result in significant cost savings. Lastly, we share lessons learnt from the deployment of SQUID in the city of Syracuse, NY.

##### Abstract (translated by Google)
“人们想要权威来告诉他们如何看待事物，但是他们选择的并不是事实或结果，而是因为它看起来是权威和熟悉的。” - 大缺点路面状况指数是许多美国城市用来衡量街道质量的一个熟悉的措施，并且证明每年在街道维修上花费数十亿美元。这些十亿美元的决定是基于主观而不具代表性的评估标准的。在本文中，我们首先提交给D4GX 2015，这个文件解决了市政决策中信息不对称的问题。我们描述了使用计算机视觉技术来识别使用街道质量识别设备（SQUID）收集的数据的街道缺陷的过程。还介绍了一个用户界面，用于托管大量的图像数据，使街道检查过程数字化，并为核心公共服务提供可操作的情报。这种将街道维修中的设备，数据和决策相结合的方法使得城市能够针对街道维修做出有针对性的决定，并可能导致预期的回应，从而大幅节省成本。最后，我们分享在纽约州锡拉丘兹市部署SQUID的经验教训。
