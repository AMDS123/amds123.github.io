##### Abstract
Sequence labeling for extraction of medical events and their attributes from unstructured text in Electronic Health Record (EHR) notes is a key step towards semantic understanding of EHRs. It has important applications in health informatics including pharmacovigilance and drug surveillance. The state of the art supervised machine learning models in this domain are based on Conditional Random Fields (CRFs) with features calculated from fixed context windows. In this application, we explored various recurrent neural network frameworks and show that they significantly outperformed the CRF models.

电子健康记录（EHR）笔记中用于从非结构化文本中提取医疗事件及其属性的序列标记是对EHR的语义理解的关键步骤。它在医疗信息学中有重要的应用，包括药物警戒和药物监测。该领域中的监督机器学习模型的状态基于条件随机场（CRF），其具有从固定上下文窗口计算的特征。在这个应用程序中，我们探索了各种经常性的神经网络框架，并表明它们显着优于CRF模型。
