##### Abstract
Deep neural networks have recently been used to edit images with great success, in particular for faces. However, they are often limited to only being able to work at a restricted range of resolutions. Many methods are so flexible that face edits can often result in an unwanted loss of identity. This work proposes to learn how to perform semantic image edits through the application of smooth warp fields. Previous approaches that attempted to use warping for semantic edits required paired data, i.e. example images of the same subject with different semantic attributes. In contrast, we employ recent advances in Generative Adversarial Networks that allow our model to be trained with unpaired data. We demonstrate face editing at very high resolutions (4k images) with a single forward pass of a deep network at a lower resolution. We also show that our edits are substantially better at preserving the subject's identity.
