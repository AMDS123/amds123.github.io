##### Abstract
We propose a rule-based technique to generate redundancy-free NL descriptions of OWL entities.The existing approaches which address the problem of verbalizing OWL ontologies generate NL text segments which are close to their counterpart OWL statements.Some of these approaches also perform grouping and aggregating of these NL text segments to generate a more fluent and comprehensive form of the content.Restricting our attention to description of individuals and concepts, we find that the approach currently followed in the available tools is that of determining the set of all logical conditions that are satisfied by the given individual/concept name and translate these conditions verbatim into corresponding NL descriptions.Human-understandability of such descriptions is affected by the presence of repetitions and redundancies, as they have high fidelity to their OWL representation.In the literature, no efforts had been taken to remove redundancies and repetitions at the logical-level before generating the NL descriptions of entities and we find this to be the main reason for lack of readability of the generated text.Herein, we propose a technique called semantic-refinement(SR) to generate meaningful and easily-understandable descriptions of individuals and concepts of a given OWLontology.We identify the combinations of OWL/DL constructs that lead to repetitive/redundant descriptions and propose a series of refinement rules to rewrite the conditions that are satisfied by an individual/concept in a meaning-preserving manner.The reduced set of conditions are then employed for generating NL descriptions.Our experiments show that, SR leads to significantly improved descriptions of ontology entities.We also test the effectiveness and usefulness of the the generated descriptions for the purpose of validating the ontologies and find that the proposed technique is indeed helpful in the context.

##### Abstract (translated by Google)
我们提出了一种基于规则的技术来生成OWL实体的无冗余NL描述。解决OWL本体的表达问题的现有方法生成接近它们的对应OWL语句的NL文本段。这些方法中的一些还执行分组和汇总这些NL文本段以产生更加流畅和全面的内容形式。将我们的注意力集中在对个人和概念的描述上，我们发现当前可用工具的方法是确定所有逻辑条件被给定的个人/概念名称所满足，并将这些条件逐字地转换成相应的NL描述。这些描述的人类可理解性受到重复和冗余的存在的影响，因为它们对OWL表示具有高保真度。在文献中，已经采取措施消除逻辑层面的冗余和重复我们发现这是造成生成文本缺乏可读性的主要原因。我们提出了一种称为语义细化（SR）的技术来生成有意义且易于理解的个体和概念的描述我们确定OWL / DL构造的组合，导致重复性/冗余性描述，并提出一系列细化规则，以保留意义的方式重写个体/概念所满足的条件。然后利用条件生成NL描述。我们的实验表明，SR导致本体实体描述的显着改善。为了验证本体，我们还测试了生成的描述的有效性和有用性，发现所提出的技术在这方面确实有帮助。
