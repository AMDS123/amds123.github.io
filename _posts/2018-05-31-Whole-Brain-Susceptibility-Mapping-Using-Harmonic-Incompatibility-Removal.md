##### Abstract
Quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM) uses the phase data in magnetic resonance signal to visualize a three dimensional susceptibility distribution by solving the magnetic field to susceptibility inverse problem. Due to the presence of zeros of the integration kernel in the frequency domain, QSM is an ill-posed inverse problem. Although numerous regularization based models have been proposed to overcome this problem, the incompatibility in the field data has not received enough attention, which leads to deterioration of the recovery. In this paper, we show that the data acquisition process of QSM inherently generates a harmonic incompatibility in the measured local field. Based on such discovery, we propose a novel regularization based susceptibility reconstruction model with an additional sparsity based regularization term on the harmonic incompatibility. Numerical experiments show that the proposed method achieves better performance than the existing approaches.

定量磁敏度图（QSM）使用磁共振信号中的相位数据通过将磁场求解为磁化率反问题来使三维磁化率分布可视化。由于积分内核在频域中存在零点，QSM是一个不适定的反问题。虽然已经提出了许多基于正则化的模型来克服这个问题，但是现场数据中的不兼容性还没有得到足够的重视，这导致了恢复的恶化。在本文中，我们表明，QSM的数据采集过程固有地在测量的局部场中产生谐波不相容性。基于这样的发现，我们提出了一种新的基于正则化的磁化率重构模型，该模型在谐波不相容性基础上增加了基于稀疏度的正则化项。数值实验表明，该方法比现有方法具有更好的性能。
