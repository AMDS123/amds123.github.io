##### Abstract
Annotating the right data for training deep neural networks is an important challenge. Active learning using uncertainty estimates from Bayesian Neural Networks (BNNs) could provide an effective solution to this. Despite being theoretically principled, BNNs require approximations to be applied to large-scale problems, and have not been used widely by practitioners. In this paper, we introduce Deep Probabilistic Ensembles (DPEs), a scalable technique that uses a regularized ensemble to approximate a deep BNN. We conduct a series of active learning experiments to evaluate DPEs on classification with the CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100 and ImageNet datasets, and semantic segmentation with the BDD100k dataset. Our models consistently outperform baselines and previously published methods, requiring significantly less training data to achieve competitive performances.
