##### Abstract
In perfusion analysis automated approaches for image processing is preferable due to reduce time-consuming tasks for radiologists. Assessment of perfusion results quality is important step in development of algorithms for automated processing. One of them is an assessment of perfusion maps quality based on detection of perfusion ROI.
