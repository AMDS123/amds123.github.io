##### Abstract
Discriminating lung nodules as malignant or benign is still an underlying challenge. To address this challenge, radiologists need computer aided diagnosis (CAD) systems which can assist in learning discriminative imaging features corresponding to malignant and benign nodules. However, learning highly discriminative imaging features is an open problem. In this paper, our aim is to learn the most discriminative features pertaining to lung nodules by using an adversarial learning methodology. Specifically, we propose to use unsupervised learning with Deep Convolutional-Generative Adversarial Networks (DC-GANs) to generate lung nodule samples realistically. We hypothesize that imaging features of lung nodules will be discriminative if it is hard to differentiate them (fake) from real (true) nodules. To test this hypothesis, we present Visual Turing tests to two radiologists in order to evaluate the quality of the generated (fake) nodules. Extensive comparisons are performed in discerning real, generated, benign, and malignant nodules. This experimental set up allows us to validate the overall quality of the generated nodules, which can then be used to (1) improve diagnostic decisions by mining highly discriminative imaging features, (2) train radiologists for educational purposes, and (3) generate realistic samples to train deep networks with big data.
