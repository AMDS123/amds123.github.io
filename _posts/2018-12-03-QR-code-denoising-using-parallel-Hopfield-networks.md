##### Abstract
We propose a novel algorithm for using Hopfield networks to denoise QR codes. Hopfield networks have mostly been used as a noise tolerant memory or to solve difficult combinatorial problems. One of the major drawbacks in their use in noise tolerant associative memory is their low capacity of storage, scaling only linearly with the number of nodes in the network. A larger capacity therefore requires a larger number of nodes, thereby reducing the speed of convergence of the network in addition to increasing hardware costs for acquiring more precise data to be fed to a larger number of nodes. Our paper proposes a new algorithm to allow the use of several Hopfield networks in parallel thereby increasing the cumulative storage capacity of the system many times as compared to a single Hopfield network. Our algorithm would also be much faster than a larger single Hopfield network with the same total capacity. This enables their use in applications like denoising QR codes, which we have demonstrated in our paper. We then test our network on a large set of QR code images with different types of noise and demonstrate that such a system of Hopfield networks can be used to denoise and recognize QR codes in real time.
