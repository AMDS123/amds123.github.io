##### Abstract
Applying Machine Learning (ML) techniques to design and optimize computer architectures is a promising research direction. Optimizing the runtime performance of a Network-on-Chip (NoC) necessitates a continuous learning framework. In this work, we demonstrate the promise of applying reinforcement learning (RL) to optimize NoC runtime performance. We present three RL-based methods for learning optimal routing algorithms. The experimental results show the algorithms can successfully learn a near-optimal solution across different environment states. Reproducible Code: github.com/huckiyang/interconnect-routing-gym
