##### Abstract
This paper presents a comprehensive review on regression-based method for human pose estimation. The problem of human pose estimation has been intensively studied and enabled many application from entertainment to training. Traditional methods often rely on color image only which cannot completely ambiguity of joint 3D position, especially in the complex context. With the popularity of depth sensors, the precision of 3D estimation has significant improvement. In this paper, we give a detailed analysis of state-of-the-art on human pose estimation, including depth image based and RGB-D based approaches. The experimental results demonstrate their advantages and limitation for different scenarios.

本文提出了一种基于回归的人体姿态估计方法综述。人体姿态估计的问题已经被深入研究，使得从娱乐到训练的许多应用成为可能。传统的方法往往只依赖于彩色图像，而不能完全模糊三维立体位置，特别是在复杂的情况下。随着深度传感器的普及，3D估计的精度有了显着提高。在本文中，我们详细分析了人类姿态估计的最新进展，包括基于深度图像和基于RGB-D的方法。实验结果证明了它们在不同场景下的优势和局限性。
