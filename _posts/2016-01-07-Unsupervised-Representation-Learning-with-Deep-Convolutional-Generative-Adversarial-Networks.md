##### Abstract
In recent years, supervised learning with convolutional networks (CNNs) has seen huge adoption in computer vision applications. Comparatively, unsupervised learning with CNNs has received less attention. In this work we hope to help bridge the gap between the success of CNNs for supervised learning and unsupervised learning. We introduce a class of CNNs called deep convolutional generative adversarial networks (DCGANs), that have certain architectural constraints, and demonstrate that they are a strong candidate for unsupervised learning. Training on various image datasets, we show convincing evidence that our deep convolutional adversarial pair learns a hierarchy of representations from object parts to scenes in both the generator and discriminator. Additionally, we use the learned features for novel tasks - demonstrating their applicability as general image representations.

近年来，卷积网络（CNN）的监督学习在计算机视觉应用中得到了广泛的应用。相比之下，无监督的CNN学习受到的关注较少。在这项工作中，我们希望能够帮助弥合有监督学习的CNN成功和无监督学习之间的差距。我们引入了一类称为深度卷积生成对抗网络（CNG），它具有一定的架构约束，表明它们是非监督学习的有力候选。训练各种图像数据集，我们展示令人信服的证据表明，我们的深层卷积对抗学习从对象部分到发生器和鉴别器中的场景的表示层次。此外，我们使用学习的功能进行新的任务 - 证明它们作为一般图像表示的适用性。
