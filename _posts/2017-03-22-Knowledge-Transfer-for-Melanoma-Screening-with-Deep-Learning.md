##### Abstract
Knowledge transfer impacts the performance of deep learning -- the state of the art for image classification tasks, including automated melanoma screening. Deep learning's greed for large amounts of training data poses a challenge for medical tasks, which we can alleviate by recycling knowledge from models trained on different tasks, in a scheme called transfer learning. Although much of the best art on automated melanoma screening employs some form of transfer learning, a systematic evaluation was missing. Here we investigate the presence of transfer, from which task the transfer is sourced, and the application of fine tuning (i.e., retraining of the deep learning model after transfer). We also test the impact of picking deeper (and more expensive) models. Our results favor deeper models, pre-trained over ImageNet, with fine-tuning, reaching an AUC of 80.7% and 84.5% for the two skin-lesion datasets evaluated.

知识转移影响深度学习的表现 - 图像分类任务的技术水平，包括自动黑素瘤筛查。深度学习对大量训练数据的贪婪对医疗任务提出了挑战，我们可以通过回收利用不同任务训练的模型中的知识来减轻这个问题。虽然自动黑素瘤筛查最好的艺术大部分采用某种形式的转移学习，但系统评价失踪。在这里，我们调查转移的存在，转移来自哪个任务，以及微调的应用（即转移后的深度学习模型的再训练）。我们也测试挑选更深（和更昂贵）模型的影响。我们的研究结果支持更深层次的模型，在ImageNet上进行预先训练，进行微调，评估的两个皮肤损伤数据集的AUC分别达到80.7％和84.5％。
