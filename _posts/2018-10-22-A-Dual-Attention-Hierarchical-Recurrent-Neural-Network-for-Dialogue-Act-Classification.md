##### Abstract
Recognising dialogue acts (DA) is important for many natural language processing tasks such as dialogue generation and intention recognition. In this paper, we propose a dual-attention hierarchical recurrent neural network for dialogue act classification. Our model is partially inspired by the observation that conversational utterances are normally associated with both a dialogue act and a topic, where the former captures the social act and the latter describes the subject matter. However, such a dependency between dialogue acts and topics has not been utilised by most existing systems for DA classification. With a novel dual task-specific attention mechanism, our model is able, for utterances, to capture information about both dialogue acts and topics, as well as information about the interactions between them. We evaluate the performance of our model on two publicly available datasets, i.e., Switchboard and DailyDialog. Experimental results show that by modelling topic as an auxiliary task, our model can significantly improve DA classification.
