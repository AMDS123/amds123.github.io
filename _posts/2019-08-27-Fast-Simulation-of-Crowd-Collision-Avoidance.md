##### Abstract
Real-time large-scale crowd simulations with realistic behavior, are important for many application areas. On CPUs, the ORCA pedestrian steering model is often used for agent-based pedestrian simulations. This paper introduces a technique for running the ORCA pedestrian steering model on the GPU. Performance improvements of up to 30 times greater than a multi-core CPU model are demonstrated. This improvement is achieved through a specialized linear program solver on the GPU and spatial partitioning of information sharing. This allows over 100,000 people to be simulated in real time (60 frames per second).
