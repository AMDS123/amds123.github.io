##### Abstract
The task of graph classification is currently dominated by graph kernels, which, while powerful, scale poorly to large graphs and datasets. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) offer a very appealing alternative. However, feeding graphs to CNNs is not trivial. To address this challenge, many sophisticated extensions of CNNs have recently been proposed. In this paper, we show that a classical 2D CNN architecture designed for images can also be used for graph processing in a completely off-the-shelf manner; the only prerequisite being to encode graphs as stacks of two-dimensional histograms of their node embeddings. Despite its simplicity, our method proves very competitive to state-of-the-art graph kernels, and even outperforms them by a wide margin on some datasets.

图分类的任务目前由图核所控制，虽然功能强大，但对大图和数据集的缩放比较差。卷积神经网络（CNN）提供了一个非常吸引人的选择。然而，向CNNs提供图表并不是微不足道的。为了应对这一挑战，最近有人提出了CNN的许多复杂的扩展。在本文中，我们展示了为图像设计的经典2D CNN体系结构也可以以完全现成的方式用于图形处理;唯一的先决条件是将图表编码为其节点嵌入的二维直方图的堆栈。尽管它的简单性，我们的方法证明了对于最先进的图形内核非常有竞争力，甚至在一些数据集上大大优于它们。
