##### Abstract
While several approaches to face emotion recognition task are proposed in literature, none of them reports on power consumption nor inference time required to run the system in an embedded environment. Without adequate knowledge about these factors it is not clear whether we are actually able to provide accurate face emotion recognition in the embedded environment or not, and if not, how far we are from making it feasible and what are the biggest bottlenecks we face. 
 The main goal of this paper is to answer these questions and to convey the message that instead of reporting only detection accuracy also power consumption and inference time should be reported as real usability of the proposed systems and their adoption in human computer interaction strongly depends on it. In this paper, we identify the state-of-the art face emotion recognition methods that are potentially suitable for embedded environment and the most frequently used datasets for this task. Our study shows that most of the performed experiments use datasets with posed expressions or in a particular experimental setup with special conditions for image collection. Since our goal is to evaluate the performance of the identified promising methods in the realistic scenario, we collect a new dataset with non-exaggerated emotions and we use it, in addition to the publicly available datasets, for the evaluation of detection accuracy, power consumption and inference time on three frequently used embedded devices with different computational capabilities. Our results show that gray images are still more suitable for embedded environment than color ones and that for most of the analyzed systems either inference time or energy consumption or both are limiting factor for their adoption in real-life embedded applications.

##### Abstract (translated by Google)
虽然在文献中提出了几种面对情感识别任务的方法，但它们都没有报告在嵌入式环境中运行系统所需的功耗和推理时间。如果对这些因素缺乏足够的了解，我们是否真的能够在嵌入式环境中提供准确的面部情感识别，如果没有，我们能够在多大程度上使其可行以及我们面临的最大瓶颈是不明确的。
 本文的主要目的是回答这些问题并传达这样的信息，即不仅仅报告检测准确度，而且应该将功耗和推理时间报告为所提出系统的实际可用性，并且它们在人机交互中的采用强烈依赖于它。在本文中，我们确定了最适合嵌入式环境的最先进的人脸情感识别方法，以及此任务最常用的数据集。我们的研究表明，大多数执行的实验都使用带有表达式的数据集，或者在具有特殊条件的特定实验装置中进行图像采集。由于我们的目标是在现实场景中评估已识别的有前途方法的性能，我们收集一个具有非夸大情绪的新数据集，除了公开可用的数据集之外，我们还使用它来评估检测准确度，功耗和三个常用的具有不同计算能力的嵌入式设备的推理时间。我们的结果表明，灰度图像仍然比彩色图像更适合嵌入式环境，对于大多数分析系统而言，推理时间或能耗或两者都是在现实嵌入式应用中采用的限制因素。
