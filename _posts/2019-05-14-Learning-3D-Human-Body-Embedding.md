##### Abstract
Although human body shapes vary for different identities with different poses, they can be embedded into a low-dimensional space due to their similarity in structure. Inspired by the recent work on latent representation learning with a deformation-based mesh representation, we propose an autoencoder like network architecture to learn disentangled shape and pose embedding specifically for 3D human body. We also integrate a coarse-to-fine reconstruction pipeline into the disentangling process to improve the reconstruction accuracy. Moreover, we construct a large dataset of human body models with consistent topology for the learning of neural network. Our learned embedding can achieve not only superior reconstruction accuracy but also provide great flexibilities in 3D human body creations via interpolation, bilateral interpolation and latent space sampling, which is confirmed by extensive experiments. The constructed dataset and trained model will be made publicly available.
