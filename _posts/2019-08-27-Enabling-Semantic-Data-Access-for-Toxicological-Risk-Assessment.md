##### Abstract
Experimental effort and animal welfare are concerns when exploring the effects a compound has on an organism. Appropriate methods for extrapolating chemical effects can further mitigate these challenges. In this paper we present the efforts to (i) (pre)process and gather data from public and private sources, varying from tabular files to SPARQL endpoints, (ii) integrate the data and represent them as a knowledge graph with richer semantics. This knowledge graph is further applied to facilitate the retrieval of the relevant data for a ecological risk assessment task, extrapolation of effect data, where two prediction techniques are developed.
