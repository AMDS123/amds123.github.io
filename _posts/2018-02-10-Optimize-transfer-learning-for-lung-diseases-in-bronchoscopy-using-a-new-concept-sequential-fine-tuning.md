##### Abstract
Bronchoscopy inspection as a follow-up procedure from the radiological imaging plays a key role in lung disease diagnosis and determining treatment plans for the patients. Doctors needs to make a decision whether to biopsy the patients timely when performing bronchoscopy. However, the doctors also needs to be very selective with biopsies as biopsies may cause uncontrollable bleeding of the lung tissue which is life-threaten. To help doctors to be more selective on biopsies and provide a second opinion on diagnosis, in this work, we propose a computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) system for lung diseases including cancers and tuberculosis (TB). The system is developed based on transfer learning. We propose a novel transfer learning method: sentential fine-tuning . Compared to traditional fine-tuning methods, our methods achieves the best performance. We obtained a overall accuracy of 77.0% a dataset of 81 normal cases, 76 tuberculosis cases and 277 lung cancer cases while the other traditional transfer learning methods achieve an accuracy of 73% and 68%. . The detection accuracy of our method for cancers, TB and normal cases are 87%, 54% and 91% respectively. This indicates that the CAD system has potential to improve lung disease diagnosis accuracy in bronchoscopy and it also might be used to be more selective with biopsies.

支气管镜检查作为放射成像的后续程序在肺病诊断和确定患者的治疗计划中起着关键作用。在进行支气管镜检查时，医生需要做出是否对患者进行及时活检的决定。但是，医生还需要对活检进行非常有选择性的活检，因为活检可能会导致无法控制的对生命构成威胁的肺组织出血。为了帮助医生对活检进行更多选择并提供第二个诊断意见，本文中，我们提出了一个计算机辅助诊断（CAD）系统，用于包括癌症和结核病（TB）在内的肺部疾病。该系统是基于转移学习开发的。我们提出了一种新的转移学习方法：句子微调。与传统的微调方法相比，我们的方法达到最佳性能。我们对81例正常病例，76例肺结核病例和277例肺癌病例的总体准确率为77.0％，而其他传统学习方法的准确率为73％和68％。 。我们的方法对癌症，结核病和正常病例的检测准确率分别为87％，54％和91％。这表明CAD系统有可能提高支气管镜检查中肺部疾病诊断的准确性，并且可能用于活检更具选择性。
