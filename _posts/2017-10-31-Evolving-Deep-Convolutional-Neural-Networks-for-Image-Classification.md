##### Abstract
Evolutionary computation methods have been successfully applied to neural networks since two decades ago, while those methods cannot scale well to the modern deep neural networks due to the complicated architectures and large quantities of connection weights. In this paper, we propose a new method using genetic algorithms for evolving the architectures and connection weight initialization values of a deep convolutional neural network to address image classification problems. In the proposed algorithm, an efficient variable-length gene encoding strategy is designed to represent the different building blocks and the unpredictable optimal depth in convolutional neural networks. In addition, a new representation scheme is developed for effectively initializing connection weights of deep convolutional neural networks, which is expected to avoid networks getting stuck into local minima which is typically a major issue in the backward gradient-based optimization. Furthermore, a novel fitness evaluation method is proposed to speed up the heuristic search with substantially less computational resource. The proposed algorithm is examined and compared with 22 existing algorithms on nine widely used image classification tasks, including the state-of-the-art methods. The experimental results demonstrate the remarkable superiority of the proposed algorithm over the state-of-the-art algorithms in terms of classification error rate and the number of parameters (weights).

##### Abstract (translated by Google)
进化计算方法自二十年前就已经成功应用于神经网络，但由于结构复杂，连接权重大，这些方法不能很好地适应现代深度神经网络。在本文中，我们提出了一种新的方法，利用遗传算法来演化深度卷积神经网络的体系结构和连接权重初始值，以解决图像分类问题。在所提出的算法中，设计了一种高效的变长编码策略来表征卷积神经网络中不同的构件块和不可预知的最优深度。另外，为了有效地初始化深度卷积神经网络的连接权重，开发了一种新的表示方案，期望避免网络陷入局部最小值，这通常是后向梯度优化中的主要问题。此外，还提出了一种新的适应性评估方法，以加速启发式搜索，而且计算资源相当少。提出的算法进行了检查，并与9个广泛使用的图像分类任务，包括最先进的方法22现有算法进行比较。实验结果证明了所提出的算法在分类错误率和参数个数（权重）方面优于现有算法的显着优越性。
