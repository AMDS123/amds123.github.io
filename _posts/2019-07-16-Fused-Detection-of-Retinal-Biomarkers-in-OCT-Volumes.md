##### Abstract
Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) is the primary imaging modality for detecting pathological biomarkers associated to retinal diseases such as Age-Related Macular Degeneration. In practice, clinical diagnosis and treatment strategies are closely linked to biomarkers visible in OCT volumes and the ability to identify these plays an important role in the development of ophthalmic pharmaceutical products. In this context, we present a method that automatically predicts the presence of biomarkers in OCT cross-sections by incorporating information from the entire volume. We do so by adding a bidirectional LSTM to fuse the outputs of a Convolutional Neural Network that predicts individual biomarkers. We thus avoid the need to use pixel-wise annotations to train our method, and instead provide fine-grained biomarker information regardless. On a dataset of 416 volumes, we show that our approach imposes coherence between biomarker predictions across volume slices and our predictions are superior to several existing approaches.
