##### Abstract
Detection of double JPEG compression is important to forensics analysis. A few methods were proposed based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs). These methods only accept inputs from pre-processed data, such as histogram features and/or decompressed images. In this paper, we present a CNN solution by using raw DCT (discrete cosine transformation) coefficients from JPEG images as input. Considering the DCT sub-band nature in JPEG, a multiple-branch CNN structure has been designed to reveal whether a JPEG format image has been doubly compressed. Comparing with previous methods, the proposed method provides end-to-end detection capability. Extensive experiments have been carried out to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed network.

双重JPEG压缩的检测对于取证分析非常重要。基于卷积神经网络（CNNs）提出了几种方法。这些方法只接受来自预处理数据的输入，例如直方图特征和/或解压缩图像。在本文中，我们通过使用来自JPEG图像的原始DCT（离散余弦变换）系数作为输入来提出CNN解决方案。考虑到JPEG中的DCT子带性质，设计了多分支CNN结构以揭示JPEG格式图像是否已被双重压缩。与以前的方法相比，所提出的方法提供了端到端的检测能力。已经进行了大量的实验来证明所提出的网络的有效性。
