##### Abstract
We consider dimensionality reduction methods for face recognition in a supervised setting, using an image-as-matrix representation. A common procedure is to project image matrices into a smaller space in which the recognition is performed. These methods are often called "two-dimensional" in the literature and there exist counterparts that use an image-as-vector representation. When two face images are close to each other in the input space they may remain close after projection - but this is not desirable in the situation when these two images are from different classes, and this often affects the recognition performance. We extend a previously developed `repulsion Laplacean' technique based on adding terms to the objective function with the goal or creation a repulsion energy between such images in the projected space. This scheme, which relies on a repulsion graph, is generic and can be incorporated into various two-dimensional methods. It can be regarded as a multilinear generalization of the repulsion strategy by Kokiopoulou and Saad [Pattern Recog., 42 (2009), pp. 2392--2402]. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed methodology offers significant recognition improvement relative to the underlying two-dimensional methods.

我们考虑在监督设置下的面部识别的降维方法，使用图像矩阵表示。一个普通的过程是将图像矩阵投影到一个更小的空间，在这个空间中进行识别。这些方法在文献中通常被称为“二维”，并且存在使用图像作为矢量表示的对应物。当两个人脸图像在输入空间上彼此靠近时，它们在投影之后可能保持紧密，但是当这两个图像来自不同的类别时，这是不可取的，这经常影响识别性能。我们扩展了以前开发的`斥力拉普拉斯（Laplacean）'技术，该技术是基于在目标函数中添加项来实现的，或者是在投影空间中创建这种图像之间的斥力能量。这种依赖于排斥图的方案是通用的，并且可以结合到各种二维方法中。它可以被认为是Kokiopoulou和Saad的排斥策略的多线性推广[Pattern Recog。，42（2009），pp.2392-2402]。实验结果表明，相对于基础的二维方法，所提出的方法提供了显着的识别改进。
