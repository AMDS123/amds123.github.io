##### Abstract
Ethnicity is a key demographic attribute of human beings and it plays a vital role in automatic facial recognition and have extensive real world applications such as Human Computer Interaction (HCI); demographic based classification; biometric based recognition; security and defense to name a few. In this paper we present a novel approach for extracting ethnicity from the facial images. The proposed method makes use of a pre trained Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to extract the features and then Support Vector Machine (SVM) with linear kernel is used as a classifier. This technique uses translational invariant hierarchical features learned by the network, in contrast to previous works, which use hand crafted features such as Local Binary Pattern (LBP); Gabor etc. Thorough experiments are presented on ten different facial databases which strongly suggest that our approach is robust to different expressions and illuminations conditions. Here we consider ethnicity classification as a three class problem including Asian, African-American and Caucasian. Average classification accuracy over all databases is 98.28%, 99.66% and 99.05% for Asian, African-American and Caucasian respectively.

种族是人类的重要人口属性，在自动面部识别中起着至关重要的作用，并具有广泛的现实世界应用，如人机交互（HCI）;基于人口统计的分类;基于生物识别的识别;安全和防御等等。在本文中，我们提出了一种从面部图像中提取种族的新方法。该方法利用预先训练的卷积神经网络（CNN）提取特征，然后用线性核的支持向量机（Support Vector Machine，SVM）作为分类器。这种技术使用了网络学习的平移不变分层特征，与之前使用手工特征（如局部二值模式（LBP））的作品相比， Gabor等。在十个不同的面部数据库上进行了彻底的实验，这强烈地暗示了我们的方法对于不同的表达和照明条件是强健的。在这里，我们将种族分类视为三类问题，包括亚洲，非裔美国人和高加索人。亚洲，非裔美国人和高加索人的所有数据库的平均分类准确率分别为98.28％，99.66％和99.05％。
