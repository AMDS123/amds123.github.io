##### Abstract
One of the main difficulties in sentiment analysis of the Arabic language is the presence of the colloquialism. In this paper, we examine the effect of using objective words in conjunction with sentimental words on sentiment classification for the colloquial Arabic reviews, specifically Jordanian colloquial reviews. The reviews often include both sentimental and objective words, however, the most existing sentiment analysis models ignore the objective words as they are considered useless. In this work, we created two lexicons: the first includes the colloquial sentimental words and compound phrases, while the other contains the objective words associated with values of sentiment tendency based on a particular estimation method. We used these lexicons to extract sentiment features that would be training input to the Support Vector Machines (SVM) to classify the sentiment polarity of the reviews. The reviews dataset have been collected manually from JEERAN website. The results of the experiments show that the proposed approach improves the polarity classification in comparison to two baseline models, with accuracy 95.6%.

对阿拉伯语进行情感分析的主要困难之一是口语化的存在。在本文中，我们考察了用客观词语和情感词语对阿拉伯口语评论情感分类的影响，特别是约旦口语评论。评论往往包括情感和客观两方面的话语，然而，大多数现有的情感分析模型忽略了客观的词语，因为它们被认为是无用的。在这项工作中，我们创造了两个词汇：第一个包括口语情感词汇和复合词组，另一个包含基于特定估计方法的与情感倾向值相关的客观词汇。我们使用这些词典来提取将作为支持向量机（SVM）的训练输入的情感特征，以对评论的情感极性进行分类。评论数据集已经从JEERAN网站手动收集。实验结果表明，与两个基线模型相比，所提出的方法改善了极性分类，准确率为95.6％。
