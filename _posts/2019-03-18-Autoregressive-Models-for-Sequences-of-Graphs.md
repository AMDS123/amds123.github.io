##### Abstract
This paper proposes an autoregressive (AR) model for sequences of graphs, which generalises traditional AR models. A first novelty consists in formalising the AR model for a very general family of graphs, characterised by a variable topology, and attributes associated with nodes and edges. A graph neural network (GNN) is also proposed to learn the AR function associated with the graph-generating process (GGP), and subsequently predict the next graph in a sequence. The proposed method is compared with four baselines on synthetic GGPs, denoting a significantly better performance on all considered problems.
