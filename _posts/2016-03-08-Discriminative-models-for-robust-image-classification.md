##### Abstract
A variety of real-world tasks involve the classification of images into pre-determined categories. Designing image classification algorithms that exhibit robustness to acquisition noise and image distortions, particularly when the available training data are insufficient to learn accurate models, is a significant challenge. This dissertation explores the development of discriminative models for robust image classification that exploit underlying signal structure, via probabilistic graphical models and sparse signal representations. Probabilistic graphical models are widely used in many applications to approximate high-dimensional data in a reduced complexity set-up. Learning graphical structures to approximate probability distributions is an area of active research. Recent work has focused on learning graphs in a discriminative manner with the goal of minimizing classification error. In the first part of the dissertation, we develop a discriminative learning framework that exploits the complementary yet correlated information offered by multiple representations (or projections) of a given signal/image. Specifically, we propose a discriminative tree-based scheme for feature fusion by explicitly learning the conditional correlations among such multiple projections in an iterative manner. Experiments reveal the robustness of the resulting graphical model classifier to training insufficiency.

各种现实世界的任务涉及将图像分类为预定类别。设计对采集噪声和图像失真具有鲁棒性的图像分类算法，特别是当可用训练数据不足以学习精确模型时，是一个重大挑战。本文探讨了利用概率图模型和稀疏信号表示来挖掘潜在信号结构的鲁棒图像分类判别模型的发展。概率图形模型在许多应用中被广泛使用，以简化的复杂设置逼近高维数据。学习图形结构来近似概率分布是一个积极的研究领域。最近的工作集中在以最小化分类错误为目标的歧视性学习图表。在论文的第一部分，我们开发了一个歧视性的学习框架，利用由给定的信号/图像的多个表示（或投影）提供的互补而相关的信息。具体而言，我们提出了一种基于判别树的特征融合方案，通过迭代的方式显式地学习这种多重投影之间的条件相关性。实验揭示了由此产生的图形模型分类器训练不足的稳健性。
