##### Abstract
We show that GdN nanoislands can enhance inter-band tunneling in GaN PN junctions by several orders of magnitude, enabling low optical absorption low-resistance tunnel junctions (specific resistivity 1.3 X 10-3 {\Omega}-cm2) for various optoelectronic applications. We exploit the ability to overgrow high quality GaN over GdN nanoislands to create new nanoscale heterostructure designs that are not feasible in planar epitaxy. GdN nanoisland assisted inter-band tunneling was found to enhance tunneling in both of the polar orientations of GaN. Tunnel injection of holes was confirmed by low temperature operation of GaN p-n junction with a tunneling contact layer, showing strong electroluminescence down to 20K. The availability of tunnel junctions with negligible absorption could not only improve the efficiency of existing optoelectronic devices significantly, but also enable new electronic and optical devices based on wide band gap materials.
