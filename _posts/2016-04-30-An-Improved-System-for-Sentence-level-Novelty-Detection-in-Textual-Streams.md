##### Abstract
Novelty detection in news events has long been a difficult problem. A number of models performed well on specific data streams but certain issues are far from being solved, particularly in large data streams from the WWW where unpredictability of new terms requires adaptation in the vector space model. We present a novel event detection system based on the Incremental Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) weighting incorporated with Locality Sensitive Hashing (LSH). Our system could efficiently and effectively adapt to the changes within the data streams of any new terms with continual updates to the vector space model. Regarding miss probability, our proposed novelty detection framework outperforms a recognised baseline system by approximately 16% when evaluating a benchmark dataset from Google News.

##### Abstract (translated by Google)
新闻事件中的新奇性检测一直是一个难题。一些模型在特定的数据流上表现良好，但某些问题还远远没有得到解决，尤其是在WWW的大量数据流中，新术语的不可预测性要求在向量空间模型中进行适应。我们提出了一种基于增量项频率逆文档频率（TF-IDF）加权与局部敏感散列（LSH）的新型事件检测系统。我们的系统可以有效地适应任何新术语的数据流内的变化，并不断更新矢量空间模型。关于失败概率，我们提出的新颖性检测框架在评估Google新闻的基准数据集时，其性能比公认的基准系统高出大约16％。
