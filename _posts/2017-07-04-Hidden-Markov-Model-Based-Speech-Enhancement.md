##### Abstract
The goal of this contribution is to use a parametric speech synthesis system for reducing background noise and other interferences from recorded speech signals. In a first step, Hidden Markov Models of the synthesis system are trained. Two adequate training corpora consisting of text and corresponding speech files have been set up and cleared of various faults, including inaudible utterances or incorrect assignments between audio and text data. Those are tested and compared against each other regarding e.g. flaws in the synthesized speech, it's naturalness and intelligibility. Thus different voices have been synthesized, whose quality depends less on the number of training samples used, but much more on the cleanliness and signal-to-noise ratio of those. Generalized voice models have been used for synthesis and the results greatly differ between the two speech corpora. Tests regarding the adaptation to different speakers show that a resemblance to the original speaker is audible throughout all recordings, yet the synthesized voices sound robotic and unnatural in smaller parts. The spoken text, however, is usually intelligible, which shows that the models are working well. In a novel approach, speech is synthesized using side information of the original audio signal, particularly the pitch frequency. Results show an increase of speech quality and intelligibility in comparison to speech synthesized solely from text, up to the point of being nearly indistinguishable from the original.

该贡献的目标是使用参数语音合成系统来减少来自记录的语音信号的背景噪声和其他干扰。第一步，合成系统的隐马尔可夫模型被训练。已经建立了由文本和相应的语音文件组成的两个适当的训练语料库，并清除各种错误，包括听不到的话语或音频和文本数据之间的不正确的分配。对这些进行测试并相互比较，例如，合成语音中的缺陷，它的自然性和可理解性。因此，已经合成了不同的声音，其质量取决于使用的训练样本的数量，但更多地取决于这些样本的清洁度和信噪比。广义的语音模型已经被用于合成，两个语音语料库之间的结果差别很大。关于适应不同演讲者的测试表明，与原始演讲者的相似性在所有录音中都是可听的，然而合成的声音在较小的部分听起来机器人和不自然。然而，口头文本通常是可以理解的，这表明模型运行良好。在一种新颖的方法中，使用原始音频信号的边信息，特别是音调频率来合成语音。结果表明，与仅从文本合成的语音相比，语音质量和可理解性增加，直到与原始文本几乎没有区别。
