##### Abstract
This paper demonstrates emergence of computational creativity in the field of music. Different aspects of creativity such as producer, process, product and press are studied and formulated. Different notions of computational creativity such as novelty, quality and typicality of compositions as products are studied and evaluated. We formulate an algorithmic perception on human creativity and propose a prototype that is capable of demonstrating human-level creativity. We then validate the proposed prototype by applying various creativity benchmarks with the results obtained and compare the proposed prototype with the other existing computational creative systems.
