##### Abstract
In this paper we examine the benefit of performing named entity recognition (NER) and co-reference resolution to an English and a Greek corpus used for text segmentation. The aim here is to examine whether the combination of text segmentation and information extraction can be beneficial for the identification of the various topics that appear in a document. NER was performed manually in the English corpus and was compared with the output produced by publicly available annotation tools while, an already existing tool was used for the Greek corpus. Produced annotations from both corpora were manually corrected and enriched to cover four types of named entities. Co-reference resolution i.e., substitution of every reference of the same instance with the same named entity identifier was subsequently performed. The evaluation, using five text segmentation algorithms for the English corpus and four for the Greek corpus leads to the conclusion that, the benefit highly depends on the segment's topic, the number of named entity instances appearing in it, as well as the segment's length.

在本文中，我们研究了对用于文本分割的英语和希腊语语料库执行命名实体识别（NER）和共同参考解析的好处。这里的目的是检查文本分割和信息提取的组合是否有利于识别出现在文档中的各种主题。 NER在英语语料库中手动执行，并与公开可用的注释工具产生的输出进行比较，而希腊语语料库使用了现有的工具。从两个语料库产生的注释是手动更正和丰富，涵盖四种类型的命名实体。随后执行共同参考分辨率，即用相同的命名实体标识符替换相同实例的每个参考。评估中，使用英文语料库的五种文本分割算法和希腊语料库的四种文本分割算法得出的结论是，好处高度依赖于分段的主题，出现在其中的命名实体实例的数目以及分段的长度。
