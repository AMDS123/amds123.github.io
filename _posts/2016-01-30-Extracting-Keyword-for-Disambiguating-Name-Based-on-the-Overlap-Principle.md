The semantic web is an extension of the current Web in which information is not only given well-defined meaning, but also has many purposes that contain the ambiguous naturally or a lot of thing came with the overlap, mainly deals with the persons name. Therefore, we develop an approach to extract keywords from web snippet with utilizing the overlap principle, a concept to understand things with ambiguous, whereby features of person are generated for dealing with the variety of web, the web is steadily gaining ground in the semantic research.
