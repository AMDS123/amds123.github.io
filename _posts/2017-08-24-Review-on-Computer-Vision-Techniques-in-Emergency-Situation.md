##### Abstract
In emergency situations, actions that save lives and limit the impact of hazards are crucial. In order to act, situational awareness is needed to decide what to do. Geolocalized photos and video of the situations as they evolve can be crucial in better understanding them and making decisions faster. Cameras are almost everywhere these days, either in terms of smartphones, installed CCTV cameras, UAVs or others. However, this poses challenges in big data and information overflow. Moreover, most of the time there are no disasters at any given location, so humans aiming to detect sudden situations may not be as alert as needed at any point in time. Consequently, computer vision tools can be an excellent decision support. The number of emergencies where computer vision tools has been considered or used is very wide, and there is a great overlap across related emergency research. Researchers tend to focus on state-of-the-art systems that cover the same emergency as they are studying, obviating important research in other fields. In order to unveil this overlap, the survey is divided along four main axes: the types of emergencies that have been studied in computer vision, the objective that the algorithms can address, the type of hardware needed and the algorithms used. Therefore, this review provides a broad overview of the progress of computer vision covering all sorts of emergencies.

在紧急情况下，拯救生命和限制危害影响的行动至关重要。为了采取行动，需要形势认知来决定做什么。地理定位的照片和视频随着情况的演变对于更好地理解和更快地做出决定至关重要。无论是在智能手机，已安装的闭路电视摄像机，无人机或其他设备方面，照相机几乎都是无处不在的。但是，这对大数据和信息溢出带来了挑战。而且，大多数情况下，在任何地方都没有灾难，因此人类在任何时候都可能没有足够的警觉。因此，计算机视觉工具可以成为出色的决策支持。计算机视觉工具被考虑或使用的紧急情况非常广泛，相关的应急研究有很大的重叠。研究人员倾向于关注覆盖与他们研究相同的紧急情况的最先进的系统，从而避免在其他领域进行重要的研究。为了揭示这种重叠，调查分四个主要方向：计算机视觉中研究的紧急情况的类型，算法可以处理的目标，所需的硬件类型以及所使用的算法。因此，这次审查提供了一个覆盖各种紧急情况的计算机视觉的进展的广泛的概述。
