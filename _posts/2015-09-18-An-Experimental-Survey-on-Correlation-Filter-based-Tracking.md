##### Abstract
Over these years, Correlation Filter-based Trackers (CFTs) have aroused increasing interests in the field of visual object tracking, and have achieved extremely compelling results in different competitions and benchmarks. In this paper, our goal is to review the developments of CFTs with extensive experimental results. 11 trackers are surveyed in our work, based on which a general framework is summarized. Furthermore, we investigate different training schemes for correlation filters, and also discuss various effective improvements that have been made recently. Comprehensive experiments have been conducted to evaluate the effectiveness and efficiency of the surveyed CFTs, and comparisons have been made with other competing trackers. The experimental results have shown that state-of-art performance, in terms of robustness, speed and accuracy, can be achieved by several recent CFTs, such as MUSTer and SAMF. We find that further improvements for correlation filter-based tracking can be made on estimating scales, applying part-based tracking strategy and cooperating with long-term tracking methods.

这些年来，相关滤波器跟踪器（CFTs）在视觉对象跟踪领域引起了越来越多的兴趣，在不同的竞争和基准测试中取得了非常令人满意的结果。在本文中，我们的目标是通过广泛的实验结果来回顾CFTs的发展。在我们的工作中对11位跟踪者进行了调查，总结了总体框架。此外，我们研究了不同的相关滤波器的训练方案，并且还讨论了最近已经做出的各种有效的改进。已经进行了全面的实验来评估被调查的CFT的有效性和效率，并且与其他竞争追踪者进行了比较。实验结果表明，在稳健性，速度和准确性方面，最新的性能可以通过最近的一些CFT（例如MUSTer和SAMF）来实现。我们发现进一步改进相关滤波器跟踪可以在估计尺度上，应用基于部分的跟踪策略和与长期跟踪方法配合。
