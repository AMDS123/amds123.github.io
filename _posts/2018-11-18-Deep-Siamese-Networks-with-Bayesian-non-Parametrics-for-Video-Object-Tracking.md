##### Abstract
We present a novel algorithm utilizing a deep Siamese neural network as a general object similarity function in combination with a Bayesian optimization (BO) framework to encode spatio-temporal information for efficient object tracking in video. In particular, we treat the video tracking problem as a dynamic (i.e. temporally-evolving) optimization problem. Using Gaussian Process priors, we model a dynamic objective function representing the location of a tracked object in each frame. By exploiting temporal correlations, the proposed method queries the search space in a statistically principled and efficient way, offering several benefits over current state of the art video tracking methods.
