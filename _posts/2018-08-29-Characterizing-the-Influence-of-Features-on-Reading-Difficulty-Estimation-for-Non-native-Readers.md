##### Abstract
In recent years, the number of people studying English as a second language (ESL) has surpassed the number of native speakers. Recent work have demonstrated the success of providing personalized content based on reading difficulty, such as information retrieval and summarization. However, almost all prior studies of reading difficulty are designed for native speakers, rather than non-native readers. In this study, we investigate various features for ESL readers, by conducting a linear regression to estimate the reading level of English language sources. This estimation is based not only on the complexity of lexical and syntactic features, but also several novel concepts, including the age of word and grammar acquisition from several sources, word sense from WordNet, and the implicit relation between sentences. By employing Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) to select the optimal model, we find that the combination of the number of words, the age of word acquisition and the height of the parsing tree generate better results than alternative competing models. Thus, our results show that proposed second language reading difficulty estimation outperforms other first language reading difficulty estimations.

近年来，学习英语作为第二语言（ESL）的人数已经超过了母语人士的数量。最近的工作已经证明了基于阅读困难提供个性化内容的成功，例如信息检索和摘要。然而，几乎所有先前的阅读困难研究都是针对母语人士而非非本地读者而设计的。在本研究中，我们通过线性回归来估计英语语言来源的阅读水平，从而研究ESL读者的各种特征。这种估计不仅基于词汇和句法特征的复杂性，而且还基于几个新概念，包括从几个来源获得的单词和语法习得的年龄，来自WordNet的单词意义，以及句子之间的隐含关系。通过使用贝叶斯信息准则（BIC）来选择最优模型，我们发现单词数量，单词获取年龄和解析树高度的组合比其他竞争模型产生更好的结果。因此，我们的结果表明，所提出的第二语言阅读难度估计优于其他第一语言阅读难度估计。
