##### Abstract
This paper considers the problem of autonomous multi-agent cooperative target search in an unknown environment using a decentralized framework under a no-communication scenario. The targets are considered as static targets and the agents are considered to be homogeneous. The no-communication scenario translates as the agents do not exchange either the information about the environment or their actions among themselves. We propose an integrated decision and control theoretic solution for a search problem which generates feasible agent trajectories. In particular, a perception based algorithm is proposed which allows an agent to estimate the probable strategies of other agents' and to choose a decision based on such estimation. The algorithm shows robustness with respect to the estimation accuracy to a certain degree. The performance of the algorithm is compared with random strategies and numerical simulation shows considerable advantages.

本文考虑了在无通信场景下使用分散框架的未知环境下的自主多智能体合作目标搜索问题。目标被视为静态目标，并且代理被认为是同质的。由于代理人之间不交换关于环境或他们的行为的信息，所以无通信情况转化。我们提出了一个综合的决策和控制理论解决方案的搜索问题，生成可行的代理轨迹。具体而言，提出了一种基于感知的算法，其允许代理人估计其他代理人的可能策略并基于这种估计来选择决策。该算法在一定程度上表现出对估计精度的鲁棒性。算法的性能与随机策略进行比较，数值模拟显示出相当大的优势。
