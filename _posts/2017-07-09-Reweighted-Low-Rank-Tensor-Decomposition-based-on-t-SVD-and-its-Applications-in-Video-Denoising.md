##### Abstract
The t-SVD based Tensor Robust Principal Component Analysis (TRPCA) decomposes low rank multi-linear signal corrupted by gross errors into low multi-rank and sparse component by simultaneously minimizing tensor nuclear norm and l 1 norm. But if the multi-rank of the signal is considerably large and/or large amount of noise is present, the performance of TRPCA deteriorates. To overcome this problem, this paper proposes a new efficient iterative reweighted tensor decomposition scheme based on t-SVD which significantly improves tensor multi-rank in TRPCA. Further, the sparse component of the tensor is also recovered by reweighted l 1 norm which enhances the accuracy of decomposition. The effectiveness of the proposed method is established by applying it to the video denoising problem and the experimental results reveal that the proposed algorithm outperforms its counterparts.

基于t-SVD的张量鲁棒主成分分析（TRPCA）通过同时最小化张量核范数和l 1范数，将受粗差错误影响的低秩多线性信号分解为低多重稀疏分量。但是，如果信号的多级大和/或存在大量的噪声，则TRPCA的性能恶化。针对这一问题，本文提出了一种基于t-SVD的高效迭代加权张量分解方法，大大提高了TRPCA中的张量多秩。此外，张量的稀疏分量也通过重新加权的l 1范数来恢复，这增强了分解的准确性。将该方法应用于视频去噪问题，证明了该方法的有效性，实验结果表明该算法优于同类算法。
