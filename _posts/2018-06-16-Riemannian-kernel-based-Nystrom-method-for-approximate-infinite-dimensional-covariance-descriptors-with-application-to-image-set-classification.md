##### Abstract
In the domain of pattern recognition, using the CovDs (Covariance Descriptors) to represent data and taking the metrics of the resulting Riemannian manifold into account have been widely adopted for the task of image set classification. Recently, it has been proven that infinite-dimensional CovDs are more discriminative than their low-dimensional counterparts. However, the form of infinite-dimensional CovDs is implicit and the computational load is high. We propose a novel framework for representing image sets by approximating infinite-dimensional CovDs in the paradigm of the Nystr\"om method based on a Riemannian kernel. We start by modeling the images via CovDs, which lie on the Riemannian manifold spanned by SPD (Symmetric Positive Definite) matrices. We then extend the Nystr\"om method to the SPD manifold and obtain the approximations of CovDs in RKHS (Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space). Finally, we approximate infinite-dimensional CovDs via these approximations. Empirically, we apply our framework to the task of image set classification. The experimental results obtained on three benchmark datasets show that our proposed approximate infinite-dimensional CovDs outperform the original CovDs.

在模式识别的领域中，使用CovDs（协方差描述符）来表示数据并考虑所产生的黎曼流形的度量被广泛用于图像集分类的任务。最近，已经证明无限维CovDs比它们的低维对应物更具有区别性。然而，无限维CovDs的形式是隐式的，计算量很大。我们提出了一种新颖的框架来表示图像集，通过在基于黎曼核的Nystrom方法的范例中近似无限维CovDs，我们首先通过CovDs对图像进行建模，这些图像位于由SPD跨越的黎曼流形上对称正定）矩阵，然后将Nystrom方法推广到SPD流形，并得到RKHS（复制核Hilbert空间）中CovD的近似。最后，我们通过这些近似值近似无限维CovDs。经验上，我们将我们的框架应用于图像集分类的任务。在三个基准数据集上获得的实验结果表明，我们提出的近似无限维CovD优于原始CovD。
