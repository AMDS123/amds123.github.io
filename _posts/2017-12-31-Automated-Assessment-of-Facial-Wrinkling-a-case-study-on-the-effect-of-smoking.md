##### Abstract
Facial wrinkle is one of the most prominent biological changes that accompanying the natural aging process. However, there are some external factors contributing to premature wrinkles development, such as sun exposure and smoking. Clinical studies have shown that heavy smoking causes premature wrinkles development. However, there is no computerised system that can automatically assess the facial wrinkles on the whole face. This study investigates the effect of smoking on facial wrinkling using a social habit face dataset and an automated computerised computer vision algorithm. The wrinkles pattern represented in the intensity of 0-255 was first extracted using a modified Hybrid Hessian Filter. The face was divided into ten predefined regions, where the wrinkles in each region was extracted. Then the statistical analysis was performed to analyse which region is effected mainly by smoking. The result showed that the density of wrinkles for smokers in two regions around the mouth was significantly higher than the non-smokers, at p-value of 0.05. Other regions are inconclusive due to lack of large scale dataset. Finally, the wrinkle was visually compared between smoker and non-smoker faces by generating a generic 3D face model.

面部皱纹是伴随着自然衰老过程的最显着的生物学变化之一。但是，有一些外部因素会导致过早的皱纹发展，例如日晒和吸烟。临床研究表明，严重的吸烟会导致过早的皱纹发展。但是，没有可以自动评估整个面部皱纹的计算机化系统。本研究使用社交习惯人脸数据集和自动计算机化的计算机视觉算法来调查吸烟对面部起皱的影响。首先使用改进的混合Hessian滤波器提取以0-255的强度表示的皱纹图案。脸被分成十个预定义的区域，每个区域的皱纹都被提取出来。然后进行统计分析，分析哪个区域主要受吸烟影响。结果显示，嘴周围两个地区吸烟者的皱纹密度显着高于非吸烟者，p值为0.05。其他地区由于缺乏大规模的数据集是不确定的。最后，通过生成通用3D脸部模型，在吸烟者和非吸烟者面部之间在视觉上比较皱纹。
