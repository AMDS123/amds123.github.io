##### Abstract
Programming question and answer (Q & A) websites, such as Quora, Stack Overflow, and Yahoo! Answer etc. helps us to understand the programming concepts easily and quickly in a way that has been tested and applied by many software developers. Stack Overflow is one of the most frequently used programming Q\&A website where the questions and answers posted are presently analyzed manually, which requires a huge amount of time and resource. To save the effort, we present a topic modeling based technique to analyze the words of the original texts to discover the themes that run through them. We also propose a method to automate the process of reviewing the quality of questions on Stack Overflow dataset in order to avoid ballooning the stack overflow with insignificant questions. The proposed method also recommends the appropriate tags for the new post, which averts the creation of unnecessary tags on Stack Overflow.

编程问答（Q＆A）网站，如Quora，Stack Overflow和Yahoo!答案等，有助于我们以一种经过许多软件开发人员测试和应用的方式，轻松快速地理解编程概念。堆栈溢出是最常用的编程问答网站之一，所发布的问题和答案目前是手动分析的，这需要大量的时间和资源。为了节省成本，我们提出了一种基于主题建模的技术来分析原文的文字，以发现贯穿它们的主题。我们还提出了一种自动化堆栈溢出数据集的问题质量检查过程的方法，以避免无关紧要的问题导致堆栈溢出。建议的方法还建议适当的标签为新的职位，这避免了堆栈溢出不必要的标签创建。
