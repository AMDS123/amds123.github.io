##### Abstract
For fine-grained visual classification, objects usually share similar geometric structure but present variant local appearance and different pose. Therefore, localizing and extracting discriminative local features play a crucial role in accurate category prediction. Existing works either pay attention to limited object parts or train isolated networks for locating and classification. In this paper, we propose Weakly Supervised Bilinear Attention Network (WS-BAN) to solve these issues. It jointly generates a set of attention maps (region-of-interest maps) to indicate the locations of object's parts and extracts sequential part features by Bilinear Attention Pooling (BAP). Besides, we propose attention regularization and attention dropout to weakly supervise the generating process of attention maps. WS-BAN can be trained end-to-end and achieves the state-of-the-art performance on multiple fine-grained classification datasets, including CUB-200-2011, Stanford Car and FGVC-Aircraft, which demonstrated its effectiveness.
