##### Abstract
Despite the recent developments that allowed neural networks to achieve impressive performance on a variety of applications, these models are intrinsically affected by the problem of overgeneralization, due to their partitioning of the full input space into the fixed set of target classes used during training. Thus it is possible for novel inputs belonging to categories unknown during training or even completely unrecognizable to humans to fool the system into classifying them as one of the known classes, even with a high degree of confidence. Solving this problem may help improve the security of such systems in critical applications, and may further lead to applications in the context of open set recognition and 1-class recognition. This paper presents a novel way to compute a confidence score using denoising autoencoders and shows that such confidence score can correctly identify the regions of the input space close to the training distribution by approximately identifying its local maxima.

尽管最近的发展允许神经网络在各种应用中实现令人印象深刻的性能，但是由于这些模型将全部输入空间划分为训练期间使用的固定目标类别集合，所以这些模型本质上受到过度概化问题的影响。因此，在训练期间属于未知类别的新颖输入或者甚至完全不可识别的人类愚弄系统将其分类为已知类别之一，即使具有高度置信度也是如此。解决这个问题可能有助于提高这些系统在关键应用中的安全性，并且可能进一步导致在开放集合识别和1级识别的情况下的应用。本文提出了一种使用去噪自动编码器计算置信度得分的新方法，并且表明这种置信度得分可以通过近似地识别其局部最大值来正确地识别接近训练分布的输入空间的区域。
