##### Abstract
Significant training is required to visually interpret neonatal EEG signals. This study explores alternative sound-based methods for EEG interpretation which are designed to allow for intuitive and quick differentiation between healthy background activity and abnormal activity such as seizures. A novel method based on frequency and amplitude modulation (FM/AM) is presented. The algorithm is tuned to facilitate the audio domain perception of rhythmic activity which is specific to neonatal seizures. The method is compared with the previously developed phase vocoder algorithm for different time compressing factors. A survey is conducted amongst a cohort of non-EEG experts to quantitatively and qualitatively examine the performance of sound-based methods in comparison with the visual interpretation. It is shown that both sonification methods perform similarly well, with a smaller inter-observer variability in comparison with visual. A post-survey analysis of results is performed by examining the sensitivity of the ear to frequency evolution in audio.

需要进行重要的培训来直观地解读新生儿脑电信号。这项研究探索了另外一种基于声音的脑电解释方法，旨在使健康的背景活动和异常活动（如癫痫发作）之间的直观和快速区分。提出了一种基于频率和幅度调制（FM / AM）的新方法。该算法被调整来促进对于新生儿癫痫发作特有的节律活动的音频领域感知。该方法与先前开发的用于不同时间压缩因子的相位声码器算法进行比较。在一组非EEG专家中进行了一项调查，以与视觉解释相比，定量和定性地检查基于声音的方法的表现。结果表明，两种超声方法表现相似，与视觉相比观察者间的变异性更小。对结果进行事后调查分析是通过检查音频中耳朵与频率演变的敏感性来进行的。
