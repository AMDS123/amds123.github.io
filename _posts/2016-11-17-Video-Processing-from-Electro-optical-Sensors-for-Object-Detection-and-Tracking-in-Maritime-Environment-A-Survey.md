##### Abstract
We present a survey on maritime object detection and tracking approaches, which are essential for the development of a navigational system for autonomous ships. The electro-optical (EO) sensor considered here is a video camera that operates in the visible or the infrared spectra, which conventionally complement radar and sonar and have demonstrated effectiveness for situational awareness at sea has demonstrated its effectiveness over the last few years. This paper provides a comprehensive overview of various approaches of video processing for object detection and tracking in the maritime environment. We follow an approach-based taxonomy wherein the advantages and limitations of each approach are compared. The object detection system consists of the following modules: horizon detection, static background subtraction and foreground segmentation. Each of these has been studied extensively in maritime situations and has been shown to be challenging due to the presence of background motion especially due to waves and wakes. The main processes involved in object tracking include video frame registration, dynamic background subtraction, and the object tracking algorithm itself. The challenges for robust tracking arise due to camera motion, dynamic background and low contrast of tracked object, possibly due to environmental degradation. The survey also discusses multisensor approaches and commercial maritime systems that use EO sensors. The survey also highlights methods from computer vision research which hold promise to perform well in maritime EO data processing. Performance of several maritime and computer vision techniques is evaluated on newly proposed Singapore Maritime Dataset.

我们提出了一个海上目标检测和跟踪方法的调查，这对于自主船舶的导航系统的发展是必不可少的。这里所考虑的光电（EO）传感器是一种摄像机，其工作在可见光或红外光谱，这通常补充雷达和声纳，并已证明在海上的态势感知的有效性已经证明其在过去几年的有效性。本文全面概述了在海上环境中进行物体检测和跟踪的各种视频处理方法。我们遵循基于方法的分类法，其中比较每种方法的优点和局限性。目标检测系统由以下模块组成：水平检测，静态背景减除和前景分割。其中每一项都已经在海事情况下进行了广泛的研究，并且由于背景运动的存在，特别是由于波浪和尾流，已经显示出其具有挑战性。目标跟踪涉及的主要过程包括视频帧注册，动态背景扣除和对象跟踪算法本身。由于摄像机运动，动态背景和跟踪对象的低对比度，可能由于环境恶化而出现鲁棒跟踪的挑战。该调查还讨论了使用EO传感器的多传感器方法和商业海事系统。该调查还突出了计算机视觉研究方法，这些方法有望在海上EO数据处理中表现良好。新近提出的新加坡海事数据集评估了几项海事和计算机视觉技术的性能。
