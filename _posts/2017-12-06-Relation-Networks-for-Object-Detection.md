##### Abstract
Although it is well believed for years that modeling relations between objects would help object recognition, there has not been evidence that the idea is working in the deep learning era. All state-of-the-art object detection systems still rely on recognizing object instances individually, without exploiting their relations during learning. This work proposes an object relation module. It processes a set of objects simultaneously through interaction between their appearance feature and geometry, thus allowing modeling of their relations. It is lightweight and in-place. It does not require additional supervision and is easy to embed in existing networks. It is shown effective on improving object recognition and duplicate removal steps in the modern object detection pipeline. It verifies the efficacy of modeling object relations in CNN based detection. It gives rise to the first fully end-to-end object detector.

尽管多年来人们相信，对象之间的建模关系有助于对象的识别，但是还没有证据表明这个想法在深度学习时代是有效的。所有最先进的对象检测系统仍然依赖于单独识别对象实例，而不需要在学习中利用它们之间的关系。这项工作提出了一个对象关系模块。它通过外观特征和几何图形之间的相互作用同时处理一组对象，从而允许建立它们之间的关系。它是轻量级的，就地。它不需要额外的监督，很容易嵌入现有的网络。在现代物体检测流水线中，它对于改善目标识别和重复清除步骤是有效的。它验证了建模对象关系在基于CNN的检测中的有效性。它产生了第一个完全端对端的物体探测器。
