##### Abstract
Deep neural networks have lately shown tremendous performance in various applications including vision and speech processing tasks. However, alongside their ability to perform these tasks with such high accuracy, it has been shown that they are highly susceptible to adversarial attacks: a small change in the input would cause the network to err with high confidence. This phenomenon exposes an inherent fault in these networks and their ability to generalize well. For this reason, providing robustness to adversarial attacks is an important challenge in networks training, which has led to extensive research. In this work, we suggest a theoretically inspired novel approach to improve the networks' robustness. Our method applies regularization using the Frobenius norm of the Jacobian of the network, which is applied as post-processing, after regular training has finished. We demonstrate empirically that it leads to enhanced robustness results with a minimal change in the original network's accuracy.

深度神经网络最近在各种应用中表现出巨大的性能，包括视觉和语音处理任务。然而，除了他们以如此高的准确度执行这些任务的能力之外，已经表明它们极易受到对抗性攻击：输入的微小变化将导致网络以高置信度出错。这种现象暴露了这些网络中的固有缺陷及其普遍推广的能力。出于这个原因，为对抗性攻击提供稳健性是网络培训中的一项重要挑战，这导致了广泛的研究。在这项工作中，我们提出了一种理论上启发的新方法来改善网络的稳健性。我们的方法采用网络雅可比行列式的Frobenius范数进行正则化，经过定期训练后，作为后处理应用。我们凭经验证明，它可以在原始网络精度最小化的情况下实现增强的稳健性结果。
