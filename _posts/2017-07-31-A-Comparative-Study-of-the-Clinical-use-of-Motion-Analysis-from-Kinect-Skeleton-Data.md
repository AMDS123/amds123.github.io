##### Abstract
The analysis of human motion as a clinical tool can bring many benefits such as the early detection of disease and the monitoring of recovery, so in turn helping people to lead independent lives. However, it is currently under used. Developments in depth cameras, such as Kinect, have opened up the use of motion analysis in settings such as GP surgeries, care homes and private homes. To provide an insight into the use of Kinect in the healthcare domain, we present a review of the current state of the art. We then propose a method that can represent human motions from time-series data of arbitrary length, as a single vector. Finally, we demonstrate the utility of this method by extracting a set of clinically significant features and using them to detect the age related changes in the motions of a set of 54 individuals, with a high degree of certainty (F1- score between 0.9 - 1.0). Indicating its potential application in the detection of a range of age-related motion impairments.

将人体运动作为临床工具的分析，可以带来很多好处，如疾病的早期发现和恢复的监测，从而帮助人们过上独立的生活。但是，它目前正在使用中。像Kinect这样的深度相机的发展已经开启了在诸如全科医生手术室，护理之家和私人住宅之类的设置中使用运动分析。为了深入了解Kinect在医疗保健领域的应用，我们介绍了当前最先进的技术。然后，我们提出一种方法，可以将任意长度的时间序列数据中的人体运动表示为一个单独的向量。最后，我们通过提取一组具有临床意义的特征来证明这种方法的实用性，并使用它们来检测一组54个个体的运动中与年龄相关的变化，具有高度的确定性（F1分数在0.9-1.0之间）。指出其在检测一系列与年龄有关的运动障碍方面的潜在应用。
