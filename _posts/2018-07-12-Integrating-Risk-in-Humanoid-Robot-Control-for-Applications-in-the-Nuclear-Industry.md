##### Abstract
This paper discuss the integration of risk into a robot control framework for decommissioning applications in the nuclear industry. Our overall objective is to allow the robot to evaluate a risk associated with several methods of completing the same task by combining a set of action sequences. If the environment is known and in the absence of sensing errors each set of actions would successfully complete the task. In this paper, instead of attempting to model the errors associated with each sensing system in order to compute an exact solution, a set of solutions are obtained along with a prescribed risk index. The risk associated with each set of actions can then be compared to possible payoffs or rewards, for instance task completion time or power consumption. This information is then sent to a high level decision planner, for instance a human teleoperator, who can then make a more informed decision regarding the robots actions. In order to illustrate the concept, we introduce three specific risk measures, namely, the collision risk and the risk of toppling and failure risk associated with grasping an object. We demonstrate the results from this foundational study of risk-aware compositional robot autonomy in simulation using NASA's Valkyrie humanoid robot, and the grasping simulator HAPTIX.

本文讨论了将风险整合到核工业退役应用的机器人控制框架中。我们的总体目标是允许机器人通过组合一组动作序列来评估与完成相同任务的几种方法相关的风险。如果环境是已知的并且在没有感测错误的情况下，则每组动作将成功完成任务。在本文中，不是试图模拟与每个传感系统相关的误差以便计算精确解，而是获得一组解决方案以及规定的风险指数。然后可以将与每组动作相关联的风险与可能的支付或奖励进行比较，例如任务完成时间或功耗。然后将该信息发送给高级决策计划器，例如人类远程操作员，然后可以对机器人动作做出更明智的决定。为了说明这个概念，我们引入了三个具体的风险度量，即碰撞风险和倾倒风险以及与抓取物体相关的失败风险。我们使用NASA的Valkyrie人形机器人和抓取模拟器HAPTIX，展示了基于风险感知的组合机器人自主性的基础研究结果。
