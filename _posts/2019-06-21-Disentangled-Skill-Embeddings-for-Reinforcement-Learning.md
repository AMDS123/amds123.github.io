##### Abstract
We propose a novel framework for multi-task reinforcement learning (MTRL). Using a variational inference formulation, we learn policies that generalize across both changing dynamics and goals. The resulting policies are parametrized by shared parameters that allow for transfer between different dynamics and goal conditions, and by task-specific latent-space embeddings that allow for specialization to particular tasks. We show how the latent-spaces enable generalization to unseen dynamics and goals conditions. Additionally, policies equipped with such embeddings serve as a space of skills (or options) for hierarchical reinforcement learning. Since we can change task dynamics and goals independently, we name our framework Disentangled Skill Embeddings (DSE).
