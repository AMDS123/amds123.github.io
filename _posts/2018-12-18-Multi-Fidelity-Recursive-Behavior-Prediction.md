##### Abstract
Predicting the behavior of surrounding vehicles is a critical problem in automated driving. We present a novel game theoretic behavior prediction model that achieves state of the art prediction accuracy by explicitly reasoning about possible future interaction between agents. We evaluate our approach on the NGSIM vehicle trajectory data set and demonstrate lower root mean square error than state-of-the-art methods.
