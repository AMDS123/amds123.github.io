##### Abstract
Generative models, in particular generative adverserial networks (GANs), have received a lot of attention recently. A number of GAN variants have been proposed and have been utilized in many applications. Despite large strides in terms of theoretical progress, evaluating and comparing GANs remains a daunting task. While several measures have been introduced, as of yet, there is no consensus as to which measure best captures strengths and limitations of models and should be used for fair model comparison. As in other areas of computer vision and machine learning, it is critical to settle on one or few good measures to steer the progress in this field. In this paper, I review and critically discuss more than 19 quantitative and 4 qualitative measures for evaluating generative models with a particular emphasis on GAN-derived models.

生成模型，特别是生成副本网络（GAN）最近受到了很多关注。已经提出了许多GAN变体并且已经在许多应用中使用。尽管在理论上取得了长足的进步，但评估和比较GAN依然是一项艰巨的任务。虽然已经采取了几项措施，但至今尚未就哪种措施最能体现模型的优点和局限性达成共识，并应将其用于公平模型比较。和其他计算机视觉和机器学习领域一样，解决一个或几个很好的措施来引导这个领域的进展是至关重要的。在本文中，我回顾并批判性地讨论了超过19种定量和4种定性评估生成模型的方法，特别强调了GAN衍生模型。
