##### Abstract
Despite the recent successes in robotics, artificial intelligence and computer vision, a complete artificial agent necessarily must include active perception. A multitude of ideas and methods for how to accomplish this have already appeared in the past, their broader utility perhaps impeded by insufficient computational power or costly hardware. The history of these ideas, perhaps selective due to our perspectives, is presented with the goal of organizing the past literature and highlighting the seminal contributions. We argue that those contributions are as relevant today as they were decades ago and, with the state of modern computational tools, are poised to find new life in the robotic perception systems of the next decade.

尽管最近在机器人，人工智能和计算机视觉方面取得了成功，但一个完整的人造代理必须包含积极的认知。过去已经出现了许多关于如何实现这一点的想法和方法，但由于计算能力不足或硬件昂贵，其更广泛的用途可能会受到阻碍。由于我们的观点，这些观点的历史可能是有选择的，其目的是组织过去的文献和突出的开创性贡献。我们认为，这些贡献今天与数十年前一样相关，而且随着现代计算工具的发展，它们正准备在未来十年的机器人感知系统中找到新的生命。
