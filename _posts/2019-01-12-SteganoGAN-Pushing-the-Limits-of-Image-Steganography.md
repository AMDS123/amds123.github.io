##### Abstract
Image steganography is a procedure for hiding messages inside pictures. While other techniques such as cryptography aim to prevent adversaries from reading the secret message, steganography aims to hide the presence of the message itself. In this paper, we propose a novel technique based on generative adversarial networks for hiding arbitrary binary data in images. We show that our approach achieves state-of-the-art payloads of 4.4 bits per pixel, evades detection by steganalysis tools, and is effective on images from multiple datasets. To enable fair comparisons, we have released an open source library that is available online at https://github.com/DAI-Lab/SteganoGAN.
