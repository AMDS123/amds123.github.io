##### Abstract
Matlab version 7.1 had been used to detect playing cards on a Casino table and the suits and ranks of these cards had been identified. The process gives an example of an application of computer vision to a problem where rectangular objects are to be detected and the information content of the objects are extracted out. In the case of playing cards, it is the suit and rank of each card. The image processing system is done in two passes. Pass 1 detects rectangular shapes and template matched with a template of the left and right edges of the cards. Pass 2 extracts the suit and rank of the cards by matching the top left portion of the card that contains both rank and suit information, with stored templates of ranks and suits of the playing cards using a series of if-then statements.

Matlab版本7.1已经被用来检测赌场桌上的扑克牌，并且已经识别出这些扑克牌的套装和等级。该过程给出了将计算机视觉应用于要检测矩形对象并且提取对象的信息内容的问题的示例。在扑克牌的情况下，是每张牌的套装和等级。图像处理系统分两次完成。通过1检测矩形形状和与卡片的左右边缘的模板匹配的模板。通行证2通过使用包含等级和套装信息的牌的左上部分与使用一系列if-then语句的扑克牌的等级和套装的存储模板匹配来提取套牌和等级。
