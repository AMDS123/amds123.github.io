##### Abstract
Text line detection and localization is a crucial step for full page document analysis, but still suffers from heterogeneity of real life documents. In this paper, we present a new approach for full page text recognition. Localization of the text lines is based on regressions with Fully Convolutional Neural Networks and Multidimensional Long Short-Term Memory as contextual layers. In order to increase the efficiency of this localization method, only the position of the left side of the text lines are predicted. The text recognizer is then in charge of predicting the end of the text to recognize. This method has shown good results for full page text recognition on the highly heterogeneous Maurdor dataset.

文本行检测和本地化是整页文档分析的关键步骤，但仍然受到现实生活文档的异质性影响。在本文中，我们提出了一个全页面文本识别的新方法。文本行的本地化基于完全卷积神经网络和多维长期短期记忆作为上下文层的回归。为了提高这种定位方法的效率，只预测文本行左侧的位置。文本识别器然后负责预测要识别的文本的结尾。该方法在高度异构的Maurdor数据集上对整页文本识别显示出良好的结果。
