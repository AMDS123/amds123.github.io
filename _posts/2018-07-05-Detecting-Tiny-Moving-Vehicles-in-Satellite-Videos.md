##### Abstract
In recent years, the satellite videos have been captured by a moving satellite platform. In contrast to consumer, movie, and common surveillance videos, satellite video can record the snapshot of the city-scale scene. In a broad field-of-view of satellite videos, each moving target would be very tiny and usually composed of several pixels in frames. Even worse, the noise signals also existed in the video frames, since the background of the video frame has the subpixel-level and uneven moving thanks to the motion of satellites. We argue that this is a new type of computer vision task since previous technologies are unable to detect such tiny vehicles efficiently. This paper proposes a novel framework that can identify the small moving vehicles in satellite videos. In particular, we offer a novel detecting algorithm based on the local noise modeling. We differentiate the potential vehicle targets from noise patterns by an exponential probability distribution. Subsequently, a multi-morphological-cue based discrimination strategy is designed to distinguish correct vehicle targets from a few existing noises further. Another significant contribution is to introduce a series of evaluation protocols to measure the performance of tiny moving vehicle detection systematically. We annotate a satellite video manually and use it to test our algorithms under different evaluation criterion. The proposed algorithm is also compared with the state-of-the-art baselines, and demonstrates the advantages of our framework over the benchmarks.

近年来，卫星视频已被移动的卫星平台捕获。与消费者，电影和普通监控视频相比，卫星视频可以记录城市规模场景的快照。在卫星视频的广阔视野中，每个移动目标将非常小并且通常由帧中的几个像素组成。更糟糕的是，由于卫星的运动，视频帧的背景具有亚像素级并且不均匀移动，因此视频帧中也存在噪声信号。我们认为这是一种新型的计算机视觉任务，因为以前的技术无法有效地检测到这种小型车辆。本文提出了一种新的框架，可以识别卫星视频中的小型移动车辆。特别是，我们提供了一种基于局部噪声建模的新型检测算法。我们通过指数概率分布将潜在的车辆目标与噪声模式区分开来。随后，基于多形态线索的辨别策略被设计用于进一步区分正确的车辆目标与少量现有噪声。另一个重要的贡献是引入一系列评估协议来系统地测量微小移动车辆检测的性能。我们手动注释卫星视频，并使用它在不同的评估标准下测试我们的算法。该算法还与最先进的基线进行了比较，并展示了我们的框架优于基准的优势。
