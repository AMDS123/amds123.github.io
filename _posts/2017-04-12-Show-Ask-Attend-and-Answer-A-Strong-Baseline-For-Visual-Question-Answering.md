##### Abstract
This paper presents a new baseline for visual question answering task. Given an image and a question in natural language, our model produces accurate answers according to the content of the image. Our model, while being architecturally simple and relatively small in terms of trainable parameters, sets a new state of the art on both unbalanced and balanced VQA benchmark. On VQA 1.0 open ended challenge, our model achieves 64.6% accuracy on the test-standard set without using additional data, an improvement of 0.4% over state of the art, and on newly released VQA 2.0, our model scores 59.7% on validation set outperforming best previously reported results by 0.5%. The results presented in this paper are especially interesting because very similar models have been tried before but significantly lower performance were reported. In light of the new results we hope to see more meaningful research on visual question answering in the future.

本文提出了视觉问答任务的新基线。给定图像和自然语言的问题，我们的模型根据图像的内容产生准确的答案。我们的模型虽然在结构上简单且在可训练参数方面相对较小，但在不平衡和平衡的VQA基准测试中树立了新的技术水平。在VQA 1.0开放式挑战中，我们的模型在不使用额外数据的情况下在测试标准集上达到64.6％的准确度，比现有技术提高0.4％，在新发布的VQA 2.0上，我们的模型在验证集上得分为59.7％优于先前报告的最佳结果0.5％。本文提供的结果特别有趣，因为之前已经尝试过非常相似的模型，但报告的性能显着降低。鉴于新的结果，我们希望在未来看到更有意义的视觉问答研究。
