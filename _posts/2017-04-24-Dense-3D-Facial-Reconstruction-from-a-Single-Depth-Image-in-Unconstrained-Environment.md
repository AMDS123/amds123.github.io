##### Abstract
With the increasing demands of applications in virtual reality such as 3D films, virtual Human-Machine Interactions and virtual agents, the analysis of 3D human face analysis is considered to be more and more important as a fundamental step for those virtual reality tasks. Due to information provided by an additional dimension, 3D facial reconstruction enables aforementioned tasks to be achieved with higher accuracy than those based on 2D facial analysis. The denser the 3D facial model is, the more information it could provide. However, most existing dense 3D facial reconstruction methods require complicated processing and high system cost. To this end, this paper presents a novel method that simplifies the process of dense 3D facial reconstruction by employing only one frame of depth data obtained with an off-the-shelf RGB-D sensor. The experiments showed competitive results with real world data.

随着虚拟现实应用对3D电影，虚拟人机交互和虚拟代理的需求不断增加，3D人脸分析被认为越来越重要，作为这些虚拟现实任务的基本步骤。由于附加维度提供的信息，三维面部重建使得能够以比基于二维面部分析的那些更高的准确度实现上述任务。 3D面部模型越密集，它可以提供的信息就越多。然而，大多数现有的高密度3D面部重建方法需要复杂的处理和高系统成本。为此，本文提出了一种新颖的方法，该方法通过仅使用一个由现成的RGB-D传感器获得的深度数据的一帧来简化高密度三维面部重建的过程。实验显示与现实世界的数据竞争的结果。
