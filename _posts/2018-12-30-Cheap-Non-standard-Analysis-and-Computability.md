##### Abstract
Non standard analysis is an area of Mathematics dealing with notions of infinitesimal and infinitely large numbers, in which many statements from classical analysis can be expressed very naturally. Cheap non-standard analysis introduced by Terence Tao in 2012 is based on the idea that considering that a property holds eventually is sufficient to give the essence of many of its statements. This provides constructivity but at some (acceptable) price. We consider computability in cheap non-standard analysis. We prove that many concepts from computable analysis as well as several concepts from computability can be very elegantly and alternatively presented in this framework. It provides a dual view and dual proofs to several statements already known in these fields.
