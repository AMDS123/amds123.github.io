##### Abstract
Thermal cameras shows noisy images due to their limited thermal resolution, especially for scenes of low temperature difference. In this paper, to deal with noise problem, we propose a novel neural network architecture with repeatable denoising inception residual blocks(DnIRB) for noise learning. Each DnIRB has two sub-blocks with difference receptive fields and one shortcut connection for preventing vanishing gradient problem. The proposed approach is tested for thermal images. The experimental results show that the proposed approach show the best SQNR performance and reasonable processing time compared with state-of-the-art denoising methods.
