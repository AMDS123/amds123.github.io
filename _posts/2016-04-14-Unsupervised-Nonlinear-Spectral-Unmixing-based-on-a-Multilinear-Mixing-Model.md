##### Abstract
In the community of remote sensing, nonlinear mixing models have recently received particular attention in hyperspectral image processing. In this paper, we present a novel nonlinear spectral unmixing method following the recent multilinear mixing model of [1], which includes an infinite number of terms related to interactions between different endmembers. The proposed unmixing method is unsupervised in the sense that the endmembers are estimated jointly with the abundances and other parameters of interest, i.e., the transition probability of undergoing further interactions. Non-negativity and sum-to one constraints are imposed on abundances while only nonnegativity is considered for endmembers. The resulting unmixing problem is formulated as a constrained nonlinear optimization problem, which is solved by a block coordinate descent strategy, consisting of updating the endmembers, abundances and transition probability iteratively. The proposed method is evaluated and compared with linear unmixing methods for synthetic and real hyperspectral datasets acquired by the AVIRIS sensor. The advantage of using non-linear unmixing as opposed to linear unmixing is clearly shown in these examples.

在遥感领域，非线性混合模型最近在高光谱图像处理中受到了特别的关注。在本文中，我们提出了一种新的非线性光谱分离方法，遵循最近的多线性混合模型[1]，其中包括与不同端元之间的相互作用有关的无数个项。所提出的解混方法是无监督的，因为端元是与丰度和其它感兴趣的参数（即进行进一步交互的转换概率）联合估计的。非消极性和总和的限制是强加给丰度，而只有非负性被认为是为了成员。由此产生的非混合问题被描述为一个约束非线性优化问题，由块坐标下降策略解决，包括迭代地更新端元，丰度和转移概率。所提出的方法进行评估，并与AVIRIS传感器获取的合成和真实高光谱数据集的线性解混合方法进行比较。在这些例子中清楚地显示了与线性解混相反的使用非线性解混的优点。
