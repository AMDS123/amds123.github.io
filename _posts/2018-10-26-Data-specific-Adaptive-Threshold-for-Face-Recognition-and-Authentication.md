##### Abstract
Many face recognition systems boost the performance using deep learning models, but only a few researches go into the mechanisms for dealing with online registration. Although we can obtain discriminative facial features through the state-of-the-art deep model training, how to decide the best threshold for practical use remains a challenge. We develop a technique of adaptive threshold mechanism to improve the recognition accuracy. We also design a face recognition system along with the registering procedure to handle online registration. Furthermore, we introduce a new evaluation protocol to better evaluate the performance of an algorithm for real-world scenarios. Under our proposed protocol, our method can achieve a 22\% accuracy improvement on the LFW dataset.
