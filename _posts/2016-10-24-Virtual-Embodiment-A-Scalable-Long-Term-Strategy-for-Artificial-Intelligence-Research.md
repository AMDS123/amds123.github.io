##### Abstract
Meaning has been called the "holy grail" of a variety of scientific disciplines, ranging from linguistics to philosophy, psychology and the neurosciences. The field of Artifical Intelligence (AI) is very much a part of that list: the development of sophisticated natural language semantics is a sine qua non for achieving a level of intelligence comparable to humans. Embodiment theories in cognitive science hold that human semantic representation depends on sensori-motor experience; the abundant evidence that human meaning representation is grounded in the perception of physical reality leads to the conclusion that meaning must depend on a fusion of multiple (perceptual) modalities. Despite this, AI research in general, and its subdisciplines such as computational linguistics and computer vision in particular, have focused primarily on tasks that involve a single modality. Here, we propose virtual embodiment as an alternative, long-term strategy for AI research that is multi-modal in nature and that allows for the kind of scalability required to develop the field coherently and incrementally, in an ethically responsible fashion.

意义被称为各种科学学科的“圣杯”，从语言学到哲学，心理学和神经科学。人工智能（AI）领域非常重要：开发复杂的自然语言语义是实现与人类相媲美的智能水平的必要条件。认知科学的理论认为，人类的语义表征取决于感觉运动的经验;充分的证据表明，人的意义表征是基于对物理现实的认知，导致的结论是意义必须依赖于多种（感知）方式的融合。尽管如此，一般来说人工智能研究，尤其是计算语言学和计算机视觉等子学科，主要集中在涉及单一形式的任务上。在这里，我们提出虚拟实施方案作为人工智能研究的替代性长期战略，其本质上是多模态的，并且允许以道德上负责的方式连贯和递增地开发该领域所需的可扩展性。
