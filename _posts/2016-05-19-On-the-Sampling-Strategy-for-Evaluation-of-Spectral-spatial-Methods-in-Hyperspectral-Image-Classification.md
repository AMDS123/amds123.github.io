##### Abstract
Spectral-spatial processing has been increasingly explored in remote sensing hyperspectral image classification. While extensive studies have focused on developing methods to improve the classification accuracy, experimental setting and design for method evaluation have drawn little attention. In the scope of supervised classification, we find that traditional experimental designs for spectral processing are often improperly used in the spectral-spatial processing context, leading to unfair or biased performance evaluation. This is especially the case when training and testing samples are randomly drawn from the same image - a practice that has been commonly adopted in the experiments. Under such setting, the dependence caused by overlap between the training and testing samples may be artificially enhanced by some spatial information processing methods such as spatial filtering and morphological operation. Such interaction between training and testing sets has violated data independence assumption that is abided by supervised learning theory and performance evaluation mechanism. Therefore, the widely adopted pixel-based random sampling strategy is not always suitable to evaluate spectral-spatial classification algorithms because it is difficult to determine whether the improvement of classification accuracy is caused by incorporating spatial information into classifier or by increasing the overlap between training and testing samples. To partially solve this problem, we propose a novel controlled random sampling strategy for spectral-spatial methods. It can greatly reduce the overlap between training and testing samples and provides more objective and accurate evaluation.

光谱空间处理在遥感高光谱图像分类中已经得到越来越多的研究。虽然大量的研究集中在开发提高分类精度的方法上，但是对于方法评价的实验设置和设计却没有引起重视。在监督分类的范围内，我们发现传统的光谱处理实验设计往往不适用于光谱空间处理环境，导致不公平或有偏见的性能评估。当从同一图像中随机抽取样本进行训练和测试时尤其如此 - 这是实验中普遍采用的做法。在这样的背景下，空间滤波和形态学运算等空间信息处理方法可能会人为地增强训练样本和测试样本之间重叠的依赖性。训练集和测试集之间的这种交互违反了受监督学​​习理论和绩效评估机制遵守的数据独立性假设。因此，广泛采用的基于像素的随机采样策略并不总是适用于光谱空间分类算法的评估，因为难以确定分类精度的提高是由于将空间信息纳入分类器引起的，还是通过增加训练与分类之间的重叠测试样品。为了部分解决这个问题，我们提出了一种新的光谱空间控制随机采样策略。它可以大大减少培训和测试样本之间的重叠，并提供更客观和准确的评估。
