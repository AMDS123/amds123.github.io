##### Abstract
Speech recognition is a sequence prediction problem. Besides employing various deep learning approaches for framelevel classification, sequence-level discriminative training has been proved to be indispensable to achieve the state-of-the-art performance in large vocabulary continuous speech recognition (LVCSR). However, keyword spotting (KWS), as one of the most common speech recognition tasks, almost only benefits from frame-level deep learning due to the difficulty of getting competing sequence hypotheses. The few studies on sequence discriminative training for KWS are limited for fixed vocabulary or LVCSR based methods and have not been compared to the state-of-the-art deep learning based KWS approaches. In this paper, a sequence discriminative training framework is proposed for both fixed vocabulary and unrestricted acoustic KWS. Sequence discriminative training for both sequence-level generative and discriminative models are systematically investigated. By introducing word-independent phone lattices or non-keyword blank symbols to construct competing hypotheses, feasible and efficient sequence discriminative training approaches are proposed for acoustic KWS. Experiments showed that the proposed approaches obtained consistent and significant improvement in both fixed vocabulary and unrestricted KWS tasks, compared to previous frame-level deep learning based acoustic KWS methods.

语音识别是序列预测问题。除了采用各种深度学习方法进行帧级分类之外，序列级判别训练已被证明是实现大词汇量连续语音识别（LVCSR）中最先进性能所不可或缺的。然而，关键字定位（KWS）作为最常见的语音识别任务之一，几乎仅受益于帧级深度学习，因为难以获得竞争序列假设。关于KWS的序列判别训练的少数研究仅限于固定词汇或基于LVCSR的方法，并且尚未与基于最新深度学习的KWS方法进行比较。在本文中，针对固定词汇和非限制声学KWS提出了序列判别训练框架。系统地研究了序列级生成和判别模型的序列判别训练。通过引入与字无关的电话格子或非关键字空白符号来构建竞争假设，为声学KWS提出了可行且有效的序列判别训练方法。实验表明，与先前基于帧级深度学习的声学KWS方法相比，所提出的方法在固定词汇和无限制KWS任务中获得了一致且显着的改进。
