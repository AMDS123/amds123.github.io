##### Abstract
Prior knowledge has been shown very useful to address many natural language processing tasks. Many approaches have been proposed to formalise a variety of knowledge, however, whether the proposed approach is robust or sensitive to the knowledge supplied to the model has rarely been discussed. In this paper, we propose three regularization terms on top of generalized expectation criteria, and conduct extensive experiments to justify the robustness of the proposed methods. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed methods obtain remarkable improvements and are much more robust than baselines.

##### Abstract (translated by Google)
已有的知识已被证明对解决许多自然语言处理任务非常有用。已经提出了许多方法来形式化各种知识，然而，所提出的方法对提供给模型的知识是强健的还是敏感的，很少被讨论。本文在广义期望准则的基础上提出了三个正则化项，并进行了广泛的实验验证了所提出方法的稳健性。实验结果表明，我们提出的方法获得了显着的改进，比基线更强大。
