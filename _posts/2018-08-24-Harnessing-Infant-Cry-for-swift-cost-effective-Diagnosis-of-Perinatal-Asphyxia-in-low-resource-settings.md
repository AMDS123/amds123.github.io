##### Abstract
Perinatal Asphyxia is one of the top three causes of infant mortality in developing countries, resulting to the death of about 1.2 million newborns every year. At its early stages, the presence of asphyxia cannot be conclusively determined visually or via physical examination, but by medical diagnosis. In resource-poor settings, where skilled attendance at birth is a luxury, most cases only get detected when the damaging consequences begin to manifest or worse still, after death of the affected infant. In this project, we explored the approach of machine learning in developing a low-cost diagnostic solution. We designed a support vector machine-based pattern recognition system that models patterns in the cries of known asphyxiating infants (and normal infants) and then uses the developed model for classification of `new' infants as having asphyxia or not. Our prototype has been tested in a laboratory setting to give prediction accuracy of up to 88.85%. If higher accuracies can be obtained, this research may be a key contributor to the 4th Millennium Development Goal (MDG) of reducing mortality in under-five children.

围产期窒息是发展中国家婴儿死亡的三大原因之一，导致每年约120万新生儿死亡。在早期阶段，窒息的存在不能通过视觉或体格检查确定，而是通过医学诊断确定。在资源匮乏的环境中，出生时熟练的出勤是一种奢侈，大多数病例只有在受影响的婴儿死亡后，破坏性后果开始显现或更糟的情况下才能被发现。在这个项目中，我们探索了机器学习在开发低成本诊断解决方案中的方法。我们设计了一个基于支持向量机的模式识别系统，模拟已知的窒息婴儿（和正常婴儿）的哭泣模式，然后使用开发的模型将“新”婴儿分类为窒息与否。我们的原型已在实验室环境中进行测试，预测准确度高达88.85％。如果能够获得更高的准确度，这项研究可能是第四个千年发展目标（MDG）降低五岁以下儿童死亡率的关键因素。
