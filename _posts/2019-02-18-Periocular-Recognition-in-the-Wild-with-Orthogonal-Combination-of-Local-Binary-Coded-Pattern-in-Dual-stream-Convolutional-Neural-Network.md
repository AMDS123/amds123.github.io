##### Abstract
In spite of the advancements made in the periocular recognition, the dataset and periocular recognition in the wild remains a challenge. In this paper, we propose a multilayer fusion approach by means of a pair of shared parameters (dual-stream) convolutional neural network where each network accepts RGB data and a novel colour-based texture descriptor, namely Orthogonal Combination-Local Binary Coded Pattern (OC-LBCP) for periocular recognition in the wild. Specifically, two distinct late-fusion layers are introduced in the dual-stream network to aggregate the RGB data and OC-LBCP. Thus, the network beneficial from this new feature of the late-fusion layers for accuracy performance gain. We also introduce and share a new dataset for periocular in the wild, namely Ethnic-ocular dataset for benchmarking. The proposed network has also been assessed on two publicly available datasets, namely CASIA-iris distance and UBIPr. The proposed network outperforms several competing approaches on these datasets.
