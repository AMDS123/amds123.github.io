##### Abstract
Style transfer is a field with growing interest and use cases in deep learning. Recent work has shown Generative Adversarial Networks(GANs) can be used to create realistic images of virtually stained slide images in digital pathology with clinically validated interpretability. Digital pathology images are typically of extremely high resolution, making tilewise analysis necessary for deep learning applications. It has been shown that image generators with instance normalization can cause a tiling artifact when a large image is reconstructed from the tilewise analysis. We introduce a novel perceptual embedding consistency loss significantly reducing the tiling artifact created in the reconstructed whole slide image (WSI). We validate our results by comparing virtually stained slide images with consecutive real stained tissue slide images. We also demonstrate that our model is more robust to contrast, color and brightness perturbations by running comparative sensitivity analysis tests.
