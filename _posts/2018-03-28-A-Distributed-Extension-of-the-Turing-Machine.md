##### Abstract
The Turing Machine has two implicit properties that depend on its underlying notion of computing: the format is fully determinate and computations are information preserving. Distributed representations lack these properties and cannot be fully captured by Turing's standard model. To address this limitation a distributed extension of the Turing Machine is introduced in this paper. In the extended machine, functions and abstractions are expressed extensionally and computations are entropic. The machine is applied to the definition of an associative memory, with its corresponding memory register, recognition and retrieval operations. The memory is tested with an experiment for storing and recognizing hand written digits with satisfactory results. The experiment can be seen as a proof of concept that information can be stored and processed effectively in a highly distributed fashion using a symbolic but not fully determinate format. The new machine augments the symbolic mode of computing with consequences on the way Church Thesis is understood. The paper is concluded with a discussion of some implications of the extended machine for Artificial Intelligence and Cognition.

##### Abstract (translated by Google)
图灵机具有两个隐含的属性，这取决于其基本的计算概念：格式完全确定，计算是信息保存。分布式表示缺少这些属性，并且不能完全被图灵的标准模型捕获。为了解决这个限制，本文介绍了图灵机的分布式扩展。在扩展机器中，函数和抽象是扩展表达的，而计算是熵的。该机器应用于关联存储器的定义，以及相应的存储器寄存器，识别和检索操作。内存通过实验来存储和识别手写数字并获得令人满意的结果。这个实验可以看作是一个概念证明，即信息可以使用符号但不是完全确定的格式以高度分布的方式有效地存储和处理。新机器增加了计算的象征性模式，并对教会论文的理解有所影响。本文最后讨论了扩展机器人工智能和认知的一些含义。
