##### Abstract
Lidar is extensively used in the industry and mass-market. Due to its measurement accuracy and insensitivity to illumination compared to cameras, It is applied onto a broad range of applications, like geodetic engineering, self driving cars or virtual reality. But the 3D Lidar with multi-beam is very expensive, and the massive measurements data can not be fully leveraged on some constrained platforms. The purpose of this paper is to explore the possibility of using cheap 2D Lidar off-the-shelf, to preform complex 3D Reconstruction, moreover, the generated 3D map quality is evaluated by our proposed metrics at the end. The 3D map is constructed in two ways, one way in which the scan is performed at known positions with an external rotary axis at another plane. The other way, in which the 2D Lidar for mapping and another 2D Lidar for localization are placed on a trolley, the trolley is pushed on the ground arbitrarily. The generated maps by different approaches are converted to octomaps uniformly before the evaluation. The similarity and difference between two maps will be evaluated by the proposed metrics thoroughly. The whole mapping system is composed of several modular components. A 3D bracket was made for assembling of the Lidar with a long range, the driver and the motor together. A cover platform made for the IMU and 2D Lidar with a shorter range but high accuracy. The software is stacked up in different ROS packages.

激光雷达广泛应用于工业和大众市场。与相机相比，由于其测量精度和对照明的不敏感性，它适用于广泛的应用，如大地测量工程，自动驾驶汽车或虚拟现实。但是具有多光束的3D激光雷达非常昂贵，并且在一些受限平台上无法充分利用海量测量数据。本文的目的是探索使用现成的廉价2D Lidar进行复杂3D重建的可能性，此外，生成的3D地图质量最终由我们提出的度量标准进行评估。 3D地图以两种方式构造，一种方式是在已知位置执行扫描，在另一平面处具有外部旋转轴。另一种方式是，用于绘图的2D激光雷达和用于定位的另一个2D激光雷达放置在手推车上，手推车被任意地推到地面上。在评估之前，通过不同方法生成的地图被均匀地转换为octomaps。两个地图之间的相似性和差异将通过提议的指标进行彻底评估。整个映射系统由几个模块化组件组成。制作了一个3D支架，用于将激光雷达与远距离，驱动器和电机组装在一起。为IMU和2D激光雷达制作的封面平台，射程更短但精度更高。该软件堆叠在不同的ROS包中。
