##### Abstract
Food fraud has been an area of great concern due to its risk to public health, reduction of food quality or nutritional value and for its economic consequences. For this reason, it's been object of regulation in many countries (e.g. [1], [2]). One type of food that has been frequently object of fraud through the addition of water or an aqueous solution is bovine meat. The traditional methods used to detect this kind of fraud are expensive, time-consuming and depend on physicochemical analysis that require complex laboratory techniques, specific for each added substance. In this paper, based on digital images of histological cuts of adulterated and not-adulterated (normal) bovine meat, we evaluate the of digital image analysis methods to identify the aforementioned kind of fraud, with focus on the Local Binary Pattern (LBP) algorithm.

由于食品欺诈危害公众健康，降低食品质量或营养价值及其经济后果，因此食品欺诈一直备受关注。因此，许多国家（如[1]，[2]）一直是监管的对象。经常通过添加水或水溶液来欺骗的一类食物是牛肉。用于检测这种欺诈的传统方法是昂贵的，耗时的并且取决于需要复杂的实验室技术的物理化学分析，对于每种添加的物质都是特定的。在本文中，基于掺假和非掺假（正常）牛肉的组织学切片的数字图像，我们评估了数字图像分析方法来识别上述类型的欺诈行为，重点是局部二值模式（LBP）算法。
