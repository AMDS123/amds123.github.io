##### Abstract
Recently, several discriminative learning approaches have been proposed for effective image restoration, achieving convincing trade-off between image quality and computational efficiency. However, these methods require separate training for each restoration task (e.g., denoising, deblurring, demosaicing) and problem condition (e.g., noise level of input images). This makes it time-consuming and difficult to encompass all tasks and conditions during training. In this paper, we propose a discriminative transfer learning method that incorporates formal proximal optimization and discriminative learning for general image restoration. The method requires a single-pass training and allows for reuse across various problems and conditions while achieving an efficiency comparable to previous discriminative approaches. Furthermore, after being trained, our model can be easily transferred to new likelihood terms to solve untrained tasks, or be combined with existing priors to further improve image restoration quality.

近来，已经提出了几种有区别的学习方法用于有效的图像恢复，在图像质量和计算效率之间取得令人信服的折衷。然而，这些方法需要针对每个恢复任务（例如去噪，去模糊，去马赛克）和问题条件（例如，输入图像的噪声水平）进行单独的训练。这使得在培训期间耗费所有的任务和条件是非常困难的。在本文中，我们提出了一种区分性转移学习方法，包括形式化的近端优化和一般图像恢复的判别式学习。该方法需要单程训练并允许在各种问题和条件下重复使用，同时实现与先前的区别性方法相当的效率。此外，经过训练后，我们的模型可以很容易地转移到新的似然项来解决未经训练的任务，或与现有的先验相结合，以进一步提高图像恢复质量。
