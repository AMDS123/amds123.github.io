##### Abstract
While deep neural networks have succeeded in several visual applications, such as object recognition, detection, and localization, by reaching very high classification accuracies, it is important to note that many real-world applications demand vary- ing costs for different types of misclassification errors, thus requiring cost-sensitive classification algorithms. Current models of deep neural networks for cost-sensitive classification are restricted to some specific network structures and limited depth. In this paper, we propose a novel framework that can be applied to deep neural networks with any structure to facilitate their learning of meaningful representations for cost-sensitive classification problems. Furthermore, the framework allows end- to-end training of deeper networks directly. The framework is designed by augmenting auxiliary neurons to the output of each hidden layer for layer-wise cost estimation, and including the total estimation loss within the optimization objective. Experimental results on public benchmark visual data sets with two cost information settings demonstrate that the proposed frame- work outperforms state-of-the-art cost-sensitive deep learning models.

虽然深度神经网络在诸如物体识别，检测和定位等几个视觉应用中取得了成功，但是要达到非常高的分类精度，重要的是要注意许多现实世界的应用要求不同类型的错误分类错误，因此需要成本敏感的分类算法。目前用于成本敏感分类的深度神经网络模型仅限于一些特定的网络结构和有限的深度。在本文中，我们提出了一个新的框架，可以应用于任何结构的深度神经网络，以方便他们学习有意义的表示成本敏感的分类问题。此外，该框架还允许直接对更深层网络进行端到端的培训。该框架的设计是通过将辅助神经元扩展到每个隐含层的输出来进行分层成本估计，并将最终估计损失包括在优化目标中。基于两个成本信息设置的公共基准视觉数据集的实验结果表明，所提出的框架优于最先进的成本敏感的深度学习模型。
