##### Abstract
In computed tomography (CT), metal implants increase the inconsistencies between the measured data and the linear attenuation assumption made by analytic CT reconstruction algorithms. The inconsistencies give rise to dark and bright bands and streaks in the reconstructed image, collectively called metal artifacts. These artifacts make it difficult for radiologists to render correct diagnostic decisions. We describe a data-driven metal artifact reduction (MAR) algorithm for image-guided spine surgery that applies to scenarios in which a prior CT scan of the patient is available. We tested the proposed method with two clinical datasets that were both obtained during spine surgery. Using the proposed method, we were not only able to remove the dark and bright streaks caused by the implanted screws but we also recovered the anatomical structures hidden by these artifacts. This results in an improved capability of surgeons to confirm the correctness of the implanted pedicle screw placements.

在计算机断层扫描（CT）中，金属植入物增加了测量数据与分析CT重建算法所做的线性衰减假设之间的不一致性。不一致性在重建图像中产生暗和亮带和条纹，统称为金属伪影。这些伪影使放射科医师难以做出正确的诊断决策。我们描述了一种用于图像引导脊柱手术的数据驱动金属伪影减少（MAR）算法，该算法适用于患者的先前CT扫描可用的情况。我们使用两个临床数据集测试了所提出的方法，这两个临床数据集都是在脊柱手使用所提出的方法，我们不仅能够去除由植入的螺钉引起的暗和亮条纹，而且我们还恢复了由这些伪影隐藏的解剖结构。这导致外科医生能够确认植入的椎弓根螺钉放置的正确性。
