##### Abstract
Since the landmarks established by the Cremonese school in the 16th century, the history of violin design has been marked by experimentation. While great effort has been invested since the early 19th century by the scientific community on researching violin acoustics, substantially less attention has been given to the statistical characterization of how the violin shape evolved over time. In this paper we study the morphology of violins retrieved from the Musical Instrument Museums Online (MIMO) database -- the largest freely accessible platform providing information about instruments held in public museums. From the violin images, we derive a set of measurements that reflect relevant geometrical features of the instruments. The application of Principal Component Analysis (PCA) uncovered similarities between violin makers and their respective copyists, as well as among luthiers belonging to the same family lineage, in the context of historical narrative. Combined with a time-windowed approach, thin plate splines visualizations revealed that the average violin outline has remained mostly stable over time, not adhering to any particular trends of design across different periods in music history.

自16世纪Cremonese学校建立的地标以来，小提琴设计的历史就以实验为标志。虽然科学界自19世纪初以来在研究小提琴声学方面付出了巨大努力，但对小提琴形状随时间演变的统计特征的关注却很少。在本文中，我们研究了从乐器博物馆在线（MIMO）数据库中检索到的小提琴的形态 - 这是最大的免费平台，提供有关公共博物馆中的乐器的信息。从小提琴图像中，我们得出一组反映仪器相关几何特征的测量值。主成分分析（PCA）的应用揭示了在历史叙事的背景下，小提琴制作者和他们各自的抄写者之间以及属于同一家族的制琴师之间的相似之处。结合时间窗口方法，薄板样条可视化显示平均小提琴轮廓随时间保持大部分稳定，而不是在音乐历史的不同时期遵循任何特定的设计趋势。
