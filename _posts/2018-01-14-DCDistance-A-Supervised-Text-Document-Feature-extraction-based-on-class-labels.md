##### Abstract
Text Mining is a field that aims at extracting information from textual data. One of the challenges of such field of study comes from the pre-processing stage in which a vector (and structured) representation should be extracted from unstructured data. The common extraction creates large and sparse vectors representing the importance of each term to a document. As such, this usually leads to the curse-of-dimensionality that plagues most machine learning algorithms. To cope with this issue, in this paper we propose a new supervised feature extraction and reduction algorithm, named DCDistance, that creates features based on the distance between a document to a representative of each class label. As such, the proposed technique can reduce the features set in more than 99% of the original set. Additionally, this algorithm was also capable of improving the classification accuracy over a set of benchmark datasets when compared to traditional and state-of-the-art features selection algorithms.

文本挖掘是一个旨在从文本数据中提取信息的领域。这种研究领域的挑战之一来自预处理阶段，在这个阶段中，应该从非结构化数据中提取出一个向量（和结构化）表示。常见的提取创建了大型稀疏矢量来表示每个词对文档的重要性。因此，这通常会导致困扰大多数机器学习算法的维度灾难（curse-of-dimensionality）。针对这个问题，本文提出了一种新的有监督的特征提取和缩减算法DCDistance，它基于文档到每个类别标签代表的距离来创建特征。因此，所提出的技术可以减少超过99％的原始组中设置的特征。另外，与传统和最先进的特征选择算法相比，该算法还能够改善一组基准数据集的分类准确性。
