##### Abstract
The recent increase in the use of aerial vehicles raises concerns about the safety and reliability of autonomous operations. There is a growing need for methods to monitor the status of these aircraft and report any faults and anomalies to the safety pilot or to the autopilot to deal with the emergency situation. In this paper, we present a real-time approach using the Recursive Least Squares method to detect anomalies in the behavior of an aircraft. The method models the relationship between correlated input-output pairs online and uses the model to detect the anomalies. The result is an easy-to-deploy anomaly detection method that does not assume a specific aircraft model and can detect many types of faults and anomalies in a wide range of autonomous aircraft. The experiments on this method show a precision of $88.23\%$, recall of $88.23\%$ and $86.36\%$ accuracy for over 22 flight tests. The other contribution is providing a new fault detection open dataset for autonomous aircraft, which contains complete data and the ground truth for 22 fixed-wing flights with eight different types of mid-flight actuator failures to help future fault detection research for aircraft.
