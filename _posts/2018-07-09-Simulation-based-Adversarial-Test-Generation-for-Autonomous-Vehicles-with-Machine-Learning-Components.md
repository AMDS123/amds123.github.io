##### Abstract
Many organizations are developing autonomous driving systems, which are expected to be deployed at a large scale in the near future. Despite this, there is a lack of agreement on appropriate methods to test, debug, and certify the performance of these systems. One of the main challenges is that many autonomous driving systems have machine learning components, such as deep neural networks, for which formal properties are difficult to characterize. We present a testing framework that is compatible with test case generation and automatic falsification methods, which are used to evaluate cyber-physical systems. We demonstrate how the framework can be used to evaluate closed-loop properties of an autonomous driving system model that includes the ML components, all within a virtual environment. We demonstrate how to use test case generation methods, such as covering arrays, as well as requirement falsification methods to automatically identify problematic test scenarios. The resulting framework can be used to increase the reliability of autonomous driving systems.

许多组织正在开发自动驾驶系统，预计将在不久的将来大规模部署。尽管如此，对于测试，调试和认证这些系统性能的适当方法缺乏一致意见。主要挑战之一是许多自动驾驶系统具有机器学习组件，例如深度神经网络，其形式特性难以表征。我们提出了一个与测试用例生成和自动伪造方法兼容的测试框架，这些方法用于评估网络物理系统。我们演示了框架如何用于评估包含ML组件的自动驾驶系统模型的闭环属性，所有这些都在虚拟环境中。我们演示了如何使用测试用例生成方法（如覆盖数组）以及需求伪造方法来自动识别有问题的测试场景。由此产生的框架可用于提高自动驾驶系统的可靠性。
