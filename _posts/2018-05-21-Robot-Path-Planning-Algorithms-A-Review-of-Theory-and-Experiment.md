##### Abstract
The aim of this book is to introduce different robot path planning algorithms and suggest some of the most appropriate ones which are capable of running on a variety of robots and are resistant to disturbances. Being real-time, being autonomous, and the ability to identify high risk areas and risk management are the other features that will be mentioned throughout these methods. As such, the first chapter of the book provides an introduction on the importance of robots and describes the subject of navigation and path planning. The second chapter deals with the topic of path planning in unknown environments. In Chapter 3, path planning is considered in known environments. The fourth chapter focuses on robot path planning based on the robot vision sensors and computing hardware. Finally, In Chapter 5, the performance of some of the most important path planning methods introduced in the second to fourth chapters are presented in terms of implementation in various environments.

##### Abstract (translated by Google)
本书的目的是介绍不同的机器人路径规划算法，并提出一些能够在各种机器人上运行且能够抵抗干扰的最合适的机器人路径规划算法。实时性，自主性以及识别高风险领域和风险管理的能力是这些方法中将要提及的其他特征。因此，本书的第一章介绍了机器人的重要性，并介绍了导航和路径规划的主题。第二章涉及未知环境中的路径规划主题。在第3章中，路径规划是在已知环境中考虑的。第四章重点研究基于机器人视觉传感器和计算硬件的机器人路径规划。最后，在第5章中，介绍了在第二章到第四章中介绍的一些最重要的路径规划方法的性能，并在各种环境中的实现方面进行了介绍。
