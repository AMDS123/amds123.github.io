##### Abstract
Autonomous driving is becoming a reality, yet vehicles still need to rely on complex sensor fusion techniques to fully understand the scene they act in. Being able to discern the static environment from the dynamic entities that populate it, will improve scene comprehension algorithms and will pose constraints to the reasoning process about moving objects. With this in mind, we propose a scene comprehension task aimed at providing a complete understanding of the static surroundings, with a particular attention to road layout. In order to cut to the bare minimum the sensor requirements to be deployed on-board, we solely rely on semantic segmentation masks, which can be reliably obtained with computer vision algorithms from any RGB source. We cast this problem as an inpainting task based on a Generative Adversarial Network model to remove all dynamic objects from the scene and focus on understanding its static components such as streets, sidewalks and buildings. We evaluate this task on a synthetically generated dataset obtained with the CARLA simulator, demonstrating the effectiveness of our method.

自主驾驶正在成为现实，但车辆仍然需要依靠复杂的传感器融合技术来充分理解他们所处的场景。能够从其动态实体中辨别静态环境将改善场景理解算法，并且将构成对移动对象的推理过程的约束。考虑到这一点，我们提出了一个场景理解任务，旨在提供对静态环境的完整理解，并特别关注道路布局。为了最大限度地减少要部署在板上的传感器需求，我们完全依赖语义分割掩模，这可以通过任何RGB源的计算机视觉算法可靠地获得。我们将这个问题作为基于生成敌对网络模型的修复任务来解决，以从场景中移除所有动态对象，并专注于理解其静态组件，如街道，人行道和建筑物。我们用CARLA模拟器获得的综合生成的数据集评估这项任务，证明了我们方法的有效性。
