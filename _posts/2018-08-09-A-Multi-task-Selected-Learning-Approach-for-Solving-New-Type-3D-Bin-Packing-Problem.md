##### Abstract
This paper studies a new type of 3D bin packing problem (BPP), in which a number of cuboid-shaped items must be put into a bin one by one orthogonally. The objective is to find a way to place these items that can minimize the surface area of the bin. This problem is based on the fact that there is no fixed-sized bin in many real business scenarios and the cost of a bin is proportional to its surface area. Based on previous research on 3D BPP, the surface area is determined by the sequence, spatial locations and orientations of items. It is a new NP-hard combinatorial optimization problem on unfixed-sized bin packing, for which we propose a multi-task framework based on Selected Learning, generating the sequence and orientations of items packed into the bin simultaneously. During training steps, Selected Learning chooses one of loss functions derived from Deep Reinforcement Learning and Supervised Learning corresponding to the training procedure. Numerical results show that the method proposed significantly outperforms Lego baselines by a substantial gain of 7.52%. Moreover, we produce large scale 3D Bin Packing order data set for studying bin packing problems and will release it to the research community.

本文研究了一种新型的3D装箱问题（BPP），其中许多长方体形状的物品必须逐个正交地放入箱中。目的是找到一种方法来放置这些可以最小化箱子表面积的物品。该问题基于以下事实：在许多实际业务场景中没有固定大小的箱，并且箱的成本与其表面积成比例。基于先前对3D BPP的研究，表面积由物品的序列，空间位置和方向决定。这是一个新的NP-hard组合优化问题，对于不固定大小的bin包装，我们提出了一个基于Selected Learning的多任务框架，同时生成打包到bin中的项目的顺序和方向。在训练步骤中，选择学习选择与训练程序相对应的深度强化学习和监督学习中的一种损失函数。数值结果表明，该方法显着优于乐高基线7.5.2％的实质性增益。此外，我们还生产大规模的3D Bin Packing订单数据集，用于研究bin包装问题，并将其发布给研究界。
