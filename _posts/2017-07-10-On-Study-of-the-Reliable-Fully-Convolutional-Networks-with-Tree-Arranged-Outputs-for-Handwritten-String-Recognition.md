##### Abstract
The handwritten string recognition is still a challengeable task, though the powerful deep learning tools were introduced. In this paper, based on TAO-FCN, we proposed an end-to-end system for handwritten string recognition. Compared with the conventional methods, there is no preprocess nor manually designed rules employed. With enough labelled data, it is easy to apply the proposed method to different applications. Although the performance of the proposed method may not be comparable with the state-of-the-art approaches, it's usability and robustness are more meaningful for practical applications.

尽管引入了强大的深度学习工具，手写的字符串识别仍然是一个挑战性的任务。本文在TAO-FCN的基础上，提出了一种手写字符串识别的端到端系统。与传统方法相比，没有预处理，也没有人工设计的规则。用足够的标记数据，很容易将所提出的方法应用于不同的应用。虽然所提出的方法的性能可能不能与最先进的方法相比，但是对于实际应用来说，可用性和鲁棒性更有意义。
