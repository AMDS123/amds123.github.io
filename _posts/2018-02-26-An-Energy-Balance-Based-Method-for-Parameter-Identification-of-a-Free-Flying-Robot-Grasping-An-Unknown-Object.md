##### Abstract
The estimation of inertial parameters of a robotic system is crucial for better trajectory tracking performance, specially when model-based controllers are used for carrying out precise tasks. In this paper, we consider the scenario of grasping an object of unknown properties by a free-flyer space robot with limited actuation. The problem is to find the inertial parameters of the complete system after grasping has been performed. Excitation is provided in inertial space, and the excitation trajectories are found by optimization. Truncated Fourier series are used to represent the reference as well as tracked trajectory. An approach based on the energy balance between the actuation work and the rate of change of kinetic energy is introduced to calculate the number of harmonics in the Fourier series used to represent the executed trajectory, while trying to find a balance between accounting for saturation effects and keeping out noise. The effect of input saturation on parameter estimation is also studied. Simulation results using the Space CoBot free-flyer robot are presented to show the feasibility of the approach.

机器人系统的惯性参数估计对于更好的轨迹跟踪性能至关重要，特别是当基于模型的控制器用于执行精确任务时。在本文中，我们考虑通过具有有限致动的自由飞行空间机器人来抓握未知属性的物体的情形。问题是在抓取完成后找到整个系统的惯性参数。励磁在惯性空间中提供，激励轨迹通过优化找到。截断傅里叶级数用于表示参考以及跟踪轨迹。基于致动功与动能变化率之间的能量平衡的方法被引入以计算用于表示执行的轨迹的傅里叶级数中的谐波数量，同时试图在计算饱和效应与排除噪音。还研究了输入饱和对参数估计的影响。展示了使用空间CoBot自由飞行器机器人的仿真结果，以显示该方法的可行性。
