##### Abstract
This paper proposes a framework designed to generate a closed-loop walking engine for a humanoid robot. In particular, the core of this framework is an abstract dynamics model which is composed of two masses that represent the lower and the upper body of a humanoid robot. Moreover, according to the proposed dynamics model, the low-level controller is formulated as a Linear-Quadratic-Gaussian (LQG) controller that is able to robustly track the desired trajectories. Besides, this framework is fully parametric which allows using an optimization algorithm to find the optimum parameters. To examine the performance of the proposed framework, a set of simulation using a simulated Nao robot in the RoboCup 3D simulation environment has been carried out. Simulation results show that the proposed framework is capable of providing fast and reliable omnidirectional walking. After optimizing the parameters using genetic algorithm (GA), the maximum forward walking velocity that we have achieved was $80.5cm/s$.
