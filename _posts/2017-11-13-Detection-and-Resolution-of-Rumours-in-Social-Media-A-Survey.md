##### Abstract
Despite the increasing use of social media platforms for information and news gathering, its unmoderated nature often leads to the emergence and spread of rumours, i.e. pieces of information that are unverified at the time of posting. At the same time, the openness of social media platforms provides opportunities to study how users share and discuss rumours, and to explore how natural language processing and data mining techniques may be used to find ways of determining their veracity. In this survey we introduce and discuss two types of rumours that circulate on social media; long-standing rumours that circulate for long periods of time, and newly-emerging rumours spawned during fast-paced events such as breaking news, where reports are released piecemeal and often with an unverified status in their early stages. We provide an overview of research into social media rumours with the ultimate goal of developing a rumour classification system that consists of four components: rumour detection, rumour tracking, rumour stance classification and rumour veracity classification. We delve into the approaches presented in the scientific literature for the development of each of these four components. We summarise the efforts and achievements so far towards the development of rumour classification systems and conclude with suggestions for avenues for future research in social media mining for detection and resolution of rumours.

##### Abstract (translated by Google)
尽管社交媒体平台越来越多地用于信息和新闻采访，但是它的未被塑造的性质常常导致谣言的出现和传播，即在发布时未被证实的信息片段。与此同时，社交媒体平台的开放性为研究用户如何分享和讨论谣言提供了机会，并探讨了如何使用自然语言处理和数据挖掘技术来找到确定其真实性的方法。在这次调查中，我们介绍和讨论在社交媒体上流传的两种类型的谣言;长时间流传的长期传闻，以及在快节奏事件（如突发新闻）中产生的新兴传闻，报告在零碎的地方被发布，并且在早期阶段通常具有未被证实的地位。我们提供了一个关于社交媒体谣言研究的概述，其最终目标是开发一个由四部分组成的谣言分类系统：谣言检测，谣言追踪，谣言立场分类和谣言准确性分类。我们深入研究了这四个组成部分各自发展的科学文献。总结了目前谣言分类体系发展的努力和取得的成果，并提出了未来舆情挖掘谣言检测和解决研究的途径。
