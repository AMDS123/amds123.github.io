##### Abstract
Light fields become a popular representation of three dimensional scenes, and there is interest in their processing, resampling, and compression. As those operations often result in loss of quality, there is a need to quantify it. In this work, we collect a new dataset of dense reference and distorted light fields as well as the corresponding quality scores which are scaled in perceptual units. The scores were acquired in a subjective experiment using an interactive light-field viewing setup. The dataset contains typical artifacts that occur in light-field processing chain due to light-field reconstruction, multi-view compression, and limitations of automultiscopic displays. We test a number of existing objective quality metrics to determine how well they can predict the quality of light fields. We find that the existing image quality metrics provide good measures of light-field quality, but require dense reference light- fields for optimal performance. For more complex tasks of comparing two distorted light fields, their performance drops significantly, which reveals the need for new, light-field-specific metrics.

光场成为三维场景的流行表现，对其处理，重采样和压缩有兴趣。由于这些操作往往导致质量损失，因此有必要对其进行量化。在这项工作中，我们收集密集参考和扭曲光场的新数据集，以及相应的感知单位的质量得分。评分是在主观实验中使用交互式光场观察设置获得的。该数据集包含由于光场重建，多视图压缩以及自动聚焦显示器的限制而在光场处理链中发生的典型伪像。我们测试了一些现有的客观质量指标，以确定他们可以预测光场的质量。我们发现，现有的图像质量指标提供了良好的光场质量度量，但需要密集参考光场以获得最佳性能。对于比较两个失真光场的更复杂的任务，其性能显着下降，这表明需要新的，特定于光场的度量。
