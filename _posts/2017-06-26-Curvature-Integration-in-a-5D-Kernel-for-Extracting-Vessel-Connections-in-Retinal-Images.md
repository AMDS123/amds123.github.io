##### Abstract
Tree-like structures such as retinal images are widely studied in computer-aided diagnosis systems for large-scale screening programs. Despite several segmentation and tracking methods proposed in the literature, there still exist several limitations specifically when two or more curvilinear structures cross or bifurcate, or in the presence of interrupted lines or highly curved blood vessels. In this paper, we propose a novel approach based on multi-orientation scores augmented with a contextual affinity matrix, which both are inspired by the geometry of the primary visual cortex (V1) and their contextual connections. The connectivity is described with a five-dimensional kernel obtained as the fundamental solution of the Fokker-Planck equation modelling the cortical connectivity in the lifted space of positions, orientations, curvatures and intensity. It is further used in a self-tuning spectral clustering step to identify the main perceptual units in the stimuli. The proposed method has been validated on several easy and challenging structures in a set of artificial images and actual retinal patches. Supported by quantitative and qualitative results, the method is capable of overcoming the limitations of current state-of-the-art techniques.

##### Abstract (translated by Google)
用于大规模筛选计划的计算机辅助诊断系统广泛研究像视网膜图像之类的树状结构。尽管在文献中提出了几种分割和跟踪方法，但是当两个或多个曲线结构交叉或分叉时，或者在存在中断线或高度弯曲的血管时，仍然存在若干限制。在本文中，我们提出了一种新颖的方法基于多方位分数与上下文亲和矩阵增强，这两者都受到初级视觉皮层（V1）的几何和他们的上下文连接的启发。连通性被描述为一个五维核心，这个核心是Fokker-Planck方程的基本解决方案，这个方程在位置，方向，曲率和强度的提升空间建模皮质连接。它进一步用于自调谐谱聚类步骤中以识别刺激中的主要感知单位。所提出的方法已经在一组人造图像和实际视网膜贴片中的几个简单且具有挑战性的结构上得到验证。通过定量和定性结果的支持，该方法能够克服当前最新技术的局限性。
