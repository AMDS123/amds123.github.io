##### Abstract
The ubiquitous role of the cyber-infrastructures, such as the WWW, provides myriad opportunities for machine learning and its broad spectrum of application domains taking advantage of digital communication. Pattern classification and feature extraction are among the first applications of machine learning that have received extensive attention. The most remarkable achievements have addressed data sets of moderate-to-large size. The 'data deluge' in the last decade or two has posed new challenges for AI researchers to design new, effective and accurate algorithms for similar tasks using ultra-massive data sets and complex (natural or synthetic) dynamical systems. We propose a novel principled approach to feature extraction in hybrid architectures comprised of humans and machines in networked communication, who collaborate to solve a pre-assigned pattern recognition (feature extraction) task. There are two practical considerations addressed below: (1) Human experts, such as plant biologists or astronomers, often use their visual perception and other implicit prior knowledge or expertise without any obvious constraints to search for the significant features, whereas machines are limited to a pre-programmed set of criteria to work with; (2) in a team collaboration of collective problem solving, the human experts have diverse abilities that are complementary, and they learn from each other to succeed in cognitively complex tasks in ways that are still impossible imitate by machines.
