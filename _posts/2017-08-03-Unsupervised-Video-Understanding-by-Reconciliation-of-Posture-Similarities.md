##### Abstract
Understanding human activity and being able to explain it in detail surpasses mere action classification by far in both complexity and value. The challenge is thus to describe an activity on the basis of its most fundamental constituents, the individual postures and their distinctive transitions. Supervised learning of such a fine-grained representation based on elementary poses is very tedious and does not scale. Therefore, we propose a completely unsupervised deep learning procedure based solely on video sequences, which starts from scratch without requiring pre-trained networks, predefined body models, or keypoints. A combinatorial sequence matching algorithm proposes relations between frames from subsets of the training data, while a CNN is reconciling the transitivity conflicts of the different subsets to learn a single concerted pose embedding despite changes in appearance across sequences. Without any manual annotation, the model learns a structured representation of postures and their temporal development. The model not only enables retrieval of similar postures but also temporal super-resolution. Additionally, based on a recurrent formulation, next frames can be synthesized.

了解人类活动并能详细解释它在复杂性和价值性方面远远超过了单纯的行动分类。因此，挑战是根据其最基本的组成部分，个人姿态及其独特的过渡来描述活动。基于基本姿势的这种细粒度表示的监督式学习非常繁琐且不规模。因此，我们提出一个完全无监督的深度学习程序，完全基于视频序列，从头开始，不需要预先训练的网络，预定义的身体模型或关键点。组合序列匹配算法提出来自训练数据子集的帧之间的关系，而CNN协调不同子集的传递性冲突，以学习单个协调的姿态嵌入，尽管跨越序列的外观变化。没有任何手工注释，该模型学习姿势的结构化表示及其时间发展。该模型不仅可以检索类似的姿势，而且还可以获得时间上的超分辨率。另外，基于循环公式，可以合成下一帧。
