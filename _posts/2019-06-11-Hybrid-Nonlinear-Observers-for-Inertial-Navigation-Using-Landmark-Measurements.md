##### Abstract
This paper considers the problem of attitude, position and linear velocity estimation for rigid body systems relying on landmark measurements. We propose two hybrid nonlinear observers on the matrix Lie group $SE_2(3)$, leading to global exponential stability. The first observer relies on fixed gains, while the second one uses variable gains depending on the solution of a continuous Riccati equation (CRE). These observers are then extended to handle biased angular velocity measurements. Both simulation and experimental results are presented to illustrate the performance of the proposed observers.
