##### Abstract
This paper aims at synthesizing filamentary structured images such as retinal fundus images and neuronal images, as follows: Given a ground-truth, to generate multiple realistic looking phantoms. A ground-truth could be a binary segmentation map containing the filamentary structured morphology, while the synthesized output image is of the same size as the ground-truth and has similar visual appearance to what have been presented in the training set. Our approach is inspired by the recent progresses in generative adversarial nets (GANs) as well as image style transfer. In particular, it is dedicated to our problem context with the following properties: Rather than large-scale dataset, it works well in the presence of as few as 10 training examples, which is common in medical image analysis; It is capable of synthesizing diverse images from the same ground-truth; Last and importantly, the synthetic images produced by our approach are demonstrated to be useful in boosting image analysis performance. Empirical examination over various benchmarks of fundus and neuronal images demonstrate the advantages of the proposed approach.

本文旨在综合纤维结构图像，如视网膜眼底图像和神经元图像，如下所示：给出一个基本事实，生成多个逼真的幻像。地面实况可以是包含细丝状结构形态的二进制分割图，而合成的输出图像与地面实况具有相同的尺寸，并具有与训练集中呈现的类似的视觉外观。我们的方法受到生成对抗网络（GAN）最近的进展以及图像风格转换的启发。具体来说，它是针对我们的问题上下文具有以下属性：而不是大规模的数据集，它在少至10个训练实例的情况下运行良好，这在医学图像分析中是常见的;它能够从相同的地面真相综合不同的图像;最后，重要的是，我们的方法产生的合成图像被证明是有用的提高图像分析性能。眼底和神经元图像的各种基准的实证检验证明了所提出的方法的优点。
