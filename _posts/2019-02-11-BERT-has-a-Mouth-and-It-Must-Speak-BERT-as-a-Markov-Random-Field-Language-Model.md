##### Abstract
We show that BERT (Devlin et al., 2018) is a Markov random field language model. Formulating BERT in this way gives way to a natural procedure to sample sentence from BERT. We sample sentences from BERT and find that it can produce high-quality, fluent generations. Compared to the generations of a traditional left-to-right language model, BERT generates sentences that are more diverse but of slightly worse quality.
