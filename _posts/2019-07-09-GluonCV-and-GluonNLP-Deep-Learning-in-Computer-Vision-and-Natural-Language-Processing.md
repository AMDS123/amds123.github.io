##### Abstract
We present GluonCV and GluonNLP, the deep learning toolkits for computer vision and natural language processing based on Apache MXNet (incubating). These toolkits provide state-of-the-art pre-trained models, training scripts, and training logs, to facilitate rapid prototyping and promote reproducible research. We also provide modular APIs with flexible building blocks to enable efficient customization. Leveraging the MXNet ecosystem, the deep learning models in GluonCV and GluonNLP can be deployed onto a variety of platforms with different programming languages. Benefiting from open source under the Apache 2.0 license, GluonCV and GluonNLP have attracted 100 contributors worldwide on GitHub. Models of GluonCV and GluonNLP have been downloaded for more than 1.6 million times in fewer than 10 months.
