##### Abstract
Mutual usage of vehicles as well as car sharing became more and more attractive during the last years. Especially in urban environments with limited parking possibilities and a higher risk for traffic jams, car rentals and sharing services may save time and money. But when renting a vehicle it could already be damaged (e.g., scratches or bumps inflicted by a previous user) without the damage being perceived by the service provider. In order to address such problems, we present an automated, motion-based system for impact detection, that facilitates a common smartphone as a sensor platform. The system is capable of detecting the impact segment and the point of time of an impact event on a vehicle's surface, as well as its direction of origin. With this additional specific knowledge, it may be possible to reconstruct the circumstances of an impact event, e.g., to prove possible innocence of a service's customer.

在过去的几年中，车辆的相互使用以及汽车共享变得越来越有吸引力。特别是在停车可能性较低，交通堵塞风险较高的城市环境中，租车和共享服务可能会节省时间和金钱。但是当租用车辆时，它可能已经被损坏（例如，前一个用户所造成的划痕或颠簸），而服务提供者没有察觉到损坏。为了解决这些问题，我们提出了一个自动化的，基于运动的影响检测系统，这有助于普通的智能手机作为传感器平台。该系统能够检测车辆表面上的撞击事件和撞击事件的时间点以及撞击事件的发生方向。有了这些额外的具体知识，就有可能重新构建影响事件的情况，例如证明服务的客户可能是清白的。
