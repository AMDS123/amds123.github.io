##### Abstract
Real-time detection of moving objects involves memorisation of features in the template image and their comparison with those in the test image. At high sampling rates, such techniques face the problems of high algorithmic complexity and component delays. We present a new resistive switching based threshold logic cell which encodes the pixels of a template image. The cell comprises a voltage divider circuit that programs the resistances of the memristors arranged in a single node threshold logic network and the output is encoded as a binary value using a CMOS inverter gate. When a test image is applied to the template-programmed cell, a mismatch in the respective pixels is seen as a change in the output voltage of the cell. The proposed cell when compared with CMOS equivalent implementation shows improved performance in area, leakage power, power dissipation and delay.
