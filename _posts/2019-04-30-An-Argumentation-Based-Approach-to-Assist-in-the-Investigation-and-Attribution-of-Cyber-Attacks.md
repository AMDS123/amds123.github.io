##### Abstract
We expect an increase in frequency and severity of cyber-attacks that comes along with the need of efficient security countermeasures. The process of attributing a cyber-attack helps in constructing efficient and targeted mitigative and preventive security measures. In this work, we propose an argumentation-based reasoner (ABR) that helps the analyst during the analysis of forensic evidence and the attribution process. Given the evidence collected from the cyber-attack, our reasoner helps the analyst to identify who performed the attack and suggests the analyst where to focus further analyses by giving hints of the missing evidence, or further investigation paths to follow. ABR is the first automatic reasoner that analyzes and attributes cyber-attacks by using technical and social evidence, as well as incomplete and conflicting information. ABR was tested on realistic cyber-attacks cases.
