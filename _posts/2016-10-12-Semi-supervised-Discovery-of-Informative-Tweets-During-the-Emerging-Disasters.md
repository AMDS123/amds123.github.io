##### Abstract
The first objective towards the effective use of microblogging services such as Twitter for situational awareness during the emerging disasters is discovery of the disaster-related postings. Given the wide range of possible disasters, using a pre-selected set of disaster-related keywords for the discovery is suboptimal. An alternative that we focus on in this work is to train a classifier using a small set of labeled postings that are becoming available as a disaster is emerging. Our hypothesis is that utilizing large quantities of historical microblogs could improve the quality of classification, as compared to training a classifier only on the labeled data. We propose to use unlabeled microblogs to cluster words into a limited number of clusters and use the word clusters as features for classification. To evaluate the proposed semi-supervised approach, we used Twitter data from 6 different disasters. Our results indicate that when the number of labeled tweets is 100 or less, the proposed approach is superior to the standard classification based on the bag or words feature representation. Our results also reveal that the choice of the unlabeled corpus, the choice of word clustering algorithm, and the choice of hyperparameters can have a significant impact on the classification accuracy.

在新兴灾难期间有效利用Twitter等微博服务进行态势感知的首要目标是发现与灾难有关的信息。鉴于可能发生的各种灾难，使用事先选定的与灾难有关的关键字来进行发现并不理想。我们在这项工作中重点关注的另一个方法是使用一小组标记的帖子来训练一个分类器，这些帖子在灾难出现时正在变得可用。我们的假设是利用大量的历史微博可以提高分类的质量，相比之下，仅在标记的数据上训练分类器。我们建议使用未标记的微博将单词聚类到有限数量的聚类中，并使用单词聚类作为分类的特征。为了评估所提出的半监督方法，我们使用了来自6个不同灾难的Twitter数据。我们的结果表明，当标签推文的数量是100或更少时，所提出的方法优于基于袋或词特征表示的标准分类。我们的研究结果还表明，未标记语料库的选择，词汇聚类算法的选择以及超参数的选择都会对分类精度产生重大影响。
