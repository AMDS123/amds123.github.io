##### Abstract
We compare a novel Knowledge-based Reinforcement Learning (KB-RL) approach with the traditional Neural Network (NN) method in solving a classical task of the Artificial Intelligence (AI) field. Neural networks became very prominent in recent years and, combined with Reinforcement Learning, proved to be very effective for one of the frontier challenges in AI - playing the game of Go. Our experiment shows that a KB-RL system is able to outperform a NN in a task typical for NN, such as optimizing a regression problem. Furthermore, KB-RL offers a range of advantages in comparison to the traditional Machine Learning methods. Particularly, there is no need for a large dataset to start and succeed with this approach, its learning process takes considerably less effort, and its decisions are fully controllable, explicit and predictable.
