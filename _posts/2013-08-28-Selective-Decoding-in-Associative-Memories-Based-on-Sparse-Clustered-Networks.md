##### Abstract
Associative memories are structures that can retrieve previously stored information given a partial input pattern instead of an explicit address as in indexed memories. A few hardware approaches have recently been introduced for a new family of associative memories based on Sparse-Clustered Networks (SCN) that show attractive features. These architectures are suitable for implementations with low retrieval latency, but are limited to small networks that store a few hundred data entries. In this paper, a new hardware architecture of SCNs is proposed that features a new data-storage technique as well as a method we refer to as Selective Decoding (SD-SCN). The SD-SCN has been implemented using a similar FPGA used in the previous efforts and achieves two orders of magnitude higher capacity, with no error-performance penalty but with the cost of few extra clock cycles per data access.

联想记忆是一种结构，它可以检索先前存储的信息，给定部分输入模式，而不是像索引存储器中那样显式地址。最近已经引入了一些基于稀疏群集网络（SCN）的新型关联存储器的硬件​​方法，这些方法显示出有吸引力的特征。这些体系结构适用于低检索延迟的实现，但仅限于存储数百个数据条目的小型网络。在本文中，提出了一种新的SCN的硬件体系结构，其具有新的数据存储技术以及我们称为选择性解码（SD-SCN）的方法。 SD-SCN的实现使用了前面所使用的类似的FPGA，并且实现了两个数量级的更高容量，没有错误性能的损失，但是每个数据访问的额外时钟周期很少。
