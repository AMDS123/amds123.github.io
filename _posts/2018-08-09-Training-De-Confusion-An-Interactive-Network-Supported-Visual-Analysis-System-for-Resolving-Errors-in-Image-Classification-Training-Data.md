##### Abstract
Convolutional neural networks gain more and more popularity in image classification tasks since they are often even able to outperform human classifiers. While much research has been targeted towards network architecture optimization, the optimization of the labeled training data has not been explicitly targeted yet. Since labeling of training data is time-consuming, it is often performed by less experienced domain experts or even outsourced to online services. Unfortunately, this results in labeling errors, which directly impact the classification performance of the trained network. To overcome this problem, we propose an interactive visual analysis system that helps to spot and correct errors in the training dataset. For this purpose, we have identified instance interpretation errors, class interpretation errors and similarity errors as frequently occurring errors, which shall be resolved to improve classification performance. After we detect these errors, users are guided towards them through a two-step visual analysis process, in which they can directly reassign labels to resolve the detected errors. Thus, with the proposed visual analysis system, the user has to inspect far fewer items to resolve labeling errors in the training dataset, and thus arrives at satisfying training results more quickly.

卷积神经网络在图像分类任务中越来越受欢迎，因为它们通常甚至能够胜过人类分类器。虽然许多研究都针对网络架构优化，但标记的训练数据的优化尚未明确针对。由于标记培训数据非常耗时，因此通常由经验不足的领域专家执行，甚至外包给在线服务。不幸的是，这导致标记错误，这直接影响训练网络的分类性能。为了克服这个问题，我们提出了一个交互式可视化分析系统，该系统有助于发现和纠正训练数据集中的错误。为此，我们将实例解释错误，类解释错误和相似性错误识别为频繁发生的错误，这些错误应被解决以提高分类性能。在我们检测到这些错误后，将通过两步可视化分析过程引导用户，他们可以直接重新分配标签以解决检测到的错误。因此，利用所提出的视觉分析系统，用户必须检查更少的项目以解决训练数据集中的标记错误，并因此更快地得到满意的训练结果。
