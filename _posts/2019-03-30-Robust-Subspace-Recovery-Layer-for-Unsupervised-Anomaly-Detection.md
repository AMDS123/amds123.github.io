##### Abstract
We propose a neural network for unsupervised anomaly detection with a novel robust subspace recovery layer (RSR layer). This layer seeks to extract the underlying subspace from a latent representation of the given data and remove outliers that lie away from this subspace. It is used together with an encoder and a decoder. The encoder maps the data into the latent space, from which the RSR layer extracts the subspace. The decoder then smoothly maps back the underlying subspace to a ``manifold" close to the original data. We illustrate algorithmic choices and performance for artificial data with corrupted manifold structure. We also demonstrate competitive precision and recall for image datasets.
