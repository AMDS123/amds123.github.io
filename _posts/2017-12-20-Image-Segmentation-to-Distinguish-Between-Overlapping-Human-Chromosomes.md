##### Abstract
In medicine, visualizing chromosomes is important for medical diagnostics, drug development, and biomedical research. Unfortunately, chromosomes often overlap and it is necessary to identify and distinguish between the overlapping chromosomes. A segmentation solution that is fast and automated will enable scaling of cost effective medicine and biomedical research. We apply neural network-based image segmentation to the problem of distinguishing between partially overlapping DNA chromosomes. A convolutional neural network is customized for this problem. The results achieved intersection over union (IOU) scores of 94.7% for the overlapping region and 88-94% on the non-overlapping chromosome regions.

在医学上，染色体的可视化对于医学诊断，药物开发和生物医学研究非常重要。不幸的是，染色体往往重叠，有必要识别和区分重叠的染色体。一个快速和自动化的分割解决方案将使成本效益的医学和生物医学研究成为可能。我们将基于神经网络的图像分割应用于区分部分重叠的DNA染色体的问题。卷积神经网络是为这个问题定制的。结果显示重叠区域的交叉点（IOU）分数为94.7％，非重叠染色体区域为88-94％。
