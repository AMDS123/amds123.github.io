##### Abstract
World population is raising, especially the part of people living in cities. With increased population and complex roles regarding their inhabitants and their surroundings, cities concentrate difficulties for design, planning and analysis. These tasks require a way to reconstruct/model a city. Traditionally, much attention has been given to buildings reconstruction, yet an essential part of city were neglected: streets. Streets reconstruction has been seldom researched. Streets are also complex compositions of urban features, and have a unique role for transportation (as they comprise roads). We aim at completing the recent state of the art for building reconstruction (Musialski2012) by considering all other aspect of urban reconstruction. We introduce the need for city models. Because reconstruction always necessitates data, we first analyse which data are available. We then expose a state of the art of street reconstruction, street network reconstruction, urban features reconstruction/modelling, vegetation , and urban objects reconstruction/modelling. Although reconstruction strategies vary widely, we can order them by the role the model plays, from data driven approach, to model-based approach, to inverse procedural modelling and model catalogue matching. The main challenges seems to come from the complex nature of urban environment and from the limitations of the available data. Urban features have strong relationships, between them, and to their surrounding, as well as in hierarchical relations. Procedural modelling has the power to express these relations, and could be applied to the reconstruction of urban features via the Inverse Procedural Modelling paradigm.

世界人口正在增加，尤其是生活在城市中的人群。随着人口和居民及其周围环境的日益复杂化，城市将难以进行设计，规划和分析。这些任务需要一种重建/建模城市的方法。传统上，建筑物重建受到了很多关注，但城市的重要部分却被忽视：街道。很少研究街道重建。街道也是城市特色的复杂组合，并且在交通方面具有独特的作用（因为它们包括道路）。我们的目标是通过考虑城市重建的所有其他方面来完成最近的建筑重建艺术（Musialski2012）。我们介绍对城市模型的需求。由于重建总是需要数据，我们首先分析哪些数据是可用的。然后，我们将揭示街道重建，街道网络重建，城市特征重建/建模，植被和城市对象重建/建模的最新技术。虽然重建策略差异很大，但我们可以通过模型扮演的角色（从数据驱动方法到基于模型的方法），逆向程序化建模和模型目录匹配来命令它们。主要挑战似乎来自城市环境的复杂性以及现有数据的局限性。城市特征与它们之间以及它们周围以及等级关系之间具有强大的关系。程序建模有能力表达这些关系，并且可以通过反向程序建模范式应用于城市特征的重建。
