##### Abstract
In this paper we present a dependency treebank of travel domain sentences in Modern Standard Arabic. The text comes from a translation of the English equivalent sentences in the Basic Traveling Expressions Corpus. The treebank dependency representation is in the style of the Columbia Arabic Treebank. The paper motivates the effort and discusses the construction process and guidelines. We also present parsing results and discuss the effect of domain and genre difference on parsing.
