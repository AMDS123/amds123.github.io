##### Abstract
Users like sharing personal photos with others through social media. At the same time, they might want to make automatic identification in such photos difficult or even impossible. Classic obfuscation methods such as blurring are not only unpleasant but also not as effective as one would expect. Recent studies on adversarial image perturbations (AIP) suggest that it is possible to confuse recognition systems effectively without unpleasant artifacts. However, in the presence of counter measures against AIPs, it is unclear how effective AIP would be in particular when the choice of counter measure is unknown. Game theory provides tools for studying the interaction between agents with uncertainties in the strategies. We introduce a general game theoretical framework for the user-recogniser dynamics, and present a case study that involves current state of the art AIP and person recognition techniques. We derive the optimal strategy for the user that assures an upper bound on the recognition rate independent of the recogniser's counter measure. Code is available at this https URL

用户喜欢通过社交媒体与他人分享个人照片。同时，他们可能想要在这样的照片上进行自动识别困难甚至是不可能的。经典的混淆方法，如模糊不仅令人不快，而且也不如人们期望的那样有效。最近对敌意图像扰动（AIP）的研究表明，有可能有效地将识别系统混淆而没有令人不愉快的伪影。但是，在对抗AIPs的反措施存在的情况下，当反措施的选择是未知的时候，特别是如何有效的AIP是不明确的。博弈论为研究战略中存在不确定性的主体之间的相互作用提供了工具。我们介绍了用户识别器动态的一般游戏理论框架，并介绍了涉及当前最先进的AIP和人员识别技术的案例研究。我们推导出用户的最优策略，确保识别率的上限与识别器的对策无关。代码可在此https网址获得
