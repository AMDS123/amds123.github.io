##### Abstract
Person re-identification (person re-ID) aims at matching target person(s) grabbed from different and non-overlapping camera views. It plays an important role for public safety and has application in various tasks such as, human retrieval, human tracking, and activity analysis. In this paper, we propose a new network architecture called Hierarchical Cross Network (HCN) to perform person re-ID. In addition to the backbone model of a conventional CNN, HCN is equipped with two additional maps called hierarchical cross feature maps. The maps of an HCN are formed by merging layers with different resolutions and semantic levels. With the hierarchical cross feature maps, an HCN can effectively uncover additional semantic features which could not be discovered by a conventional CNN. Although the proposed HCN can discover features with higher semantics, its representation power is still limited. To derive more general representations, we augment the data during the training process by combining multiple datasets. Experiment results show that the proposed method outperformed several state-of-the-art methods.

人员重新识别（人员重新识别）旨在匹配从不同且不重叠的摄像机视图抓取的目标人员。它对公共安全起着重要的作用，可以应用于人体检索，人体跟踪，活动分析等各种任务。在本文中，我们提出了一种称为分层交叉网络（HCN）的新网络架构来执行人员重新身份识别。除了传统CNN的主干模型之外，HCN还配备了两个额外的地图，称为分层交叉特征地图。 HCN的地图是通过合并不同分辨率和语义层次的图层而形成的。通过层次交叉特征映射，HCN可以有效地发现传统CNN无法发现的附加语义特征。虽然提出的HCN能够发现更高语义的特征，但其表征能力仍然有限。为了得到更一般的表示，我们通过组合多个数据集来增加训练过程中的数据。实验结果表明，该方法胜过了几种最先进的方法。
