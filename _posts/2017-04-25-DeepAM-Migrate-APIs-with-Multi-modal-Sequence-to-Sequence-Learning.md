##### Abstract
Computer programs written in one language are often required to be ported to other languages to support multiple devices and environments. When programs use language specific APIs (Application Programming Interfaces), it is very challenging to migrate these APIs to the corresponding APIs written in other languages. Existing approaches mine API mappings from projects that have corresponding versions in two languages. They rely on the sparse availability of bilingual projects, thus producing a limited number of API mappings. In this paper, we propose an intelligent system called DeepAM for automatically mining API mappings from a large-scale code corpus without bilingual projects. The key component of DeepAM is based on the multimodal sequence to sequence learning architecture that aims to learn joint semantic representations of bilingual API sequences from big source code data. Experimental results indicate that DeepAM significantly increases the accuracy of API mappings as well as the number of API mappings, when compared with the state-of-the-art approaches.

##### Abstract (translated by Google)
用一种语言编写的计算机程序通常需要移植到其他语言以支持多种设备和环境。当程序使用语言特定的API（应用程序编程接口）时，将这些API迁移到用其他语言编写的相应API是非常具有挑战性的。现有的方法从具有两种语言的相应版本的项目挖掘API映射。他们依赖双语项目的稀少可用性，从而产生有限数量的API映射。在本文中，我们提出了一个称为DeepAM的智能系统，用于从没有双语项目的大规模代码语料库中自动挖掘API映射。 DeepAM的关键组件是基于多模式序列的序列学习架构，旨在从大的源代码数据中学习双语API序列的联合语义表示。实验结果表明，与最先进的方法相比，DeepAM显着提高了API映射的准确性以及API映射的数量。
