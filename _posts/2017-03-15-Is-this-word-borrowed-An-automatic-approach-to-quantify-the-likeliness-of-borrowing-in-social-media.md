##### Abstract
Code-mixing or code-switching are the effortless phenomena of natural switching between two or more languages in a single conversation. Use of a foreign word in a language; however, does not necessarily mean that the speaker is code-switching because often languages borrow lexical items from other languages. If a word is borrowed, it becomes a part of the lexicon of a language; whereas, during code-switching, the speaker is aware that the conversation involves foreign words or phrases. Identifying whether a foreign word used by a bilingual speaker is due to borrowing or code-switching is a fundamental importance to theories of multilingualism, and an essential prerequisite towards the development of language and speech technologies for multilingual communities. In this paper, we present a series of novel computational methods to identify the borrowed likeliness of a word, based on the social media signals. We first propose context based clustering method to sample a set of candidate words from the social media data.Next, we propose three novel and similar metrics based on the usage of these words by the users in different tweets; these metrics were used to score and rank the candidate words indicating their borrowed likeliness. We compare these rankings with a ground truth ranking constructed through a human judgment experiment. The Spearman's rank correlation between the two rankings (nearly 0.62 for all the three metric variants) is more than double the value (0.26) of the most competitive existing baseline reported in the literature. Some other striking observations are, (i) the correlation is higher for the ground truth data elicited from the younger participants (age less than 30) than that from the older participants, and (ii )those participants who use mixed-language for tweeting the least, provide the best signals of borrowing.

代码混合或代码切换是在单个对话中两种或更多种语言之间自然切换的轻松现象。在一种语言中使用外来词;然而，并不一定意味着说话者是代码转换的，因为通常语言借用来自其他语言的词汇项。如果一个词被借用，它就成为语言词汇的一部分;而在代码切换期间，说话者意识到对话涉及外来词或短语。识别双语者使用的外来词是否是由于借用或代码转换引起的，这是多语言理论的基本重要性，也是多语言社区语言和语音技术发展的基本前提。在本文中，我们提出了一系列新颖的计算方法，基于社交媒体信号来识别借词的可能性。接下来，我们根据用户在不同推文中使用这些词的情况，提出了三种新颖的，相似的度量方法：基于上下文的聚类方法对社交媒体数据中的候选词进行抽样。这些指标被用来评分和排列候选词，表明他们借用的可能性。我们将这些排名与通过人工判断实验构建的地面真实排名进行比较。斯皮尔曼的两个排名之间的排名相关性（所有三个度量变体差不多为0.62）是文献报道的最具竞争力的现有基线的值（0.26）的两倍多。其他一些惊人的观察结果是，（i）年轻参与者（年龄小于30岁）引发的地面实况数据的相关性高于年长参与者，以及（ii）那些使用混合语言推动至少要提供借款的最佳信号。
