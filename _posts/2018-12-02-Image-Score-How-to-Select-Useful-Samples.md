##### Abstract
There has long been debates on how we could interpret neural networks and understand the decisions our models make. Specifically, why deep neural networks tend to be error-prone when dealing with samples that output low softmax scores. We present an efficient approach to measure the confidence of decision-making steps by statistically investigating each unit's contribution to that decision. Instead of focusing on how the models react on datasets, we study the datasets themselves given a pre-trained model. Our approach is capable of assigning a score to each sample within a dataset that measures the frequency of occurrence of that sample's chain of activation. We demonstrate with experiments that our method could select useful samples to improve deep neural networks in a semi-supervised leaning setting.
