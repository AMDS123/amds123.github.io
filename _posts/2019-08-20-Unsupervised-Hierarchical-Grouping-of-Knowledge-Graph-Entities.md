##### Abstract
Knowledge graphs have attracted lots of attention in academic and industrial environments. Despite their usefulness, popular knowledge graphs suffer from incompleteness of information, especially in their type assertions. This has encouraged research in the automatic discovery of entity types. In this context, multiple works were developed to utilize logical inference on ontologies and statistical machine learning methods to learn type assertion in knowledge graphs. However, these approaches suffer from limited performance on noisy data, limited scalability and the dependence on labeled training samples. In this work, we propose a new unsupervised approach that learns to categorize entities into a hierarchy of named groups. We show that our approach is able to effectively learn entity groups using a scalable procedure in noisy and sparse datasets. We experiment our approach on a set of popular knowledge graph benchmarking datasets, and we publish a collection of the outcome group hierarchies.
