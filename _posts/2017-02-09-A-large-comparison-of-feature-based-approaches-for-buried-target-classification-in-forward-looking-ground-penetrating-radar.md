##### Abstract
Forward-looking ground-penetrating radar (FLGPR) has recently been investigated as a remote sensing modality for buried target detection (e.g., landmines). In this context, raw FLGPR data is beamformed into images and then computerized algorithms are applied to automatically detect subsurface buried targets. Most existing algorithms are supervised, meaning they are trained to discriminate between labeled target and non-target imagery, usually based on features extracted from the imagery. A large number of features have been proposed for this purpose, however thus far it is unclear which are the most effective. The first goal of this work is to provide a comprehensive comparison of detection performance using existing features on a large collection of FLGPR data. Fusion of the decisions resulting from processing each feature is also considered. The second goal of this work is to investigate two modern feature learning approaches from the object recognition literature: the bag-of-visual-words and the Fisher vector for FLGPR processing. The results indicate that the new feature learning approaches outperform existing methods. Results also show that fusion between existing features and new features yields little additional performance improvements.

最近研究了前视探地雷达（FLGPR）作为掩埋目标检测（例如地雷）的遥感模式。在这种情况下，原始的FLGPR数据被波束形成为图像，然后使用计算机化的算法来自动检测地下掩埋目标。大多数现有的算法是监督的，这意味着他们被训练来区分标记的目标图像和非目标图像，通常基于从图像提取的特征。为此目的已经提出了许多特征，然而到目前为止还不清楚哪个是最有效的。这项工作的第一个目标是使用大量FLGPR数据集上的现有功能提供检测性能的全面比较。还考虑了处理每个特征所产生的决定的融合。这项工作的第二个目标是调查对象识别文献中的两种现代特征学习方法：FLGPR处理的视觉单词和Fisher矢量。结果表明，新的特征学习方法胜过现有的方法。结果还表明，现有功能与新功能之间的融合几乎没有提高性能。
