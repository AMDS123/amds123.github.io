##### Abstract
Single image super-resolution (SISR) reconstruction for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has generated significant interest because of its potential to not only speed up imaging but to improve quantitative processing and analysis of available image data. Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) have proven to perform well in recovering image texture detail, and many variants have therefore been proposed for SISR. In this work, we develop an enhancement to tackle GAN-based 3D SISR by introducing a new residual-in-residual dense block (RRDG) generator that is both memory efficient and achieves state-of-the-art performance in terms of PSNR (Peak Signal to Noise Ratio), SSIM (Structural Similarity) and NRMSE (Normalized Root Mean Squared Error) metrics. We also introduce a patch GAN discriminator with improved convergence behavior to better model brain image texture. We proposed a novel the anatomical fidelity evaluation of the results using a pre-trained brain parcellation network. Finally, these developments are combined through a simple and efficient method to balance etween image and texture quality in the final output.
