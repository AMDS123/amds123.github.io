##### Abstract
We consider detection based on deep learning, and show it is possible to train detectors that perform well, without any knowledge of the underlying channel models. Moreover, when the channel model is known, we demonstrate that it is possible to train detectors that do not require channel state information (CSI). In particular, a technique we call sliding bidirectional recurrent neural network (SBRNN) is proposed for detection where, after training, the detector estimates the data in real-time as the signal stream arrives at the receiver. We evaluate this algorithm, as well as other neural network (NN) architectures, using the Poisson channel model, which is applicable to both optical and chemical communication systems. In addition, we also evaluate the performance of this detection method applied to data sent over a chemical communication platform, where the channel model is difficult to model analytically. We show that SBRNN is computationally efficient, and can perform detection under various channel conditions without knowing the underlying channel model. We also demonstrate that the bit error rate (BER) performance of the proposed SBRNN detector is better than that of a Viterbi detector with imperfect CSI as well as that of other NN detectors that have been previously proposed.

我们考虑基于深度学习的检测，并且表明可以在没有任何底层信道模型的情况下训练性能良好的检测器。而且，当信道模型已知时，我们证明可以训练不需要信道状态信息（CSI）的检测器。具体而言，提出了一种称为滑动双向递归神经网络（SBRNN）的技术，在训练之后，当信号流到达接收器时，检测器实时估计数据。我们评估这个算法，以及其他神经网络（NN）架构，使用泊松信道模型，这是适用于光学和化学通信系统。此外，我们还评估了这种检测方法的性能，该方法应用于通过化学通信平台发送的数据，其中信道模型难以进行分析建模。我们表明SBRNN在计算上是有效的，并且可以在不知道底层信道模型的情况下在各种信道条件下执行检测。我们还证明了所提出的SBRNN检测器的误码率（BER）性能优于具有不完善CSI的维特比检测器以及之前已经提出的其他NN检测器的误码率（BER）性能。
