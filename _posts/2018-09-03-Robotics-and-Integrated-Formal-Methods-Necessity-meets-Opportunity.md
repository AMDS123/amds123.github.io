##### Abstract
Robotic systems are multi-dimensional entities, combining both hardware and software, that are heavily dependent on, and influenced by, interactions with the real world. They can be variously categorised as embedded, cyberphysical, real-time, hybrid, adaptive and even autonomous systems, with a typical robotic system being likely to contain all of these aspects. The techniques for developing and verifying each of these system varieties are often quite distinct. This, together with the sheer complexity of robotic systems, leads us to argue that diverse formal techniques must be integrated in order to develop, verify, and provide certification evidence for, robotic systems. Furthermore, we propose the fast evolving field of robotics as an ideal catalyst for the advancement of integrated formal methods research, helping to drive the field in new and exciting directions and shedding light on the development of large-scale, dynamic, complex systems.

##### Abstract (translated by Google)
机器人系统是多维实体，结合了硬件和软件，它们严重依赖于与现实世界的交互并受其影响。它们可以被分类为嵌入式，网络物理，实时，混合，自适应甚至自治系统，典型的机器人系统可能包含所有这些方面。开发和验证这些系统中的每一种的技术通常非常不同。这与机器人系统的复杂性一起，使我们认为必须整合各种形式技术，以便为机器人系统开发，验证和提供认证证据。此外，我们提出快速发展的机器人技术领域，作为推进综合形式方法研究的理想催化剂，帮助推动新的和令人兴奋的方向领域，并揭示大规模，动态，复杂系统的发展。
