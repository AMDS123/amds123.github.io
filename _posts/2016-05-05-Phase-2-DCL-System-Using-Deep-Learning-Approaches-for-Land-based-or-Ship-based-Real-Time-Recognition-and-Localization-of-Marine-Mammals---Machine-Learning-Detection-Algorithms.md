##### Abstract
Overarching goals for this work aim to advance the state of the art for detection, classification and localization (DCL) in the field of bioacoustics. This goal is primarily achieved by building a generic framework for detection-classification (DC) using a fast, efficient and scalable architecture, demonstrating the capabilities of this system using on a variety of low-frequency mid-frequency cetacean sounds. Two primary goals are to develop transferable technologies for detection and classification in, one: the area of advanced algorithms, such as deep learning and other methods; and two: advanced systems, capable of real-time and archival processing. For each key area, we will focus on producing publications from this work and providing tools and software to the community where/when possible. Currently massive amounts of acoustic data are being collected by various institutions, corporations and national defense agencies. The long-term goal is to provide technical capability to analyze the data using automatic algorithms for (DC) based on machine intelligence. The goal of the automation is to provide effective and efficient mechanisms by which to process large acoustic datasets for understanding the bioacoustic behaviors of marine mammals. This capability will provide insights into the potential ecological impacts and influences of anthropogenic ocean sounds. This work focuses on building technologies using a maturity model based on DARPA 6.1 and 6.2 processes, for basic and applied research, respectively.

这项工作的总体目标旨在推动生物声学领域的检测，分类和定位（DCL）技术的发展。这个目标主要通过建立一个通用的检测分类框架（DC）来实现，该框架使用一个快速，高效和可扩展的架构，展示了这个系统使用各种低频中频鲸类动物的能力。两个主要目标是开发可转移的检测和分类技术，一个是深度学习和其他方法等高级算法领域;和两个：先进的系统，能够实时和档案处理。对于每个关键领域，我们将重点从这项工作中制作出版物，并在可能的情况下向社区提供工具和软件。目前，各种机构，企业和国防机构正在收集大量声学数据。长期目标是提供基于机器智能的（DC）自动算法分析数据的技术能力。自动化的目标是提供有效和高效的机制来处理大型声学数据集，以便了解海洋哺乳动物的生物声学行为。这种能力将提供人类海洋声音的潜在生态影响和影响的见解。这项工作的重点是利用基于DARPA 6.1和6.2过程的成熟度模型分别进行基础和应用研究。
