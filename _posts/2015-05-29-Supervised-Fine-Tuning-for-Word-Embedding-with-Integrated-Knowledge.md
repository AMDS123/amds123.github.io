##### Abstract
Learning vector representation for words is an important research field which may benefit many natural language processing tasks. Two limitations exist in nearly all available models, which are the bias caused by the context definition and the lack of knowledge utilization. They are difficult to tackle because these algorithms are essentially unsupervised learning approaches. Inspired by deep learning, the authors propose a supervised framework for learning vector representation of words to provide additional supervised fine tuning after unsupervised learning. The framework is knowledge rich approacher and compatible with any numerical vectors word representation. The authors perform both intrinsic evaluation like attributional and relational similarity prediction and extrinsic evaluations like the sentence completion and sentiment analysis. Experiments results on 6 embeddings and 4 tasks with 10 datasets show that the proposed fine tuning framework may significantly improve the quality of the vector representation of words.

学习单词的向量表示是一个重要的研究领域，可以使许多自然语言处理任务受益。几乎所有可用的模型都存在两个局限性，即由背景定义引起的偏见和缺乏知识利用。他们很难解决，因为这些算法本质上是无监督的学习方法。受深度学习的启发，作者提出了一个监督框架，用于学习单词的向量表示，以便在无监督学习之后提供额外的监督微调。该框架是知识丰富approacher和兼容任何数字向量的单词表示。作者进行归因和关系相似性预测等内在评价以及句子完成和情感分析等外在评价。对6个嵌入和4个10个数据任务的实验结果表明，所提出的微调框架可以显着提高词语向量表示的质量。
