##### Abstract
In this work, we jointly address the problem of text detection and recognition in natural scene images based on convolutional recurrent neural networks. We propose a unified network that simultaneously localizes and recognizes text with a single forward pass, avoiding intermediate processes like image cropping and feature re-calculation, word separation, or character grouping. In contrast to existing approaches that consider text detection and recognition as two distinct tasks and tackle them one by one, the proposed framework settles these two tasks concurrently. The whole framework can be trained end-to-end, requiring only images, the ground-truth bounding boxes and text labels. Through end-to-end training, the learned features can be more informative, which improves the overall performance. The convolutional features are calculated only once and shared by both detection and recognition, which saves processing time. Our proposed method has achieved competitive performance on several benchmark datasets.

在这项工作中，我们共同解决了基于卷积递归神经网络的自然场景图像中的文本检测和识别问题。我们提出了一个统一的网络，可以通过一个正向传递同时本地化和识别文本，避免了图像裁剪和特征重新计算，分词或字符分组等中间过程。与现有的将文本检测和识别视为两个不同的任务并逐一解决的方法相比，拟议的框架同时解决了这两个任务。整个框架可以被端对端地训练，只需要图像，地面真实包围盒和文本标签。通过端到端的培训，学到的功能可以提供更多的信息，从而提高整体性能。卷积特征只计算一次，并由检测和识别共享，这节省了处理时间。我们提出的方法已经在几个基准数据集上获得了竞争性的表现
