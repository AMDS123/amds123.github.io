##### Abstract
Recent, extremely successful methods in deep learning, such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have originated in machine learning for images. When applied to music signals and related music information retrieval (MIR) problems, researchers often apply standard FFT-based signal processing methods in order to create an image from the raw audio data. The impact of this basic signal processing step on the final outcome of the MIR task has not been widely studied and is not well understood. In this contribution, we study Gabor Scattering and a new representation, namely Mel Scattering. Furthermore, we suggest an alternative enhancement of the loss function that uses transformed representations of the output data to incorporate additional available information. We show how applying various different signal analysis methods can lead to useful invariances and improve the overall performance in MIR problems by reducing the amount of necessary training data or the necessity of augmentation.
