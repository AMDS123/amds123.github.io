##### Abstract
Optical see-through head-mounted displays (OST HMDs) are a major output medium for Augmented Reality, which have seen significant growth in popularity and usage among the general public due to the growing release of consumer-oriented models, such as the Microsoft Hololens. Unlike Virtual Reality headsets, OST HMDs inherently support the addition of computer-generated graphics directly into the light path between a user's eyes and their view of the physical world. As with most Augmented and Virtual Reality systems, the physical position of an OST HMD is typically determined by an external or embedded 6-Degree-of-Freedom tracking system. However, in order to properly render virtual objects, which are perceived as spatially aligned with the physical environment, it is also necessary to accurately measure the position of the user's eyes within the tracking system's coordinate frame. For over 20 years, researchers have proposed various calibration methods to determine this needed eye position. However, to date, there has not been a comprehensive overview of these procedures and their requirements. Hence, this paper surveys the field of calibration methods for OST HMDs. Specifically, it provides insights into the fundamentals of calibration techniques, and presents an overview of both manual and automatic approaches, as well as evaluation methods and metrics. Finally, it also identifies opportunities for future research. % relative to the tracking coordinate system, and, hence, its position in 3D space.

光学透视头戴式显示器（OST HMD）是增强现实的主要输出媒介，由于面向消费者的模型（诸如微软Hololens）的发布日益增长，已经在普通公众中显着增长的普及和使用。与虚拟现实耳机不同，OST头戴式耳机固有地支持将计算机生成的图形直接添加到用户的眼睛和他们对物理世界的视线之间的光路中。与大多数增强和虚拟现实系统一样，OST HMD的物理位置通常由外部或嵌入的6自由度跟踪系统确定。然而，为了适当地渲染被视为与物理环境在空间上对齐的虚拟对象，还需要在跟踪系统的坐标系内准确地测量用户眼睛的位置。 20多年来，研究人员提出了各种校准方法来确定所需的眼睛位置。但是，迄今为止，还没有对这些程序及其要求进行全面的概述。因此，本文对OST HMD的校准方法进行了研究。具体而言，它提供了对校准技术基础知识的深入了解，并概述了手动和自动方法，以及评估方法和指标。最后，它还为未来的研究提供了机会。相对于跟踪坐标系的％，以及因此它在3D空间中的位置。
