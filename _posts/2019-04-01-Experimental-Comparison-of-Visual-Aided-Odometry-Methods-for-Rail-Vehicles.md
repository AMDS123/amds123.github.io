##### Abstract
Today, rail vehicle localization is based on infrastructure-side Balises (beacons) together with on-board odometry to determine whether a rail segment is occupied. Such a coarse locking leads to a sub-optimal usage of the rail networks. New railway standards propose the use of moving blocks centered around the rail vehicles to increase the capacity of the network. However, this approach requires accurate and robust position and velocity estimation of all vehicles. In this work, we investigate the applicability, challenges and limitations of current visual and visual-inertial motion estimation frameworks for rail applications. An evaluation against RTK-GPS ground truth is performed on multiple datasets recorded in industrial, sub-urban, and forest environments. Our results show that stereo visual-inertial odometry has a great potential to provide a precise motion estimation because of its complementing sensor modalities and shows superior performance in challenging situations compared to other frameworks.
