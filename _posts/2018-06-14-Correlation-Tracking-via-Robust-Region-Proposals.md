##### Abstract
Recently, correlation filter-based trackers have received extensive attention due to their simplicity and superior speed. However, such trackers perform poorly when the target undergoes occlusion, viewpoint change or other challenging attributes due to pre-defined sampling strategy. To tackle these issues, in this paper, we propose an adaptive region proposal scheme to facilitate visual tracking. To be more specific, a novel tracking monitoring indicator is advocated to forecast tracking failure. Afterwards, we incorporate detection and scale proposals respectively, to recover from model drift as well as handle aspect ratio variation. We test the proposed algorithm on several challenging sequences, which have demonstrated that the proposed tracker performs favourably against state-of-the-art trackers.

最近，基于相关滤波器的跟踪器由于其简单和优越的速度而受到广泛的关注。然而，由于预定义的采样策略，当目标经历遮挡，视点改变或其他具有挑战性的属性时，这样的跟踪器表现不佳。为了解决这些问题，在本文中，我们提出了一种自适应区域提议方案来促进视觉跟踪。更具体地说，提倡一种新颖的跟踪监测指标来预测跟踪失败。之后，我们分别包含检测和缩放建议，从模型漂移中恢复以及处理宽高比变化。我们在几个具有挑战性的序列上测试了所提出的算法，这证明了所提出的跟踪器对于最先进的跟踪器有良好的性能。
