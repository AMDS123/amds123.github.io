##### Abstract
Pose estimation, tracking, and action recognition of articulated objects from depth images are important and challenging problems, which are normally considered separately. In this paper, a unified paradigm based on Lie group theory is proposed, which enables us to collectively address these related problems. Our approach is also applicable to a wide range of articulated objects. Empirically it is evaluated on lab animals including mouse and fish, as well as on human hand. On these applications, it is shown to deliver competitive results compared to the state-of-the-arts, and non-trivial baselines including convolutional neural networks and regression forest methods.

从深度图像的姿态估计，跟踪和动作识别的关节物体是重要和具有挑战性的问题，这通常是分开考虑的。本文提出了一个基于李群理论的统一范式，使我们能够共同解决这些相关问题。我们的方法也适用于范围广泛的铰接物体。经验上，它是评估实验动物，包括老鼠和鱼，以及在人的手上。在这些应用中，与现有技术和非平凡基线（包括卷积神经网络和回归森林方法）相比，它显示出提供有竞争力的结果。
