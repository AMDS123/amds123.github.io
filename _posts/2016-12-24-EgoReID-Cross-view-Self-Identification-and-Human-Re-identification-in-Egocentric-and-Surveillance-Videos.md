##### Abstract
Human identification remains to be one of the challenging tasks in computer vision community due to drastic changes in visual features across different viewpoints, lighting conditions, occlusion, etc. Most of the literature has been focused on exploring human re-identification across viewpoints that are not too drastically different in nature. Cameras usually capture oblique or side views of humans, leaving room for a lot of geometric and visual reasoning. Given the recent popularity of egocentric and top-view vision, re-identification across these two drastically different views can now be explored. Having an egocentric and a top view video, our goal is to identify the cameraman in the content of the top-view video, and also re-identify the people visible in the egocentric video, by matching them to the identities present in the top-view video. We propose a CRF-based method to address the two problems. Our experimental results demonstrates the efficiency of the proposed approach over a variety of video recorded from two views.

由于不同视点，光照条件，遮挡等视觉特征的剧烈变化，人类识别仍然是计算机视觉社区中具有挑战性的任务之一。大多数文献集中于探索人类重新识别性质上截然不同。相机通常会捕捉人类的倾斜或侧面视图，留下大量的几何和视觉推理空间。鉴于最近以自我为中心和顶尖视野的流行，现在可以探索这两种截然不同的观点的重新认同。有一个以自我为中心和顶视图的视频，我们的目标是在顶视图视频的内容中识别摄影师，并且通过将他们与在自上而下的视频中存在的身份匹配来重新识别在以自我为中心的视频中可见的人。观看视频。我们提出了一个基于CRF的方法来解决这两个问题。我们的实验结果证明了所提出的方法在从两个视图记录的各种视频上的效率。
