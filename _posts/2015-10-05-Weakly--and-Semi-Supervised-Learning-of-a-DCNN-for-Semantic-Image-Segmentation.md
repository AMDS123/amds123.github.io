##### Abstract
Deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs) trained on a large number of images with strong pixel-level annotations have recently significantly pushed the state-of-art in semantic image segmentation. We study the more challenging problem of learning DCNNs for semantic image segmentation from either (1) weakly annotated training data such as bounding boxes or image-level labels or (2) a combination of few strongly labeled and many weakly labeled images, sourced from one or multiple datasets. We develop Expectation-Maximization (EM) methods for semantic image segmentation model training under these weakly supervised and semi-supervised settings. Extensive experimental evaluation shows that the proposed techniques can learn models delivering competitive results on the challenging PASCAL VOC 2012 image segmentation benchmark, while requiring significantly less annotation effort. We share source code implementing the proposed system at this https URL

在具有强像素级注释的大量图像上训练的深卷积神经网络（DCNN）近来极大地推动了语义图像分割的最新技术。 （1）弱边界训练数据（如边界框或图像层次标签）或（2）少量强标记图像和许多弱标记图像的组合，这些图像源自一个或多个数据集。我们在这些弱监督和半监督设置下开发了用于语义图像分割模型训练的期望 - 最大化（EM）方法。广泛的实验评估表明，提出的技术可以学习模型提供具有挑战性的PASCAL VOC 2012图像分割基准的竞争结果，同时需要更少的注释工作量。我们在这个https URL上共享实现建议系统的源代码
