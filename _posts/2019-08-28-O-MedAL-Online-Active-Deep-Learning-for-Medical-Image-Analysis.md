##### Abstract
Active Learning methods create an optimized and labeled training set from unlabeled data. We introduce a novel Online Active Deep Learning method for Medical Image Analysis. We extend our MedAL active learning framework to present new results in this paper. Experiments on three medical image datasets show that our novel online active learning model requires significantly less labelings, is more accurate, and is more robust to class imbalances than existing methods. Our method is also more accurate and computationally efficient than the baseline model. Compared to random sampling and uncertainty sampling, the method uses 275 and 200 (out of 768) fewer labeled examples, respectively. For Diabetic Retinopathy detection, our method attains a 5.88% accuracy improvement over the baseline model when 80% of the dataset is labeled, and the model reaches baseline accuracy when only 40% is labeled.
