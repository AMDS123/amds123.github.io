##### Abstract
We measured the temperature dependence of photoluminescence involved with the metastability of unintentionally doped GaN. Reaction energy U of donor atom is 0.1eV and shallow donor is more stable than deep center. The impurity transition was applied to unintentionally doped GaN at low temperature and reaction energy U was provided for shallow-deep transition. We propose that the origin of DX center in unintentionally doped wurtize GaN is considered to be an oxygen impurity instead of silicon.
