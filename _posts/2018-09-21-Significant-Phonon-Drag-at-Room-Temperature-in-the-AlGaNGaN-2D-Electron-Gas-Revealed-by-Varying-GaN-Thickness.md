##### Abstract
In thermoelectric devices, the Seebeck coefficient is composed of a thermal diffusive component and a drag component, which arises from momentum exchange between charge carriers and lattice phonons. It is however hard to separate these components, which makes it challenging to understand whether drag is useful for thermoelectric power conversion. Here, we present the first study of the effect of phonon confinement on drag in the AlGaN/GaN two-dimensional electron gas by varying the underlying GaN layer thickness. We show that phonon drag does not contribute significantly to the thermoelectric performance in devices with a GaN thickness of ~100 nm, due to a suppression of the phonon mean free path. However, when the thickness is increased to ~1.2 {\mu}m, we uncover that 32% of the total Seebeck coefficient at room temperature can be attributed to the drag component. At 50 K, the drag component increases significantly to 88%. Further, by measuring the thermal conductivity in these AlGaN/GaN films, we show that the magnitude of the phonon drag can increase even when the thermal conductivity decreases. This decoupling of thermal conductivity and Seebeck coefficient could enable unprecedented advancements in thermoelectric power conversion.
