##### Abstract
In recent years, the increasing propagation of hate speech on social media and the urgent need for effective counter-measures have drawn significant investment from governments, companies, and empirical research. Despite a large number of emerging, scientific studies to address the problem, the performance of existing automated methods at identifying specific types of hate speech - as opposed to identifying non-hate -is still very unsatisfactory, and the reasons behind are poorly understood. This work undertakes the first in-depth analysis towards this problem and shows that, the very challenging nature of identifying hate speech on the social media is largely due to the extremely unbalanced presence of real hateful content in the typical datasets, and the lack of unique, discriminative features in such content, both causing them to reside in the 'long tail' of a dataset that is difficult to discover. To address this issue, we propose novel Deep Neural Network structures serving as effective feature extractors, and explore the usage of background information in the form of different word embeddings pre-trained from unlabelled corpora. We empirically evaluate our methods on the largest collection of hate speech datasets based on Twitter, and show that our methods can significantly outperform state of the art, as they are able to obtain a maximum improvement of between 4 and 16 percentage points (macro-average F1) depending on datasets.

近年来，仇恨言论在社交媒体上越来越多的传播以及迫切需要采取有效的对策已经引起了政府，公司和实证研究的重大投资。尽管有大量新兴的科学研究来解决这个问题，但是现有的自动化方法在识别特定类型的仇恨言论 - 而不是识别非仇恨 - 方面的表现仍然非常令人不满，并且背后的原因知之甚少。这项工作对这个问题进行了第一次深入的分析，结果表明，在社交媒体上发现仇恨言论非常具有挑战性，很大程度上是由于典型数据集中真实的仇恨内容非常不平衡，并且缺乏独特性，这些内容中的区别性特征，都导致它们驻留在难以发现的数据集的“长尾巴”中。为了解决这个问题，我们提出了作为有效特征提取器的新型深度神经网络结构，并探讨了以未标记语料库预先训练的不同词语嵌入形式的背景信息的使用。我们通过实证评估了我们基于Twitter的仇恨言语数据集的最大集合的方法，并且表明我们的方法可以显着地超越最新技术水平，因为他们能够获得4至16个百分点的最大改进（宏观平均值F1）取决于数据集。
