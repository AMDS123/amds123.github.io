##### Abstract
We provide a summary over architectural approaches that can be used to construct dependable learning-enabled autonomous systems, with a focus on automated driving. We consider three technology pillars for architecting dependable autonomy, namely diverse redundancy, information fusion, and runtime monitoring. For learning-enabled components, we additionally summarize recent architectural approaches to increase the dependability beyond standard convolutional neural networks. We conclude the study with a list of promising research directions addressing the challenges of existing approaches.
