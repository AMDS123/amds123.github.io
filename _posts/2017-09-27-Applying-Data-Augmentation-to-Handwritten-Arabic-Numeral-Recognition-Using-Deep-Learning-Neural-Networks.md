##### Abstract
Handwritten character recognition has been the center of research and a benchmark problem in the sector of pattern recognition and artificial intelligence, and it continues to be a challenging research topic. Due to its enormous application many works have been done in this field focusing on different languages. Arabic, being a diversified language has a huge scope of research with potential challenges. A convolutional neural network model for recognizing handwritten numerals in Arabic language is proposed in this paper, where the dataset is subject to various augmentation in order to add robustness needed for deep learning approach. The proposed method is empowered by the presence of dropout regularization to do away with the problem of data overfitting. Moreover, suitable change is introduced in activation function to overcome the problem of vanishing gradient. With these modifications, the proposed system achieves an accuracy of 99.4\% which performs better than every previous work on the dataset.

手写字符识别一直是研究的中心，也是模式识别和人工智能领域的一个基准问题，它仍然是一个具有挑战性的研究课题。由于其巨大的应用，在这个领域已经做了很多关于不同语言的作品。阿拉伯语是一种多元语言，它有着巨大的研究范围，有潜在的挑战。本文提出了一种用于识别阿拉伯语手写数字的卷积神经网络模型，其中为了增加深度学习方法所需的鲁棒性，对该数据集进行各种增强。所提出的方法通过丢失正则化的存在来消除数据过度拟合的问题。此外，在激活函数中引入适当的变化来克服渐消失的问题。通过这些修改，所提出的系统达到了99.4％的精确度，其性能比以前在数据集上的每个工作都要好。
