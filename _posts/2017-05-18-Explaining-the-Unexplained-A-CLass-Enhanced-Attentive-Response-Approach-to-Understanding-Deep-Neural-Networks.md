##### Abstract
In this work, we propose CLass-Enhanced Attentive Response (CLEAR): an approach to visualize and understand the decisions made by deep neural networks (DNNs) given a specific input. CLEAR facilitates the visualization of attentive regions and levels of interest of DNNs during the decision-making process. It also enables the visualization of the most dominant classes associated with these attentive regions of interest. As such, CLEAR can mitigate some of the shortcomings of heatmap-based methods associated with decision ambiguity, and allows for better insights into the decision-making process of DNNs. Quantitative and qualitative experiments across three different datasets demonstrate the efficacy of CLEAR for gaining a better understanding of the inner workings of DNNs during the decision-making process.

在这项工作中，我们提出了CLass增强的注意力反应（CLEAR）：一种方法可视化和理解深度神经网络（DNNs）给出的具体输入做出的决定。 CLEAR有助于在决策过程中对DNN的注意力区域和兴趣水平进行可视化。它还使得与这些关注的感兴趣区域相关的最显着的类别的可视化成为可能。因此，CLEAR可以减轻与决策歧义有关的基于热图的方法的一些缺点，并且可以更好地洞察DNN的决策过程。通过三个不同数据集的定量和定性实验证明了CLEAR在决策过程中更好地理解DNN的内部工作的有效性。
