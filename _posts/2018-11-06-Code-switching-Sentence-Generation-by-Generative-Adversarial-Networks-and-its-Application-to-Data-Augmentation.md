##### Abstract
Code-switching is about dealing with alternative languages in speech or text. It is partially speaker-depend and domain-related, so completely explaining the phenomenon by linguistic rules is challenging. Compared to monolingual tasks, insufficient data is an issue for code-switching. To mitigate the issue without expensive human annotation, we proposed an unsupervised method for code-switching data augmentation. By utilizing a generative adversarial network, we can generate intra-sentential code-switching sentences from monolingual sentences. We applied proposed method on two corpora, and the result shows that the generated code-switching sentences improve the performance of code-switching language models.
