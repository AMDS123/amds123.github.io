##### Abstract
In computer vision, the estimation of the fundamental matrix is a basic problem that has been extensively studied. The accuracy of the estimation imposes a significant influence on subsequent tasks such as the camera trajectory determination and 3D reconstruction. In this paper we propose a new method for fundamental matrix estimation that makes use of clustering a group of 4D vectors. The key insight is the observation that among the 4D vectors constructed from matching pairs of points obtained from the SIFT algorithm, well-defined cluster points tend to be reliable inliers suitable for fundamental matrix estimation. Based on this, we utilizes a recently proposed efficient clustering method through density peaks seeking and propose a new clustering assisted method. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm is faster and more accurate than currently commonly used methods.

在计算机视觉中，基本矩阵的估计是一个已经被广泛研究的基本问题。估计的准确性对随后的任务（诸如相机轨迹确定和3D重建）产生重大影响。在本文中，我们提出了一种新的基本矩阵估计方法，利用聚类的一组4D向量。关键的洞察是观察到在从SIFT算法获得的匹配对的点构建的4D向量中，明确定义的聚类点倾向于是适合于基础矩阵估计的可靠内点。在此基础上，利用最近提出的通过密度峰值搜索的有效聚类方法，提出了一种新的聚类辅助方法。实验结果表明，该算法比目前常用的方法更快，更准确。
