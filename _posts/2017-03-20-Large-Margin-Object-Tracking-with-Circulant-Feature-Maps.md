##### Abstract
Structured output support vector machine (SVM) based tracking algorithms have shown favorable performance recently. Nonetheless, the time-consuming candidate sampling and complex optimization limit their real-time applications. In this paper, we propose a novel large margin object tracking method which absorbs the strong discriminative ability from structured output SVM and speeds up by the correlation filter algorithm significantly. Secondly, a multimodal target detection technique is proposed to improve the target localization precision and prevent model drift introduced by similar objects or background noise. Thirdly, we exploit the feedback from high-confidence tracking results to avoid the model corruption problem. We implement two versions of the proposed tracker with the representations from both conventional hand-crafted and deep convolution neural networks (CNNs) based features to validate the strong compatibility of the algorithm. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed tracker performs superiorly against several state-of-the-art algorithms on the challenging benchmark sequences while runs at speed in excess of 80 frames per second. The source code and experimental results will be made publicly available.

基于结构化输出支持向量机（SVM）的跟踪算法近来表现出良好的性能。尽管如此，耗时的候选抽样和复杂优化限制了他们的实时应用。本文提出了一种新颖的大边缘目标跟踪方法，该方法从结构化输出支持向量机中吸收强的判别能力，并通过相关滤波算法显着加速。其次，提出了一种多模态目标检测技术，以提高目标定位精度，防止类似目标或背景噪声引起的模型漂移。第三，我们利用高置信度跟踪结果的反馈来避免模型腐败问题。我们实现了两个版本的跟踪器的代表来自传统的手工制作和深度卷积神经网络（CNNs）基于特征来验证算法的强大的兼容性。实验结果证明，所提出的跟踪器在具有挑战性的基准序列上运行速度超过每秒80帧的情况下优于几种最先进的算法。源代码和实验结果将公开发布。
