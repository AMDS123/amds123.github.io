##### Abstract
The increasing popularity of animes makes it vulnerable to unwanted usages like copyright violations and pornography. That is why, we need to develop a method to detect and recognize animation characters. Skin detection is one of the most important steps in this way. Though there are some methods to detect human skin color, but those methods do not work properly for anime characters. Anime skin varies greatly from human skin in color, texture, tone and in different kinds of lighting. They also vary greatly among themselves. Moreover, many other things (for example leather, shirt, hair etc.), which are not skin, can have color similar to skin. In this paper, we have proposed three methods that can identify an anime character skin more successfully as compared with Kovac, Swift, Saleh and Osman methods, which are primarily designed for human skin detection. Our methods are based on RGB values and their comparative relations.

动画越来越受欢迎使得它容易受到不当使用，如侵犯版权和色情。这就是为什么我们需要开发一种检测和识别动画角色的方法。皮肤检测是这种方式中最重要的步骤之一。虽然有一些方法来检测人的肤色，但是这些方法对于动画人物来说是不能正常工作的。动漫皮肤在颜色，质地，色调和不同种类的照明中与人的皮肤差别很大。他们之间也有很大的不同。而且，很多不是皮肤的东西（例如皮革，衬衫，头发等）可以具有与皮肤类似的颜色。与Kovac，Swift，Saleh和Osman方法相比，本文提出了三种可以更好地识别动画人物皮肤的方法，这些方法主要是为人体皮肤检测而设计的。我们的方法基于RGB值及其比较关系。
