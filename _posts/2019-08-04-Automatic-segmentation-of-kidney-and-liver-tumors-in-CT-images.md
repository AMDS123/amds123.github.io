##### Abstract
Automatic segmentation of hepatic lesions in computed tomography (CT) images is a challenging task to perform due to heterogeneous, diffusive shape of tumors and complex background. To address the problem more and more researchers rely on assistance of deep convolutional neural networks (CNN) with 2D or 3D type architecture that have proven to be effective in a wide range of computer vision tasks, including medical image processing. In this technical report, we carry out research focused on more careful approach to the process of learning rather than on complex architecture of the CNN. We have chosen MICCAI 2017 LiTS dataset for training process and the public 3DIRCADb dataset for validation of our method. The proposed algorithm reached DICE score 78.8% on the 3DIRCADb dataset. The described method was then applied to the 2019 Kidney Tumor Segmentation (KiTS-2019) challenge, where our single submission achieved 96.38% for kidney and 67.38% for tumor Dice scores.
