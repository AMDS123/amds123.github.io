##### Abstract
Pan-sharpening is a fundamental and significant task in the field of remote sensing imagery processing, in which high-resolution spatial details from panchromatic images are employed to enhance the spatial resolution of multi-spectral (MS) images. As the transformation from low spatial resolution MS image to high-resolution MS image is complex and highly non-linear, inspired by the powerful representation for non-linear relationships of deep neural networks, we introduce multi-scale feature extraction and residual learning into the basic convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture and propose the multi-scale and multi-depth convolutional neural network (MSDCNN) for the pan-sharpening of remote sensing imagery. Both the quantitative assessment results and the visual assessment confirm that the proposed network yields high-resolution MS images that are superior to the images produced by the compared state-of-the-art methods.

泛锐化是遥感影像处理领域的一项基础性重大任务，利用全色影像的高分辨率空间细节来提高多光谱影像的空间分辨率。由于从低空间分辨率MS图像到高分辨率MS图像的转换非常复杂且高度非线性，受深度神经网络非线性关系的强大表示的启发，我们引入了多尺度特征提取和残差学习基本卷积神经网络（CNN）体系结构，提出了多尺度多深度卷积神经网络（MSDCNN），用于遥感影像的泛锐化。定量评估结果和视觉评估均证实，所提出的网络产生的高分辨率MS图像优于由比较的最先进的方法产生的图像。
