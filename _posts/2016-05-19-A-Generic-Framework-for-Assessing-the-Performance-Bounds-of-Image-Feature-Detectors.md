##### Abstract
Since local feature detection has been one of the most active research areas in computer vision during the last decade, a large number of detectors have been proposed. The interest in feature-based applications continues to grow and has thus rendered the task of characterizing the performance of various feature detection methods an important issue in vision research. Inspired by the good practices of electronic system design, a generic framework based on the repeatability measure is presented in this paper that allows assessment of the upper and lower bounds of detector performance and finds statistically significant performance differences between detectors as a function of image transformation amount by introducing a new variant of McNemars test in an effort to design more reliable and effective vision systems. The proposed framework is then employed to establish operating and guarantee regions for several state-of-the-art detectors and to identify their statistical performance differences for three specific image transformations: JPEG compression, uniform light changes and blurring. The results are obtained using a newly acquired, large image database (20482) images with 539 different scenes. These results provide new insights into the behaviour of detectors and are also useful from the vision systems design perspective.

由于局部特征检测一直是计算机视觉在过去十年中最活跃的研究领域之一，因此提出了大量的检测器。对基于特征的应用程序的兴趣不断增长，从而使得表征各种特征检测方法的性能成为视觉研究中的一个重要问题。受到电子系统设计良好实践的启发，本文提出了一种基于可重复性测量的通用框架，该框架允许评估检测器性能的上限和下限，并根据图像变换量发现检测器之间统计学上显着的性能差异通过引入McNemars测试的新变种来设计更可靠和有效的视觉系统。所提出的框架然后被用来建立几个最先进的探测器的操作和保证区域，并确定它们的统计性能差异的三个特定的图像转换：JPEG压缩，均匀的光线变化和模糊。使用新获得的具有539个不同场景的大图像数据库（20482）图像获得结果。这些结果为探测器的行为提供了新的见解，并且从视觉系统设计的角度来看也是有用的。
