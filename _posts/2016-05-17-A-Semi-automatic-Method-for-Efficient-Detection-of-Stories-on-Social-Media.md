##### Abstract
Twitter has become one of the main sources of news for many people. As real-world events and emergencies unfold, Twitter is abuzz with hundreds of thousands of stories about the events. Some of these stories are harmless, while others could potentially be life-saving or sources of malicious rumors. Thus, it is critically important to be able to efficiently track stories that spread on Twitter during these events. In this paper, we present a novel semi-automatic tool that enables users to efficiently identify and track stories about real-world events on Twitter. We ran a user study with 25 participants, demonstrating that compared to more conventional methods, our tool can increase the speed and the accuracy with which users can track stories about real-world events.

##### Abstract (translated by Google)
Twitter已成为许多人的主要消息来源之一。随着真实世界的事件和紧急情况的发生，Twitter正在冒出数以十万计的事件故事。其中一些故事是无害的，而另一些故事可能是拯救生命或恶意谣言的来源。因此，能够有效地跟踪在这些事件期间在Twitter上传播的故事至关重要。在本文中，我们提出了一种新的半自动工具，使用户能够在Twitter上高效地识别和追踪真实事件的故事。我们用25名参与者进行了一项用户研究，表明与传统方法相比，我们的工具可以提高用户追踪真实事件故事的速度和准确性。
