##### Abstract
We create and release the first publicly available commercial customer service corpus with annotated relational segments. Human-computer data from three live customer service Intelligent Virtual Agents (IVAs) in the domains of travel and telecommunications were collected, and reviewers marked all text that was deemed unnecessary to the determination of user intention. After merging the selections of multiple reviewers to create highlighted texts, a second round of annotation was done to determine the classes of language present in the highlighted sections such as the presence of Greetings, Backstory, Justification, Gratitude, Rants, or Emotions. This resulting corpus is a valuable resource for improving the quality and relational abilities of IVAs. As well as discussing the corpus itself, we compare the usage of such language in human-human interactions on TripAdvisor forums. We show that removal of this language from task-based inputs has a positive effect on IVA understanding by both an increase in confidence and improvement in responses, demonstrating the need for automated methods of its discovery.

我们创建并发布了具有注释关系段的第一个公开可用的商业客户服务语料库。收集来自旅游和电信领域中的三个现场客户服务智能虚拟代理（IVA）的人机数据，并且评论者标记对确定用户意图不需要的所有文本。合并多个评论者的选择以创建突出显示的文本之后，进行第二轮注释以确定突出显示的部分中存在的语言类别，例如问候，背景，理由，感激，咆哮或情绪的存在。这个结果语料库是提高IVA质量和关系能力的宝贵资源。除了讨论语料库本身，我们还比较了Tr​​ipAdvisor论坛上这种语言在人际交往中的用法。我们表明，从基于任务的输入中去除这种语言对IVA的理解有积极的作用，既增加了信心，又提高了反应，表明需要自动发现的方法。
