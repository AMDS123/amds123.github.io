##### Abstract
Deep learning has been shown to outperform traditional machine learning algorithms across a wide range of problem domains. However, current deep learning algorithms have been criticized as uninterpretable "black-boxes" which cannot explain their decision making processes. This is a major shortcoming that prevents the widespread application of deep learning to domains with regulatory processes such as finance. As such, industries such as finance have to rely on traditional models like decision trees that are much more interpretable but less effective than deep learning for complex problems. In this paper, we propose CLEAR-Trade, a novel financial AI visualization framework for deep learning-driven stock market prediction that mitigates the interpretability issue of deep learning methods. In particular, CLEAR-Trade provides a effective way to visualize and explain decisions made by deep stock market prediction models. We show the efficacy of CLEAR-Trade in enhancing the interpretability of stock market prediction by conducting experiments based on S&P 500 stock index prediction. The results demonstrate that CLEAR-Trade can provide significant insight into the decision-making process of deep learning-driven financial models, particularly for regulatory processes, thus improving their potential uptake in the financial industry.

已经证明，深度学习在广泛的问题领域中优于传统的机器学习算法。然而，目前的深度学习算法被批评为无法解释其决策过程的“黑盒子”。这是一个主要的缺陷，阻止深度学习在金融等监管流程领域广泛应用。因此，像金融这样的行业不得不依赖像决策树这样的传统模型，这些模型比复杂问题的深度学习更加可以解释，但是效果却不那么明显。在本文中，我们提出了CLEAR-Tr​​ade，一种用于深度学习驱动的股票市场预测的新型金融AI可视化框架，它可以减轻深度学习方法的可解释性问题。特别是，CLEAR-Tr​​ade提供了一种有效的方式来可视化和解释深度股市预测模型所做的决定。我们通过基于标普500指数预测的实验来展示CLEAR-Tr​​ade在提高股市预测的可解释性方面的有效性。结果表明，CLEAR-Tr​​ade可以深入洞察深度学习驱动型金融模型的决策过程，尤其是监管过程，从而提高其在金融行业的潜力。
