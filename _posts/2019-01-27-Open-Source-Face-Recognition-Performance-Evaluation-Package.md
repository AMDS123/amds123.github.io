##### Abstract
Biometrics-related research has been accelerated significantly by deep learning technology. However, there are limited open-source resources to help researchers evaluate their deep learning-based biometrics algorithms efficiently, especially for the face recognition tasks. In this work, we design and implement a light-weight, maintainable, scalable, generalizable, and extendable face recognition evaluation toolbox named FaRE that supports both online and offline evaluation to provide feedback to algorithm development and accelerate biometrics-related research. FaRE consists of a set of evaluation metric functions and provides various APIs for commonly-used face recognition datasets including LFW, CFP, UHDB31, and IJB-series datasets, which can be easily extended to include other customized datasets. The package and the pre-trained baseline models will be released for public academic research use after obtaining university approval.
