##### Abstract
It is extremely important to correctly identify the cultivars of maize seeds in the breeding process of maize. In this paper, the transfer learning as a method of deep learning is adopted to establish a model by combining with the hyperspectral imaging technology. The haploid seeds can be recognized from large amount of diploid maize ones with great accuracy through the model. First, the information of maize seeds on each wave band is collected using the hyperspectral imaging technology, and then the recognition model is built on VGG-19 network, which is pre-trained by large-scale computer vision database (Image-Net). The correct identification rate of model utilizing seed spectral images containing 256 wave bands (862.5-1704.2nm) reaches 96.32%, and the correct identification rate of the model utilizing the seed spectral images containing single-band reaches 95.75%. The experimental results show that, CNN model which is pre-trained by visible light image database can be applied to the near-infrared hyperspectral imaging-based identification of maize seeds, and high accurate identification rate can be achieved. Meanwhile, when there is small amount of data samples, it can still realize high recognition by using transfer learning. The model not only meets the requirements of breeding recognition, but also greatly reduce the cost occurred in sample collection.

在玉米育种过程中正确鉴定玉米种子品种极为重要。本文采用转移学习作为深度学习的方法，结合高光谱成像技术建立模型。通过该模型，可以从大量的二倍体玉米中准确地识别单倍体种子。首先利用高光谱成像技术采集每个波段玉米种子的信息，然后在大规模计算机视觉数据库（Image-Net）预先训练的VGG-19网络上建立识别模型。利用256波段（862.5-1704.2nm）种子光谱图像的模型识别正确率达到96.32％，利用含单波段种子光谱图像的模型正确识别率达到95.75％。实验结果表明，基于可见光图像库预训练的CNN模型可应用于玉米种子的近红外高光谱成像识别，可实现高精度的识别率。同时，当数据样本量较小时，仍然可以通过使用转移学习实现高识别。该模型不仅满足了育种识别的要求，而且大大降低了样品采集成本。
