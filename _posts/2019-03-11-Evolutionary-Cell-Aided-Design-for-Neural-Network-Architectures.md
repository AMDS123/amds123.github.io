##### Abstract
Mathematical theory shows us that multilayer feedforward Artificial Neural Networks(ANNs) are universal function approximators, capable of approximating any measurable function to any desired degree of accuracy. In practice designing practical and efficient neural network architectures require significant effort and expertise. We present a new software framework called Evolutionary Cell Aided Design(ECAD) meant to aid in the exploration and design of Neural Network Architectures(NNAs) for reconfigurable hardware. The framework uses evolutionary algorithms to search for efficient hardware architectures. Given a general structure, a set of constraints and fitness functions, the framework will explore the space of hardware solutions and attempt to find the fittest solutions.
