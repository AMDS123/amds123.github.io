##### Abstract
Classifying large scale networks into several categories and distinguishing them according to their fine structures is of great importance with several applications in real life. However, most studies of complex networks focus on properties of a single network but seldom on classification, clustering, and comparison between different networks, in which the network is treated as a whole. Due to the non-Euclidean properties of the data, conventional methods can hardly be applied on networks directly. In this paper, we propose a novel framework of complex network classifier (CNC) by integrating network embedding and convolutional neural network to tackle the problem of network classification. By training the classifiers on synthetic complex network data and real international trade network data, we show CNC can not only classify networks in a high accuracy and robustness, it can also extract the features of the networks automatically.

将大规模网络分为几类，并根据其精细结构进行区分，对于现实生活中的几种应用具有重要意义。然而，大多数复杂网络的研究都集中在单一网络的属性上，而很少对不同网络进行分类，聚类和比较，网络被视为一个整体。由于数据的非欧几里得性质，传统的方法很难直接应用于网络。在本文中，我们通过集成网络嵌入和卷积神经网络来解决网络分类问题，提出了一种新的复杂网络分类器（CNC）框架。通过对综合复杂网络数据和真实国际贸易网络数据进行分类器训练，表明数控网络不仅能够对网络进行高精度，高鲁棒性的分类，而且能够自动提取网络的特征。
