##### Abstract
This article presents an approximation algorithm for a task allocation, sequencing and scheduling problem involving a team of human operators and robots. Specifically, we present an algorithm with an approximation ratio as a function of the number of human operators ($m$) and the number of robots ($k$) in the team. The approximation ratios are $\frac{7}{2} -\frac{5}{4k}$, $\frac{5}{2} -\frac{1}{k}$ and $\frac{7}{2} -\frac{1}{k}$ when $m=1$, $m\geq k\geq 2$ and $k&gt;m\geq 2$ respectively.
