##### Abstract
There has been significant progresses for image object detection in recent years. Nevertheless, video object detection has received little attention, although it is more challenging and more important in practical scenarios. Built upon the recent works, this work proposes a unified approach based on the principle of multi-frame end-to-end learning of features and cross-frame motion. Our approach extends prior works with three new techniques and steadily pushes forward the performance envelope (speed-accuracy tradeoff), towards high performance video object detection.

近年来图像目标检测取得了重大进展。尽管如此，视频对象检测却很少受到关注，尽管在实际情况下它更具挑战性和重要性。本文在最近的工作基础上，提出了一种基于多帧端到端特征学习和跨帧运动的统一方法。我们的方法使用三种新技术扩展了先前的工作，并稳步推进性能包络（速度 - 精度折衷），朝着高性能视频对象检测。
