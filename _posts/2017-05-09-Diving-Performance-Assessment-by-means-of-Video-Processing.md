##### Abstract
The aim of this paper is to present a procedure for video analysis applied in an innovative way to diving performance assessment. Sport performance analysis is a trend that is growing exponentially for all level athletes. The technique here shown is based on two important requirements: flexibility and low cost. These two requirements lead to many problems in the video processing that have been faced and solved in this paper.
