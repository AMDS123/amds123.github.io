##### Abstract
This paper considers the problem of information capacity of a random neural network. The network is represented by matrices that are square and symmetrical. The matrices have a weight which determines the highest and lowest possible value found in the matrix. The examined matrices are randomly generated and analyzed by a computer program. We find the surprising result that the capacity of the network is a maximum for the binary random neural network and it does not change as the number of quantization levels associated with the weights increases.
