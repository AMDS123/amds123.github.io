##### Abstract
In this paper, we propose a framework that enables a human teacher to shape a robot behaviour by interactively providing it with unlabeled instructions. We ground the meaning of instruction signals in the task learning process, and use them simultaneously for guiding the latter. We implement our framework as a modular architecture, named TICS (Task-Instruction-Contingency-Shaping) that combines different information sources: a predefined reward function, human evaluative feedback and unlabeled instructions. This approach provides a novel perspective for robotic task learning that lies between Reinforcement Learning and Supervised Learning paradigms. We evaluate our framework both in simulation and with a real robot. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework in accelerating the task learning process and in reducing the amount of required teaching signals.
