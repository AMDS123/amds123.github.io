##### Abstract
This work adopts the notion of Ceteris Paribus (CP) as an interpretation of the Decision Maker (DM) preferences and incorporates it in a constrained multiobjective problem known as virtual machine placement (VMP). VMP is an essential multiobjective problem in the design and operation of cloud data centers concerned about placing each virtual machine to a physical machine (a server) in the data center. We analyze the effectiveness of CP interpretation on VMP problems and propose an NSGA-II variant with which preferred solutions are returned at almost no extra time cost.
