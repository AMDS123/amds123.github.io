##### Abstract
Automated planning is a major topic of research in artificial intelligence, and enjoys a long and distinguished history. The classical paradigm assumes a distinguished initial state, comprised of a set of facts, and is defined over a set of actions which change that state in one way or another. Planning in many real-world settings, however, is much more involved: an agent's knowledge is almost never simply a set of facts that are true, and actions that the agent intends to execute never operate the way they are supposed to. Thus, probabilistic planning attempts to incorporate stochastic models directly into the planning process. In this article, we briefly report on probabilistic planning through the lens of probabilistic programming: a programming paradigm that aims to ease the specification of structured probability distributions. In particular, we provide an overview of the features of two systems, HYPE and ALLEGRO, which emphasise different strengths of probabilistic programming that are particularly useful for complex modelling issues raised in probabilistic planning. Among other things, with these systems, one can instantiate planning problems with growing and shrinking state spaces, discrete and continuous probability distributions, and non-unique prior distributions in a first-order setting.

自动化规划是人工智能研究的一个重要课题，历史悠久，历史悠久。古典范式假设一个杰出的初始状态，由一组事实组成，并且定义在一系列改变该状态的行动上。然而，在许多现实环境中进行规划涉及更多：代理人的知识几乎不是简单的一组事实，事实上这些代理人意图执行的行为决不会按照他们应有的方式运作。因此，概率规划试图将随机模型直接纳入规划过程。在这篇文章中，我们通过概率规划的镜头简要地报告了概率规划：一个旨在简化结构化概率分布规范的编程范例。特别是，我们概述了两个系统的特点，即HYPE和ALLEGRO，强调了概率规划的不同优势，对于概率规划中提出的复杂建模问题特别有用。除此之外，利用这些系统，可以实例化具有增长和缩小状态空间的计划问题，离散和连续的概率分布，以及在一阶设置中的非唯一先验分布。
