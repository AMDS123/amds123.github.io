##### Abstract
Self-heating is a severe problem for high-power GaN electronic and optoelectronic devices. Various thermal management solutions, e.g. flip-chip bonding or composite substrates have been attempted. However, temperature rise still limits applications of the nitride-based technology. Here we demonstrate that thermal management of GaN transistors can be substantially improved via introduction of the alternative heat-escaping channels implemented with few-layer graphene - an excellent heat conductor. We have transferred few-layer graphene to AlGaN/GaN heterostructure field-effect transistors on SiC substrates to form the "graphene-graphite quilts" - lateral heat spreaders, which remove heat from the channel regions. Using the micro-Raman spectroscopy for in-situ monitoring we have shown that temperature can be lowered by as much as ~ 20oC in such devices operating at ~13-W/mm power density. The simulations suggest that the efficiency of the "graphene quilts" can be made even higher in GaN devices on thermally resistive sapphire substrates and in the designs with the closely located heat sinks. Our results open a novel application niche for few-layer graphene in high-power electronics.

对于高功率GaN电子和光电子器件来说，自热是一个严重的问题。各种热管理解决方案，例如已经尝试了倒装芯片结合或复合衬底。但是，温度上升仍然限制了氮化物技术的应用。在这里，我们展示了GaN晶体管的热管理可以通过引入用少层石墨烯（一种优良的热导体）实现的替代散热通道而大大改善。我们将少量石墨烯转移到SiC衬底上的AlGaN / GaN异质结场效应晶体管，形成“石墨烯 - 石墨被子” - 侧向散热器，从沟道区域去除热量。使用微拉曼光谱进行原位监测，我们发现，在功率密度约为13 W / mm的器件中，温度可以降低约20oC。模拟结果表明，石墨烯棉被的效率可以在耐热蓝宝石衬底上的GaN器件和具有紧密定位的散热片的设计中变得更高。我们的结果为高功率电子产品中的少量石墨烯开辟了新的应用领域。
