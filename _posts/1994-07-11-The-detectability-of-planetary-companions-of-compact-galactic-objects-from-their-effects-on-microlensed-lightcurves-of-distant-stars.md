##### Abstract
We discuss a possible method for detection of dark companions of galactic objects of stellar mass. Such binary systems are likely to occur in the galactic disk and possibly also in the halo. The high incidence of binary and higher-multiplicity systems in the solar neighborhood, if indicative of the galactic disk at large, implies that current searches for the gravitational microlensing signature of massive compact objects in our galaxy would yield a significant fraction of binary systems. Our calculations suggest that 40% of the lightcurves that will be obtained in such searches may be sufficiently perturbed to reveal, if sufficiently well-sampled, the presence of a compact dark companion of Jovian mass orbiting a primary. The likelihood of occurrence of perturbed lightcurves must also be taken into account by systematic search programs, to improve their event detection efficiency. The statistics of perturbed lensing events, if carefully interpreted, could yield estimates of the incidence of binary systems with low mass ratios, including that of systems with planets.

我们讨论一种探测恒星质量星系物体黑暗同伴的可能方法。这样的二元体系很可能发生在银盘上，也可能发生在光环中。如果指示银河系盘面，太阳附近的二元和更高多重系统的高发生意味着目前搜索银河系中大量致密物体的重力微透镜标记将产生大部分二元系统。我们的计算表明，在这样的搜索中将获得的40％的光曲线可能被充分扰动，以显示如果充分采样良好，则出现紧凑的黑色伴随着木星质量绕轨道运行的初级。系统搜索程序也必须考虑到扰动光线发生的可能性，以提高事件检测效率。扰动的透镜事件的统计，如果仔细解释，可以产生低质量比的二元系统，包括行星系统的发生率估计。
