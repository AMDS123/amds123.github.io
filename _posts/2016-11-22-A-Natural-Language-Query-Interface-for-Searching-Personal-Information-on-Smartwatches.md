##### Abstract
Currently, personal assistant systems, run on smartphones and use natural language interfaces. However, these systems rely mostly on the web for finding information. Mobile and wearable devices can collect an enormous amount of contextual personal data such as sleep and physical activities. These information objects and their applications are known as quantified-self, mobile health or personal informatics, and they can be used to provide a deeper insight into our behavior. To our knowledge, existing personal assistant systems do not support all types of quantified-self queries. In response to this, we have undertaken a user study to analyze a set of "textual questions/queries" that users have used to search their quantified-self or mobile health data. Through analyzing these questions, we have constructed a light-weight natural language based query interface, including a text parser algorithm and a user interface, to process the users' queries that have been used for searching quantified-self information. This query interface has been designed to operate on small devices, i.e. smartwatches, as well as augmenting the personal assistant systems by allowing them to process end users' natural language queries about their quantified-self data.

目前，个人助理系统在智能手机上运行，​​并使用自然语言界面。但是，这些系统主要依靠网络来查找信息。移动和可穿戴设备可以收集大量的上下文个人数据，例如睡眠和身体活动。这些信息对象及其应用被称为量化自我，移动健康或个人信息学，它们可以用来更深入地了解我们的行为。据我们所知，现有的个人助理系统不支持所有类型的量化自查询。为此，我们开展了一项用户研究，分析用户用于搜索量化自我或移动健康数据的一系列“文本问题/疑问”。通过对这些问题的分析，我们构建了一个轻量级的自然语言查询接口，包括文本解析器算法和用户界面，处理用户查询量化自我信息的查询。该查询接口被设计为在小型设备（即智能手表）上操作，并且通过允许他们处理最终用户对其量化的自身数据的自然语言查询来增强个人助理系统。
