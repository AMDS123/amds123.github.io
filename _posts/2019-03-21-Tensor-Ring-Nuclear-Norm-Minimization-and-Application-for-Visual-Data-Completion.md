##### Abstract
Tensor ring (TR) decomposition has been successfully used to obtain the state-of-the-art performance in the visual data completion problem. However, the existing TR-based completion methods are severely non-convex and computationally demanding. In addition, the determination of the optimal TR rank is a tough work in practice. To overcome these drawbacks, we first introduce a class of new tensor nuclear norms by using tensor circular unfolding. Then we theoretically establish connection between the rank of the circularly-unfolded matrices and the TR ranks. We also develop an efficient tensor completion algorithm by minimizing the proposed tensor nuclear norm. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our proposed tensor completion method outperforms the conventional tensor completion methods in the image/video in-painting problem with striped missing values.
