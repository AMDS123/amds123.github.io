##### Abstract
Opinion mining refers to the use of natural language processing, text analysis and computational linguistics to identify and extract subjective information in textual material. Opinion mining, also known as sentiment analysis, has received a lot of attention in recent times, as it provides a number of tools to analyse the public opinion on a number of different topics. Comparative opinion mining is a subfield of opinion mining that deals with identifying and extracting information that is expressed in a comparative form (e.g.~"paper X is better than the Y"). Comparative opinion mining plays a very important role when ones tries to evaluate something, as it provides a reference point for the comparison. This paper provides a review of the area of comparative opinion mining. It is the first review that cover specifically this topic as all previous reviews dealt mostly with general opinion mining. This survey covers comparative opinion mining from two different angles. One from perspective of techniques and the other from perspective of comparative opinion elements. It also incorporates preprocessing tools as well as dataset that were used by the past researchers that can be useful to the future researchers in the field of comparative opinion mining.

##### Abstract (translated by Google)
意见挖掘是指利用自然语言处理，文本分析和计算语言学来识别和提取文本材料中的主观信息。意见挖掘也被称为情感分析，近来受到了很多关注，因为它提供了许多工具来分析关于多个不同主题的公众舆论。比较意见挖掘是意见挖掘的一个子领域，涉及识别和提取以比较形式表达的信息（例如“论文X比Y好”）。比较意见挖掘在评估某些事物时起着非常重要的作用，因为它提供了一个比较的参考点。本文提供了对比较意见挖掘领域的回顾。这是第一个专门涉及这个话题的评论，因为之前所有的评论主要涉及到一般意见挖掘。本次调查涵盖了两个不同角度的比较意见挖掘。一个是从技术的角度来看，另一个是从比较舆论的角度来看。它还包含预处理工具以及过去研究人员使用的数据集，这些数据集可用于比较意见挖掘领域的未来研究人员。
