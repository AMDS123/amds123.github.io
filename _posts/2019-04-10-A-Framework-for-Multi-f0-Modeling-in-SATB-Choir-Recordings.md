##### Abstract
Fundamental frequency (f0) modeling is an important but relatively unexplored aspect of choir singing. Performance evaluation as well as auditory analysis of singing, whether individually or in a choir, often depend on extracting f0 contours for the singing voice. However, due to the large number of singers, singing at a similar frequency range, extracting the exact individual pitch contours from choir recordings is a challenging task. In this paper, we address this task and develop a methodology for modeling pitch contours of SATB choir recordings. A typical SATB choir consists of four parts, each covering a distinct range of pitches and often with multiple singers each. We first evaluate some state-of-the-art multi-f0 estimation systems for the particular case of choirs with a single singer per part, and observe that the pitch of individual singers can be estimated to a relatively high degree of accuracy. We observe, however, that the scenario of multiple singers for each choir part (i.e. unison singing) is far more challenging. In this work we propose a methodology based on combining a multi-f0 estimation methodology based on deep learning followed by a set of traditional DSP techniques to model f0 and its dispersion instead of a single f0 trajectory for each choir part. We present and discuss our observations and test our framework with different singer configurations.
