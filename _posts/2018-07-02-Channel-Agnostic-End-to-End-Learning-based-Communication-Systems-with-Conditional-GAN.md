##### Abstract
In this article, we use deep neural networks (DNNs) to develop a wireless end-to-end communication system, in which DNNs are employed for all signal-related functionalities, such as encoding, decoding, modulation, and equalization. However, accurate instantaneous channel transfer function, \emph{i.e.}, the channel state information (CSI), is necessary to compute the gradient of the DNN representing. In many communication systems, the channel transfer function is hard to obtain in advance and varies with time and location. In this article, this constraint is released by developing a channel agnostic end-to-end system that does not rely on any prior information about the channel. We use a conditional generative adversarial net (GAN) to represent the channel effects, where the encoded signal of the transmitter will serve as the conditioning information. In addition, in order to deal with the time-varying channel, the received signal corresponding to the pilot data can also be added as a part of the conditioning information. From the simulation results, the proposed method is effective on additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) and Rayleigh fading channels, which opens a new door for building data-driven communication systems.

在本文中，我们使用深度神经网络（DNN）来开发无线端到端通信系统，其中DNN用于所有与信号相关的功能，例如编码，解码，调制和均衡。然而，准确的瞬时信道传递函数\ emph {即}，信道状态信息（CSI），是计算DNN表示的梯度所必需的。在许多通信系统中，信道传递功能很难提前获得并随时间和地点而变化。在本文中，通过开发与通道无关的端到端系统来释放此约束，该系统不依赖于有关通道的任何先前信息。我们使用条件生成对抗网（GAN）来表示信道效应，其中发射机的编码信号将用作条件信息。另外，为了处理时变信道，还可以添加与导频数据相对应的接收信号作为调节信息的一部分。仿真结果表明，该方法对加性高斯白噪声（AWGN）和瑞利衰落信道有效，为构建数据驱动通信系统打开了新的大门。
