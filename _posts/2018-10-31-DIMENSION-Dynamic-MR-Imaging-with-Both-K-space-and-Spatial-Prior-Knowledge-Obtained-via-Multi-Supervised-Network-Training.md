##### Abstract
Dynamic MR image reconstruction from incomplete k-space data has generated great research interest due to its capability in reducing scan time. Nevertheless, the reconstruction problem is still challenging due to its ill-posed nature. Most existing methods either suffered from long iterative reconstruction time or explored limited prior knowledge. This paper proposes a dynamic MR imaging method with both k-space and spatial prior knowledge integrated via multi-supervised network training, dubbed as DIMENSION. Specifically, DIMENSION consists of a Fourier prior network for k-space completion and a spatial prior network for capturing image structures and details. Furthermore, a multi-supervised network training technique is developed to constrain the frequency domain information and reconstruction results at different levels. The comparisons with k-t FOCUSS, k-t SLR, L+S and the state-of-the-art CNN method on in vivo datasets show our method can achieve improved reconstruction results in shorter time.
