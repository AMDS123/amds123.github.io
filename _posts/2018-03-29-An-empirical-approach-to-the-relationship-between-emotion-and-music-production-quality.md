##### Abstract
In music production, the role of the mix engineer is to take recorded music and convey the expressed emotions as professionally sounding as possible. We investigated the relationship between music production quality and musically induced and perceived emotions. A listening test was performed where 10 critical listeners and 10 non-critical listeners evaluated 10 songs. There were two mixes of each song, the low quality mix and the high quality mix. Each participant's subjective experience was measured directly through questionnaire and indirectly by examining peripheral physiological changes, change in facial expressions and the number of head nods and shakes they made as they listened to each mix. We showed that music production quality had more of an emotional impact on critical listeners. Also, critical listeners had significantly different emotional responses to non-critical listeners for the high quality mixes and to a lesser extent the low quality mixes. The findings suggest that having a high level of skill in mix engineering only seems to matter in an emotional context to a subset of music listeners.

在音乐制作中，混音师的角色就是录制音乐，并将表达的情感尽可能传达给专业人士。我们调查了音乐制作质量与音乐诱发和感知情绪之间的关系。进行了听力测试，其中10名关键听众和10名非关键听众评估了10首歌曲。每首歌曲有两种混音，低音混音和高音混音。每位参与者的主观经历直接通过调查问卷进行测量，间接通过检查周围生理变化，面部表情变化以及他们在听每种混合时所做的头部点头和摇头的次数来间接测量。我们发现音乐制作的质量对批判性听众有更多的情感影响。此外，关键听众对于非关键听众对高质量混音的情绪反应明显不同，对低质量混音的反应也较小。这些发现表明，在混音工程方面拥有高水平的技能似乎只是在情感上与音乐听众的一个子集有关系。
