##### Abstract
We report here the first RF noise measurements on two designs of n-doped GaN/AlN double-barrier resonant tunneling diodes (RTDs), each having a room-temperature negative differential resistance (NDR) and also strong near-UV light emission. The measurements are made with a standard, un-isolated RF receiver and calibration is made using a substitution-resistor/hot-cold radiometric technique which works in the positive differential resistance (PDR) region but not the NDR region. A high-quality InGaAs/AlAs double-barrier RTD is used as a control sample and displays shot noise suppression down to $\Gamma\approx$0.5 in the PDR region, as expected. The GaN/AlN RTDs display both shot-noise enhancement and suppression in the PDR regions, but no obvious sign of sudden shot-noise enhancement in the threshold bias region of light emission. This supports the hypothesis that the holes required for light emission are created by electronic (Zener) interband tunneling, not impact ionization. Further the minimum shot-noise factor of $\Gamma\sim$ 0.34 suggests that the GaN/AlN RTDs are acting like triple-barrier devices.
