##### Abstract
In this paper, we propose Dynamics Transfer GAN; a new method for generating video sequences based on generative adversarial learning. The spatial constructs of a generated video sequence are acquired from the target image. The dynamics of the generated video sequence are imported from a source video sequence, with arbitrary motion, and imposed onto the target image. To preserve the spatial construct of the target image, the appearance of the source video sequence is suppressed and only the dynamics are obtained before being imposed onto the target image. That is achieved using the proposed appearance suppressed dynamics feature. Moreover, the spatial and temporal consistencies of the generated video sequence are verified via two discriminator networks. One discriminator validates the fidelity of the generated frames appearance, while the other validates the dynamic consistency of the generated video sequence. Experiments have been conducted to verify the quality of the video sequences generated by the proposed method. The results verified that Dynamics Transfer GAN successfully transferred arbitrary dynamics of the source video sequence onto a target image when generating the output video sequence. The experimental results also showed that Dynamics Transfer GAN maintained the spatial constructs (appearance) of the target image while generating spatially and temporally consistent video sequences.
