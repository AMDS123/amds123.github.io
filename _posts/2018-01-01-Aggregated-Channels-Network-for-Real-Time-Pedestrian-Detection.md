##### Abstract
Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have demonstrated their superiority in numerous computer vision tasks, yet their computational cost results prohibitive for many real-time applications such as pedestrian detection which is usually performed on low-consumption hardware. In order to alleviate this drawback, most strategies focus on using a two-stage cascade approach. Essentially, in the first stage a fast method generates a significant but reduced amount of high quality proposals that later, in the second stage, are evaluated by the CNN. In this work, we propose a novel detection pipeline that further benefits from the two-stage cascade strategy. More concretely, the enriched and subsequently compressed features used in the first stage are reused as the CNN input. As a consequence, a simpler network architecture, adapted for such small input sizes, allows to achieve real-time performance and obtain results close to the state-of-the-art while running significantly faster without the use of GPU. In particular, considering that the proposed pipeline runs in frame rate, the achieved performance is highly competitive. We furthermore demonstrate that the proposed pipeline on itself can serve as an effective proposal generator.

卷积神经网络（CNNs）已经在众多的计算机视觉任务中证明了其优越性，但是其计算成本对于许多实时应用（例如通常在低功耗硬件上执行的行人检测）是不可行的。为了缓解这个缺点，大多数策略都集中在使用两阶段级联方法。实质上，在第一阶段，一个快速方法产生了一个显着但数量减少的高质量提案，后来在第二阶段由CNN进行评估。在这项工作中，我们提出了一个新的检测流水线，进一步受益于两阶段级联策略。更具体地说，在第一阶段中使用的丰富且随后被压缩的特征被重新用作CNN输入。因此，适用于如此小的输入尺寸的更简单的网络架构允许实现实时性能并获得接近现有技术的结果，而在不使用GPU的情况下运行速度明显更快。特别是，考虑到拟议的管道运行在帧速率，实现的性能是非常有竞争力的。我们进一步证明，提出的管道本身可以作为一个有效的提案发生器。
