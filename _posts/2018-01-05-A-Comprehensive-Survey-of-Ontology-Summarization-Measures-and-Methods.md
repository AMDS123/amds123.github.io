##### Abstract
The Semantic Web is becoming a large scale framework that enables data to be published, shared, and reused in the form of ontologies. The ontology which is considered as basic building block of semantic web consists of two layers including data and schema layer. With the current exponential development of ontologies in both data size and complexity of schemas, ontology understanding which is playing an important role in different tasks such as ontology engineering, ontology learning, etc., is becoming more difficult. Ontology summarization as a way to distill knowledge from an ontology and generate an abridge version to facilitate a better understanding is getting more attention recently. There are various approaches available for ontology summarization which are focusing on different measures in order to produce a proper summary for a given ontology. In this paper, we mainly focus on the common metrics which are using for ontology summarization and meet the state-of-the-art in ontology summarization.

##### Abstract (translated by Google)
语义Web正在成为一个大规模的框架，使得数据能够以本体的形式被发布，共享和重用。被认为是语义网的基本组成部分的本体由数据层和模式层两层构成。随着本体在数据规模和模式复杂度方面呈指数级增长，在本体工程，本体学习等不同任务中起着重要作用的本体理解变得越来越困难。本体概括作为一种从本体中提取知识的方法，并生成一个更加简洁的版本以促进更好的理解，这一点近来受到越来越多的关注。本体总结有多种方法可供选择，这些方法着重于不同的措施，以便对给定的本体进行适当的总结。在本文中，我们主要关注用于本体总结的通用度量标准，并且满足本体总结中的最新技术水平。
