##### Abstract
The rise of Artificial intelligence (AI) has the potential to significantly transform the practice of project management. Project management has a large socio-technical element with many uncertainties arising from variability in human aspects e.g., customers' needs, developers' performance and team dynamics. AI can assist project managers and team members by automating repetitive, high-volume tasks to enable project analytics for estimation and risk prediction, providing actionable recommendations, and even making decisions. AI is potentially a game changer for project management in helping to accelerate productivity and increase project success rates. In this paper, we propose a framework where AI technologies can be leveraged to offer support for managing agile projects, which have become increasingly popular in the industry.
