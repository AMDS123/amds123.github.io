##### Abstract
This paper presents a comprehensive survey on vision-based robotic grasping. We concluded four key tasks during robotic grasping, which are object localization, pose estimation, grasp detection and motion planning. In detail, object localization includes object detection and segmentation methods, pose estimation includes RGB-based and RGB-D-based methods, grasp detection includes traditional methods and deep learning-based methods, motion planning includes analytical methods, imitating learning methods, and reinforcement learning methods. Besides, lots of methods accomplish some of the tasks jointly, such as object-detection-combined 6D pose estimation, grasp detection without pose estimation, end-to-end grasp detection, and end-to-end motion planning. These methods are reviewed elaborately in this survey. What's more, related datasets are summarized and comparisons between state-of-the-art methods are given for each task. Challenges about robotic grasping are presented, and future directions in addressing these challenges are also pointed out.
