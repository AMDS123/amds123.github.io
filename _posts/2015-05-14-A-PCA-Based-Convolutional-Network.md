##### Abstract
In this paper, we propose a novel unsupervised deep learning model, called PCA-based Convolutional Network (PCN). The architecture of PCN is composed of several feature extraction stages and a nonlinear output stage. Particularly, each feature extraction stage includes two layers: a convolutional layer and a feature pooling layer. In the convolutional layer, the filter banks are simply learned by PCA. In the nonlinear output stage, binary hashing is applied. For the higher convolutional layers, the filter banks are learned from the feature maps that were obtained in the previous stage. To test PCN, we conducted extensive experiments on some challenging tasks, including handwritten digits recognition, face recognition and texture classification. The results show that PCN performs competitive with or even better than state-of-the-art deep learning models. More importantly, since there is no back propagation for supervised finetuning, PCN is much more efficient than existing deep networks.

在本文中，我们提出了一种新的无监督深度学习模型，称为基于PCA的卷积网络（PCN）。 PCN的体系结构由多个特征提取阶段和一个非线性输出阶段组成。特别地，每个特征提取阶段包括两个层：卷积层和特征合并层。在卷积层中，滤波器组简单地由PCA学习。在非线性输出阶段，应用二进制散列。对于较高卷积层，滤波器组从前一阶段获得的特征图中学习。为了测试PCN，我们对一些具有挑战性的任务进行了广泛的实验，包括手写数字识别，人脸识别和纹理分类。结果显示PCN与最先进的深度学习模型相比甚至更好。更重要的是，由于监督微调没有反向传播，PCN比现有的深度网络更有效率。
