##### Abstract
Dictionary learning methods can be split into two categories: i) class specific dictionary learning ii) class shared dictionary learning. The difference between the two categories is how to use the discriminative information. With the first category, samples of different classes are mapped to different subspaces which leads to some redundancy in the base vectors. For the second category, the samples in each specific class can not be described well. Moreover, most class shared dictionary learning methods use the L0-norm regularization term as the sparse constraint. In this paper, we first propose a novel class shared dictionary learning method named label embedded dictionary learning (LEDL) by introducing the L1-norm sparse constraint to replace the conventional L0-norm regularization term in LC-KSVD method. Then we propose a novel network named hybrid dictionary learning network (HDLN) to combine the class specific dictionary learning with class shared dictionary learning together to fully describe the feature to boost the performance of classification. Extensive experimental results on six benchmark datasets illustrate that our methods are capable of achieving superior performance compared to several conventional classification algorithms.
