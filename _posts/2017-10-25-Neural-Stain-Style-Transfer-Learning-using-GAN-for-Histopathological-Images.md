##### Abstract
Performance of data-driven network for tumor classification varies with stain-style of histopathological images. This article proposes the stain-style transfer (SST) model based on conditional generative adversarial networks (GANs) which is to learn not only the certain color distribution but also the corresponding histopathological pattern. Our model considers feature-preserving loss in addition to well-known GAN loss. Consequently our model does not only transfers initial stain-styles to the desired one but also prevent the degradation of tumor classifier on transferred images. The model is examined using the CAMELYON16 dataset.
