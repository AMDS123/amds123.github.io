##### Abstract
We propose a new sentence simplification task (Split-and-Rephrase) where the aim is to split a complex sentence into a meaning preserving sequence of shorter sentences. Like sentence simplification, splitting-and-rephrasing has the potential of benefiting both natural language processing and societal applications. Because shorter sentences are generally better processed by NLP systems, it could be used as a preprocessing step which facilitates and improves the performance of parsers, semantic role labellers and machine translation systems. It should also be of use for people with reading disabilities because it allows the conversion of longer sentences into shorter ones. This paper makes two contributions towards this new task. First, we create and make available a benchmark consisting of 1,066,115 tuples mapping a single complex sentence to a sequence of sentences expressing the same meaning. Second, we propose five models (vanilla sequence-to-sequence to semantically-motivated models) to understand the difficulty of the proposed task.

我们提出了一个新的句子简化任务（分裂和改写），其目的是将一个复杂句子分解成一个短语句子的意义保持序列。像简化句子一样，分裂和重新表述有利于自然语言处理和社会应用。因为较短的句子通常能被NLP系统更好地处理，所以它可以作为一个预处理步骤，促进和提高解析器，语义角色标签和机器翻译系统的性能。阅读障碍人士也应该使用它，因为它允许将较长的句子转换为较短的句子。本文对这一新任务做出了两点贡献。首先，我们创建并提供一个基准，包含1,066,115个元组，映射一个复杂句子到一个表达相同含义的句子序列。其次，我们提出五个模型（香草序列到序列到语义激励模型）来理解所提议的任务的难度。
