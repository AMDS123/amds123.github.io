##### Abstract
A brain-computer interface (BCI) is a system that aims for establishing a non-muscular communication path for subjects who had suffer from a neurodegenerative disease. Many BCI systems make use of the phenomena of event-related synchronization and de-synchronization of brain waves as a main feature for classification of different cognitive tasks. However, the temporal dynamics of the electroencephalographic (EEG) signals contain additional information that can be incorporated into the inference engine in order to improve the performance of the BCIs. This information about the dynamics of the signals have been exploited previously in BCIs by means of generative and discriminative methods. In particular, hidden Markov models (HMMs) have been used in previous works. These methods have the disadvantage that the model parameters such as the number of hidden states and the number of Gaussian mixtures need to be fix "a priori". In this work, we propose a Bayesian nonparametric model for brain signal classification that does not require "a priori" selection of the number of hidden states and the number of Gaussian mixtures of a HMM. The results show that the proposed model outperform other methods based on HMM as well as the winner algorithm of the BCI competition IV.

脑机接口（BCI）是一个系统，旨在为患有神经退行性疾病的受试者建立非肌肉沟通的通道。许多BCI系统利用脑电波事件相关同步和去同步的现象作为不同认知任务分类的主要特征。然而，脑电图（EEG）信号的时间动态包含了可以结合到推理引擎中的附加信息，以提高BCI的性能。这些关于信号动态的信息以前在BCI中已经通过生成和区分方法被利用。具体来说，隐马尔可夫模型（HMM）已被用于以前的作品。这些方法的缺点是隐藏状态的数量和高斯混合的数量等模型参数需要先验地确定。在这项工作中，我们提出了一个大脑信号分类的贝叶斯非参数模型，不需要“先验”选择隐藏状态的数量和HMM的高斯混合的数量。结果表明，所提出的模型优于基于HMM的其他方法以及BCI竞争IV的优胜者算法。
