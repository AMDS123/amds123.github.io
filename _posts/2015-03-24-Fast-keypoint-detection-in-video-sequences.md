##### Abstract
A number of computer vision tasks exploit a succinct representation of the visual content in the form of sets of local features. Given an input image, feature extraction algorithms identify a set of keypoints and assign to each of them a description vector, based on the characteristics of the visual content surrounding the interest point. Several tasks might require local features to be extracted from a video sequence, on a frame-by-frame basis. Although temporal downsampling has been proven to be an effective solution for mobile augmented reality and visual search, high temporal resolution is a key requirement for time-critical applications such as object tracking, event recognition, pedestrian detection, surveillance. In recent years, more and more computationally efficient visual feature detectors and decriptors have been proposed. Nonetheless, such approaches are tailored to still images. In this paper we propose a fast keypoint detection algorithm for video sequences, that exploits the temporal coherence of the sequence of keypoints. According to the proposed method, each frame is preprocessed so as to identify the parts of the input frame for which keypoint detection and description need to be performed. Our experiments show that it is possible to achieve a reduction in computational time of up to 40%, without significantly affecting the task accuracy.

许多计算机视觉任务利用本地特征集合形式的视觉内容的简洁表示。给定输入图像，特征提取算法识别一组关键点并基于感兴趣点周围的视觉内容的特征向其中的每一个分配描述向量。几个任务可能需要从视频序列中逐帧提取本地特征。虽然时间下采样已经被证明是移动增强现实和视觉搜索的有效解决方案，但高时间分辨率是时间关键应用（如对象跟踪，事件识别，行人检测，监视）的关键要求。近年来，越来越多的计算有效的视觉特征检测器和描述符被提出。尽管如此，这些方法是为静止图像量身定制的。在本文中，我们提出了一个视频序列的快速关键点检测算法，利用关键点序列的时间相关性。根据所提出的方法，对每个帧进行预处理，以识别需要执行关键点检测和描述的输入帧的部分。我们的实验表明，可以将计算时间缩短到40％，而不会显着影响任务的准确性。
