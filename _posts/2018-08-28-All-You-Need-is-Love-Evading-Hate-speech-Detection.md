##### Abstract
With the spread of social networks and their unfortunate use for hate speech, automatic detection of the latter has become a pressing problem. In this paper, we reproduce seven state-of-the-art hate speech detection models from prior work, and show that they perform well only when tested on the same type of data they were trained on. Based on these results, we argue that for successful hate speech detection, model architecture is less important than the type of data and labeling criteria. We further show that all proposed detection techniques are brittle against adversaries who can (automatically) insert typos, change word boundaries or add innocuous words to the original hate speech. A combination of these methods is also effective against Google Perspective -- a cutting-edge solution from industry. Our experiments demonstrate that adversarial training does not completely mitigate the attacks, and using character-level features makes the models systematically more attack-resistant than using word-level features.

随着社交网络的普及及其对仇恨言论的不幸使用，对后者的自动检测已成为一个迫切的问题。在本文中，我们从先前的工作中重现了七种最先进的仇恨语音检测模型，并表明它们只有在对它们所训练的相同类型的数据进行测试时才能表现良好。基于这些结果，我们认为对于成功的仇恨语音检测，模型体系结构不如数据类型和标签标准重要。我们进一步表明，所有提出的检测技术对于能够（自动）插入拼写错误，改变单词边界或在原始仇恨言论中添加无害单词的对手都是脆弱的。这些方法的组合对Google Perspective也是有效的 - 这是业界领先的解决方案。我们的实验表明，对抗性训练并不能完全缓解攻击，使用角色级功能可以使模型系统地比使用单词级功能更具抗攻击性。
