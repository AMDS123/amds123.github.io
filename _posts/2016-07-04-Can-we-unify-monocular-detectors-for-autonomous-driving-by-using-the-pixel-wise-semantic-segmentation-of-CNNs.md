##### Abstract
Autonomous driving is a challenging topic that requires complex solutions in perception tasks such as recognition of road, lanes, traffic signs or lights, vehicles and pedestrians. Through years of research, computer vision has grown capable of tackling these tasks with monocular detectors that can provide remarkable detection rates with relatively low processing times. However, the recent appearance of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) has revolutionized the computer vision field and has made possible approaches to perform full pixel-wise semantic segmentation in times close to real time (even on hardware that can be carried on a vehicle). In this paper, we propose to use full image segmentation as an approach to simplify and unify most of the detection tasks required in the perception module of an autonomous vehicle, analyzing major concerns such as computation time and detection performance.

##### Abstract (translated by Google)
自主驾驶是一个具有挑战性的话题，需要在识别道路，车道，交通标志或灯光，车辆和行人等感知任务时使用复杂的解决方案。通过多年的研究，计算机视觉已经能够利用单眼探测器来处理这些任务，这种探测器能够以相对较低的处理时间提供显着的检测率。然而，最近出现的卷积神经网络（CNN）已经使计算机视觉领域发生了革命性的变化，并且有可能在接近实时的时候（甚至在可以在车辆上运行的硬件上）进行全像素语义分割。在本文中，我们提出使用全图像分割作为一种方法来简化和统一自主车辆的感知模块所需的大部分检测任务，分析计算时间和检测性能等主要问题。
