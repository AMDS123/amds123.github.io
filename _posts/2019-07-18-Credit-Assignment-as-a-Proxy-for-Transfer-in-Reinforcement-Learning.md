##### Abstract
The ability to transfer representations to novel environments and tasks is a sensible requirement for general learning agents. Despite the apparent promises, transfer in Reinforcement Learning is still an open and under-exploited research area. In this paper, we suggest that credit assignment, regarded as a supervised learning task, could be used to accomplish transfer. Our contribution is twofold: we introduce a new credit assignment mechanism based on self-attention, and show that the learned credit can be transferred to in-domain and out-of-domain scenarios.
