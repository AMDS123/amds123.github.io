##### Abstract
Neural networks based vocoders, typically the WaveNet, have achieved spectacular performance for text-to-speech (TTS) in recent years. Although state-of-the-art parallel WaveNet has addressed the issue of real-time waveform generation, there remains problems. Firstly, due to the noisy input signal of the model, there is still a gap between the quality of generated and natural waveforms. Secondly, a parallel WaveNet is trained under a distilled training framework, which makes it tedious to adapt a well trained model to a new speaker. To address these two problems, this paper proposes an end-to-end adaptation method based on the generative adversarial network (GAN), which can reduce the computational cost for the training of new speaker adaptation. Our subjective experiments shows that the proposed training method can further reduce the quality gap between generated and natural waveforms.
