##### Abstract
Purpose: The motion of the common carotid artery tissue layers along the vessel axis during the cardiac cycle, observed in ultrasound imaging, is associated with the presence of established cardiovascular risk factors. However, the vast majority of the methods are based on the tracking of a single point, thus failing to capture the overall motion of the entire arterial wall. The aim of this work is to introduce a motion tracking framework able to simultaneously extract the trajectory of a large collection of points spanning the entire exploitable width of the image. 
 Method: The longitudinal motion, which is the main focus of the present work, is determined in two steps. First, a series of independent block matching operations are carried out for all the tracked points. Then, an original dynamic-programming approach is exploited to regularize the collection of similarity maps and estimate the globally optimal motion over the entire vessel wall. Sixty-two atherosclerotic participants at high cardiovascular risk were involved in this study. 
 Results: A dense displacement field, describing the longitudinal motion of the carotid far wall over time, was extracted. For each cine-loop, the method was evaluated against manual reference tracings performed on three local points, with an average absolute error of 150+/-163 um. A strong correlation was found between motion inhomogeneity and the presence of coronary artery disease (beta-coefficient=0.484, p=0.003). 
 Conclusions: To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that a method is specifically proposed to assess the dense motion field of the carotid far wall. This approach has potential to evaluate the (in)homogeneity of the wall dynamics. The proposed method has promising performances to improve the analysis of arterial longitudinal motion and the understanding of the underlying patho-physiological parameters.

目的：在超声成像中观察到的心动周期期间颈总动脉组织层沿血管轴的运动与已确定的心血管危险因素的存在相关。然而，绝大多数方法基于单个点的跟踪，因此未能捕获整个动脉壁的整体运动。这项工作的目的是引入一个运动跟踪框架，能够同时提取跨越整个可利用的图像宽度的大量点的轨迹。
 方法：纵向运动是本工作的主要焦点，分两步确定。首先，对所有跟踪点执行一系列独立的块匹配操作。然后，利用原始动态规划方法来规范相似性图的集合并估计整个血管壁上的全局最佳运动。本研究纳入了62名高心血管风险的动脉粥样硬化参与者。
 结果：提取了一个密集的位移场，描述了颈动脉远壁随时间的纵向运动。对于每个电影回路，该方法针对在三个局部点上执行的手动参考迹线进行评估，平均绝对误差为150 +/- 163um。运动不均匀性与冠状动脉疾病的存在之间存在很强的相关性（β系数= 0.484，p = 0.003）。
 结论：据我们所知，这是第一次专门提出一种方法来评估颈动脉远壁的密集运动场。这种方法有可能评估墙体动力学的（同）均匀性。该方法具有良好的性能，可以改善动脉纵向运动的分析和对潜在病理生理参数的理解。
