##### Abstract
Smartphones, smartwatches, fitness trackers, and ad-hoc wearable devices are being increasingly used to monitor human activities. Data acquired by the hosted sensors are usually processed by machine-learning-based algorithms to classify human activities. The success of those algorithms mostly depends on the availability of training (labeled) data that, if made publicly available, would allow researchers to make objective comparisons between techniques. Nowadays, publicly available data sets are few, often contain samples from subjects with too similar characteristics, and very often lack of specific information so that is not possible to select subsets of samples according to specific criteria. In this article, we present a new dataset of acceleration samples acquired with an Android smartphone designed for human activity recognition and fall detection. The dataset includes 11,771 samples of both human activities and falls performed by 30 subjects of ages ranging from 18 to 60 years. Samples are divided in 17 fine grained classes grouped in two coarse grained classes: one containing samples of 9 types of activities of daily living (ADL) and the other containing samples of 8 types of falls. The dataset has been stored to include all the information useful to select samples according to different criteria, such as the type of ADL, the age, the gender, and so on. Finally, the dataset has been benchmarked with four different classifiers and with two different feature vectors. We evaluated four different classification tasks: fall vs no fall, 9 activities, 8 falls, 17 activities and falls. For each classification task we performed a subject-dependent and independent evaluation. The major findings of the evaluation are the following: i) it is more difficult to distinguish between types of falls than types of activities; ii) subject-dependent evaluation outperforms the subject-independent one

智能手机，智能手表，健身追踪器和专用可穿戴设备越来越多地用于监控人类活动。通过托管传感器获取的数据通常通过基于机器学习的算法进行处理，以对人类活动进行分类。这些算法的成功主要取决于培训（标记）数据的可用性，如果公开可用，将允许研究人员在技术之间进行客观的比较。目前，公开可用的数据集很少，通常包含来自具有过于相似特征的主题的样本，并且通常缺乏具体信息，因此根据特定标准不可能选择样本的子集。在这篇文章中，我们提出了一个用Android智能手机获取的加速度样本的新数据集，用于人类活动识别和跌倒检测。该数据集包括11,771个人类活动样本以及由30至18岁至60岁年龄段的30名受试者进行的跌倒。样本分为17个细粒度类别，分为两个粗粒度类别：一个包含9种日常生活活动（ADL）样本，另一个样本包含8种类型的跌倒样本。数据集已被存储以包括根据不同标准（例如ADL的类型，年龄，性别等）选择样本有用的所有信息。最后，数据集已经用四个不同的分类器和两个不同的特征向量进行基准测试。我们评估了四个不同的分类任务：下降与不下降，9个活动，8个下降，17个活动和下降。对于每个分类任务，我们进行了一个依赖于对象的独立评估。评估的主要结论如下：（1）比类型的活动更难于区分摔倒的类型; ii）依赖于对象的评估优于独立于对象的评估
