##### Abstract
Spoken question answering (SQA) is challenging due to complex reasoning on top of the spoken documents. The recent studies have also shown the catastrophic impact of automatic speech recognition (ASR) errors on SQA. Therefore, this work proposes to mitigate the ASR errors by aligning the mismatch between ASR hypotheses and their corresponding reference transcriptions. An adversarial model is applied to this domain adaptation task, which forces the model to learn domain-invariant features the QA model can effectively utilize in order to improve the SQA results. The experiments successfully demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed model, and the results are better than the previous best model by 2% EM score.
