##### Abstract
Data scarcity has refrained deep learning models from making greater progress in prostate images analysis using multiparametric MRI. In this paper, an efficient convolutional neural network (CNN) was developed to classify lesion malignancy for prostate cancer patients, based on which model interpretation was systematically analyzed to bridge the gap between natural images and MR images, which is the first one of its kind in the literature. The problem of small sample size was addressed and successfully tackled by feeding the intermediate features into a traditional classification algorithm known as weighted extreme learning machine, with imbalanced distribution among output categories taken into consideration. Model trained on public data set was able to generalize to data from an independent institution to make accurate prediction. The generated saliency map was found to overlay well with the lesion and could benefit clinicians for diagnosing purpose.
