##### Abstract
Skin detection is the process of discriminating skin and non-skin regions in a digital image and it is widely used in several applications ranging from hand gesture analysis to tracking body parts and face detection. Skin detection is a challenging problem which has drawn extensive attention from the research community, nevertheless a fair comparison among approaches is very difficult due to the lack of a common benchmark and a unified testing protocol. In this work, we investigate the most recent research in this field and we propose a fair comparison among approaches using several different datasets. The major contributions of this work is a framework to evaluate and combine different skin detector approaches, whose source code will be made freely available for future research, and an extensive experimental comparison among several recent methods which have also been used to define an ensemble that works well in many different problems. Experiments are carried out in 10 different datasets including more than 10000 labelled images: experimental results confirm that the ensemble here proposed obtains a very good performance with respect to other stand-alone approaches, without requiring ad hoc parameter tuning. A MATLAB version of the framework for testing and ensemble proposed in this paper will be freely available from (https://www.dei.unipd.it/node/2357 + Pattern Recognition and Ensemble Classifiers).
