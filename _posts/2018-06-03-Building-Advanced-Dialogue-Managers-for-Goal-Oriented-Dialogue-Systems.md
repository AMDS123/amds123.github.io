##### Abstract
Goal-Oriented (GO) Dialogue Systems, colloquially known as goal oriented chatbots, help users achieve a predefined goal (e.g. book a movie ticket) within a closed domain. A first step is to understand the user's goal by using natural language understanding techniques. Once the goal is known, the bot must manage a dialogue to achieve that goal, which is conducted with respect to a learnt policy. The success of the dialogue system depends on the quality of the policy, which is in turn reliant on the availability of high-quality training data for the policy learning method, for instance Deep Reinforcement Learning. 
 Due to the domain specificity, the amount of available data is typically too low to allow the training of good dialogue policies. In this master thesis we introduce a transfer learning method to mitigate the effects of the low in-domain data availability. Our transfer learning based approach improves the bot's success rate by $20\%$ in relative terms for distant domains and we more than double it for close domains, compared to the model without transfer learning. Moreover, the transfer learning chatbots learn the policy up to 5 to 10 times faster. Finally, as the transfer learning approach is complementary to additional processing such as warm-starting, we show that their joint application gives the best outcomes.

面向目标（GO）的对话系统（俗称目标导向聊天机器人）可帮助用户在封闭域内实现预定义的目标（例如预订电影票）。第一步是通过使用自然语言理解技术来理解用户的目标。一旦目标已知，机器人必须管理对话以实现该目标，这是针对学习策略进行的。对话系统的成功取决于政策的质量，政策的质量又取决于政策学习方法的高质量培训数据的可用性，例如深度强化学习。
 由于领域的特殊性，可用数据的数量通常太低，无法培训良好的对话政策。在这篇硕士论文中，我们介绍了一种转移学习方法来减轻低域内数据可用性的影响。基于转移学习的方法将机器人的成功率提高了20％，相对于遥远领域而言，相比没有转移学习的模型，我们的成功率提高了近一倍。而且，转移学习chatbots的学习速度提高了5到10倍。最后，由于转移学习方法是对诸如热启动等附加处理的补充，我们表明它们的联合应用提供了最佳结果。
