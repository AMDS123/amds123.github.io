##### Abstract
We present opinion recommendation, a novel task of jointly predicting a custom review with a rating score that a certain user would give to a certain product or service, given existing reviews and rating scores to the product or service by other users, and the reviews that the user has given to other products and services. A characteristic of opinion recommendation is the reliance of multiple data sources for multi-task joint learning, which is the strength of neural models. We use a single neural network to model users and products, capturing their correlation and generating customised product representations using a deep memory network, from which customised ratings and reviews are constructed jointly. Results show that our opinion recommendation system gives ratings that are closer to real user ratings on Yelp.com data compared with Yelp's own ratings, and our methods give better results compared to several pipelines baselines using state-of-the-art sentiment rating and summarization systems.

我们提出了意见建议，这是一个新的任务，联合预测一个特定的用户会给某个产品或服务的评级分数的自定义评论，给出其他用户对产品或服务的现有评论和评分，用户已经给其他产品和服务。意见建议的特点是多个数据源对多任务联合学习的依赖，这是神经模型的强项。我们使用单个神经网络对用户和产品进行建模，捕获它们之间的关联，并使用深度记忆网络生成定制的产品表示，从中共同构建定制的评分和评论。结果显示，与Yelp自己的评级相比，我们的意见建议系统给出的评级与Yelp.com数据上的实际用户评级更接近，并且与使用最新情绪评级和汇总的多个管道基线相比，我们的方法给出更好的结果系统。
