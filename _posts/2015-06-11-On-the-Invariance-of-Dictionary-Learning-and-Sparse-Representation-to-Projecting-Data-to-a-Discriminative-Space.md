##### Abstract
In this paper, it is proved that dictionary learning and sparse representation is invariant to a linear transformation. It subsumes the special case of transforming/projecting the data into a discriminative space. This is important because recently, supervised dictionary learning algorithms have been proposed, which suggest to include the category information into the learning of dictionary to improve its discriminative power. Among them, there are some approaches that propose to learn the dictionary in a discriminative projected space. To this end, two approaches have been proposed: first, assigning the discriminative basis as the dictionary and second, perform dictionary learning in the projected space. Based on the invariance of dictionary learning to any transformation in general, and to a discriminative space in particular, we advocate the first approach.

在本文中，证明了字典学习和稀疏表示对线性变换是不变的。它包含了将数据转换/投影到有区别的空间的特殊情况。这是很重要的，因为最近已经提出了监督字典学习算法，它建议将类别信息包括在字典学习中以提高其判别能力。其中，有一些方法提出在歧视投影空间学习字典。为此，提出了两种方法：首先，将判别基础分配为词典，然后在投影空间中进行词典学习。基于字典学习对任何一般转换的不变性，特别是在一个有区别的空间，我们主张第一种方法。
