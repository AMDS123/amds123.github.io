##### Abstract
A method to produce personalized classification models to automatically review online dating profiles on Tinder is proposed, based on the user's historical preference. The method takes advantage of a FaceNet facial classification model to extract features which may be related to facial attractiveness. The embeddings from a FaceNet model were used as the features to describe an individual's face. A user reviewed 8,545 online dating profiles. For each reviewed online dating profile, a feature set was constructed from the profile images which contained just one face. Two approaches are presented to go from the set of features for each face, to a set of profile features. A simple logistic regression trained on the embeddings from just 20 profiles could obtain a 65% validation accuracy. A point of diminishing marginal returns was identified to occur around 80 profiles, at which the model accuracy of 73% would only improve marginally after reviewing a significant number of additional profiles.

基于用户的历史偏好，提出了一种生成个性化分类模型以自动审查Tinder的在线约会简档的方法。该方法利用FaceNet脸部分类模型来提取可能与面部吸引力有关的特征。来自FaceNet模型的嵌入被用作描述个人脸部的特征。一位用户查看了8,545个在线约会个人资料。对于每个审查的在线约会个人资料，一个功能集是从包含一张脸的个人资料图像中构建的。提出了两种方法从每个面的特征集到一组轮廓特征。对来自20个配置文件的嵌入进行简单的逻辑回归训练可以获得65％的验证准确度。发现边际收益递减的点大约发生在80个配置文件中，其中73％的模型准确性只有在审查了大量额外配置文件后才略有改善。
