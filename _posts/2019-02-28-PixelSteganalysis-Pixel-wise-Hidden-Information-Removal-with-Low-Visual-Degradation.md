##### Abstract
It is difficult to detect and remove secret images that are hidden in natural images using deep-learning algorithms. Our technique is the first work to effectively disable covert communications and transactions that use deep-learning steganography. We address the problem by exploiting sophisticated pixel distributions and edge areas of images using a deep neural network. Based on the given information, we adaptively remove secret information at the pixel level. We also introduce a new quantitative metric called destruction rate since the decoding method of deep-learning steganography is approximate (lossy), which is different from conventional steganography. We evaluate our technique using three public benchmarks in comparison with conventional steganalysis methods and show that the decoding rate improves by 10 ~ 20%.
