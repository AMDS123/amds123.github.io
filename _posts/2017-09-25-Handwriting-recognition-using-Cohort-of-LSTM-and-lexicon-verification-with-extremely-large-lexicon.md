##### Abstract
State-of-the-art methods for handwriting recognition are based on Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) recurrent neural networks (RNN), which now provides very impressive character recognition performance. The character recognition is generally coupled with a lexicon driven decoding process which integrates dictionaries. Unfortunately these dictionaries are limited to hundred of thousands words for the best systems, which prevent from having a good language coverage, and therefore limit the global recognition performance. In this article, we propose an alternative to the lexicon driven decoding process based on a lexicon verification process, coupled with an original cascade architecture. The cascade is made of a large number of complementary networks extracted from a single training (called cohort), making the learning process very light. The proposed method achieves new state-of-the art word recognition performance on the Rimes and IAM databases. Dealing with gigantic lexicon of 3 millions words, the methods also demonstrates interesting performance with a fast decision stage.

用于手写识别的最先进的方法基于长期短期记忆（LSTM）递归神经网络（RNN），现在提供非常令人印象深刻的字符识别性能。字符识别通常与集成词典的词典驱动解码过程相结合。不幸的是，这些字典对于最好的系统而言限于成千上万字，这妨碍了良好的语言覆盖，并因此限制了全球识别性能。在本文中，我们提出了基于词典验证过程的词典驱动解码过程的替代方案，并结合原始级联体系结构。级联是由大量从单一训练（称为队列）中提取的补充网络组成的，使得学习过程非常轻松。所提出的方法在Rimes和IAM数据库上实现了最新的文字识别性能。处理300万字巨大的词汇，这些方法也展示了一个快速决策阶段的有趣表现。
