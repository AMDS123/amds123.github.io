##### Abstract
Automatic detection of lymphocyte in H&E images is a necessary first step in lots of tissue image analysis algorithms. An accurate and robust automated lymphocyte detection approach is of great importance in both computer science and clinical studies. Most of the existing approaches for lymphocyte detection are based on traditional image processing algorithms and/or classic machine learning methods. In the recent years, deep learning techniques have fundamentally transformed the way that a computer interprets images and have become a matchless solution in various pattern recognition problems. In this work, we design a new deep neural network model which extends the fully convolutional network by combining the ideas in several recent techniques, such as shortcut links. Also, we design a new training scheme taking the prior knowledge about lymphocytes into consideration. The training scheme not only efficiently exploits the limited amount of free-form annotations from pathologists, but also naturally supports efficient fine-tuning. As a consequence, our model has the potential of self-improvement by leveraging the errors collected during real applications. Our experiments show that our deep neural network model achieves good performance in the images of different staining conditions or different types of tissues.

自动检测H＆E图像中的淋巴细胞是许多组织图像分析算法的必要的第一步。准确而强大的自动淋巴细胞检测方法在计算机科学和临床研究中都是非常重要的。大多数现有的淋巴细胞检测方法是基于传统的图像处理算法和/或经典的机器学习方法。近年来，深度学习技术从根本上改变了计算机对图像的解读方式，成为各种模式识别问题的无可匹敌的解决方案。在这项工作中，我们设计了一个新的深度神经网络模型，它通过结合最近的几种技术（如快捷链接）的思想来扩展完全卷积网络。此外，我们设计了一个新的训练方案，考虑到淋巴细胞的先验知识。培训计划不仅有效地利用了病理学家有限的自由形式注释，而且自然地支持有效的微调。因此，我们的模型通过利用在实际应用中收集的错误，具有自我提高的潜力。我们的实验表明，我们的深层神经网络模型在不同染色条件或不同类型的组织的图像中取得了良好的性能。
