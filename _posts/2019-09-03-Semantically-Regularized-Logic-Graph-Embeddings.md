##### Abstract
In this work, we aim to utilize prior knowledge encoded as logical rules to improve the performance of deep models. We propose a logic graph embedding network that projects d-DNNF formulae (and assignments) onto a manifold via an augmented Graph Convolutional Network (GCN). To generate semantically-faithful embeddings, we propose techniques to recognize node heterogeneity, and semantic regularization that incorporate structural constraints into the embedding. Experiments show that our approach improves the performance of models trained to perform model-checking and visual relation prediction.
