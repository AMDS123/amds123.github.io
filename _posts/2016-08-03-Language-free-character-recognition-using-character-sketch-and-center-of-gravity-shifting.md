##### Abstract
In this research, we present a heuristic method for character recognition. For this purpose, a sketch is constructed from the image that contains the character to be recognized. This sketch contains the most important pixels of image that are representatives of original image. These points are the most probable points in pixel-by-pixel matching of image that adapt to target image. Furthermore, a technique called gravity shifting is utilized for taking over the problem of elongation of characters. The consequence of combining sketch and gravity techniques leaded to a language free character recognition method. This method can be implemented independently for real-time uses or in combination of other classifiers as a feature extraction algorithm. Low complexity and acceptable performance are the most impressive features of this method that let it to be simply implemented in mobile and battery-limited computing devices. Results show that in the best case 86% of accuracy is obtained and in the worst case 28% of recognized characters are accurate.

在这个研究中，我们提出了一种启发式的字符识别方法。为此，从包含要识别的字符的图像构建草图。该草图包含原始图像的代表图像的最重要的像素。这些点是适应目标图像的图像的逐像素匹配中最可能的点。此外，利用称为重力移位的技术来解决字符伸长的问题。结合素描和重力技术的结果导致了一种无语言的字符识别方法。这种方法可以独立实现实时使用，也可以结合其他分类器作为特征提取算法。低复杂性和可接受的性能是这种方法最令人印象深刻的特征，它使其能够在移动和电池受限的计算设备中简单实现。结果表明，在最好的情况下，获得86％的准确性，在最坏的情况下，28％的识别字符是准确的。
