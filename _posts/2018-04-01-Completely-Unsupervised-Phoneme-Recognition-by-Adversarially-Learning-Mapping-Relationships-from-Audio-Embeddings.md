##### Abstract
Unsupervised discovery of acoustic tokens from audio corpora without annotation and learning vector representations for these tokens have been widely studied. Although these techniques have been shown successful in some applications such as query-by-example Spoken Term Detection (STD), the lack of mapping relationships between these discovered tokens and real phonemes have limited the down-stream applications. This paper represents probably the first attempt towards the goal of completely unsupervised phoneme recognition, or mapping audio signals to phoneme sequences without phoneme-labeled audio data. The basic idea is to cluster the embedded acoustic tokens and learn the mapping between the cluster sequences and the unknown phoneme sequences with a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN). An unsupervised phoneme recognition accuracy of 36% was achieved in the preliminary experiments.

无监督地从音频语料库中发现没有注释的声学标记并且学习这些标记的向量表示已被广泛研究。尽管这些技术在某些应用中已经显示出成功，例如按语音查询（STD）进行查询，但这些发现的令牌与真实音素之间缺乏映射关系限制了下游应用。本文可能是实现完全无监督音素识别目标的第一次尝试，或者将音频信号映射到音素序列而不使用音素标记的音频数据。其基本思想是利用生成对抗网络（GAN）对嵌入的声音令牌进行聚类并学习群集序列与未知音素序列之间的映射。在初步实验中获得36％的无监督音素识别准确度。
