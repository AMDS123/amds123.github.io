##### Abstract
Deluge Networks (DelugeNets) are deep neural networks which efficiently facilitate massive cross-layer information inflows from preceding layers to succeeding layers. The connections between layers in DelugeNets are established through cross-layer depthwise convolutional layers with learnable filters, acting as a flexible yet efficient selection mechanism. DelugeNets can propagate information across many layers with greater flexibility and utilize network parameters more effectively compared to ResNets, whilst being more efficient than DenseNets. Remarkably, a DelugeNet model with just model complexity of 4.31 GigaFLOPs and 20.2M network parameters, achieve classification errors of 3.76% and 19.02% on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 dataset respectively. Moreover, DelugeNet-122 performs competitively to ResNet-200 on ImageNet dataset, despite costing merely half of the computations needed by the latter.

Deluge网络（DelugeNets）是深度神经网络，有效地促进了从前一层到后一层的大量跨层信息流入。 DelugeNets中的层之间的连接是通过具有可学习过滤器的跨层深度卷积层来建立的，充当了灵活而高效的选择机制。与ResNets相比，DelugeNets可以更灵活地传播信息，并且更有效地利用网络参数，同时比DenseNets更有效。值得注意的是，一个模型复杂度为4.31 GigaFLOPs和20.2M网络参数的DelugeNet模型在CIFAR-10和CIFAR-100数据集上的分类误差分别为3.76％和19.02％。而且，DelugeNet-122在ImageNet数据集上对ResNet-200进行竞争性的研究，尽管只花费了后者所需的一半计算量。
