##### Abstract
Understanding human actions in visual data is tied to advances in complementary research areas including object recognition, human dynamics, domain adaptation and semantic segmentation. Over the last decade, human action analysis evolved from earlier schemes that are often limited to controlled environments to nowadays advanced solutions that can learn from millions of videos and apply to almost all daily activities. Given the broad range of applications from video surveillance to human-computer interaction, scientific milestones in action recognition are achieved more rapidly, eventually leading to the demise of what used to be good in a short time. This motivated us to provide a comprehensive review of the notable steps taken towards recognizing human actions. To this end, we start our discussion with the pioneering methods that use handcrafted representations, and then, navigate into the realm of deep learning based approaches. We aim to remain objective throughout this survey, touching upon encouraging improvements as well as inevitable fallbacks, in the hope of raising fresh questions and motivating new research directions for the reader.

##### Abstract (translated by Google)
理解视觉数据中的人为行为与互补研究领域的进展密切相关，包括对象识别，人体动力学，领域适应和语义分割。在过去的十年中，人类行为分析从早期的计划发展而来，这些计划往往局限于受控环境，现在可以从数百万的视频中学习，适用于几乎所有的日常活动。鉴于从视频监控到人机交互等广泛的应用，动作识别的科学进展更快，最终导致短时间内良好的消亡。这促使我们全面回顾了认识到人类行为所采取的显着步骤。为此，我们开始与使用手工表示的开创性方法进行讨论，然后进入基于深度学习的方法的领域。我们的目标是在整个调查过程中保持客观，触及令人鼓舞的改善以及不可避免的倒退，希望为读者提出新的问题和激发新的研究方向。
