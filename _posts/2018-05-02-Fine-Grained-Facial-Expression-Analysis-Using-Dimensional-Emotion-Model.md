##### Abstract
Automated facial expression analysis has a variety of applications in human-computer interaction. Traditional methods mainly analyze prototypical facial expressions of no more than eight discrete emotions as a classification task. However, in practice, spontaneous facial expressions in naturalistic environment can represent not only a wide range of emotions, but also different intensities within an emotion family. In such situation, these methods are not reliable or adequate. In this paper, we propose to train deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to analyze facial expressions explainable in a dimensional emotion model. The proposed method accommodates not only a set of basic emotion expressions, but also a full range of other emotions and subtle emotion intensities that we both feel in ourselves and perceive in others in our daily life. Specifically, we first mapped facial expressions into dimensional measures so that we transformed facial expression analysis from a classification problem to a regression one. We then tested our CNN-based methods for facial expression regression and these methods demonstrated promising performance. Moreover, we improved our method by a bilinear pooling which encodes second-order statistics of features. We showed such bilinear-CNN models significantly outperformed their respective baselines.

自动化的面部表情分析在人机交互中有很多应用。传统方法主要分析不超过八个离散情绪的原型面部表情作为分类任务。然而，实际上，自然环境中的自发面部表情不仅可以代表广泛的情绪，而且可以代表情绪家庭中的不同强度。在这种情况下，这些方法不可靠或不够。在本文中，我们提出训练深度卷积神经网络（CNN）来分析在维度情感模型中可解释的面部表情。所提出的方法不仅适应一组基本情绪表达，而且还适应我们都在自己身上感受到并在我们日常生活中感受到的其他情绪和微妙情绪强度的全部范围。具体而言，我们首先将面部表情映射为维度量度，以便将面部表情分析从分类问题转换为回归问题。然后，我们测试了基于CNN的面部表情回归方法，并且这些方法表现出有前途的表现。此外，我们通过编码特征的二阶统计量的双线性池来改进我们的方法。我们发现这样的双线性CNN模型显着地超过了它们各自的基线。
