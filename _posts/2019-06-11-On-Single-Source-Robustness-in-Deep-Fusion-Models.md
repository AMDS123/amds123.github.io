##### Abstract
Algorithms that fuse multiple input sources benefit from both complementary and shared information. Shared information may provide robustness to faulty or noisy inputs, which is indispensable for safety-critical applications like self-driving cars. We investigate learning fusion algorithms that are robust against noise added to a single source. We first demonstrate that robustness against single source noise is not guaranteed in a linear fusion model. Motivated by this discovery, two possible approaches are proposed to increase robustness: a carefully designed loss with corresponding training algorithms for deep fusion models, and a simple convolutional fusion layer that has a structural advantage in dealing with noise. Experimental results show that both training algorithms and our fusion layer make a deep fusion-based 3D object detector robust against noise applied to a single source, while preserving the original performance on clean data.
