##### Abstract
Machine learning (ML) has become a core component of many real-world applications and training data is a key factor that drives current progress. This huge success has led Internet companies to deploy machine learning as a service (MLaaS). Recently, the first membership inference attack has shown that extraction of information on the training set is possible in such MLaaS settings, which has severe security and privacy implications. 
 However, the early demonstrations of the feasibility of such attacks have many assumptions on the adversary such as using multiple so-called shadow models, knowledge of the target model structure and having a dataset from the same distribution as the target model's training data. We relax all 3 key assumptions, thereby showing that such attacks are very broadly applicable at low cost and thereby pose a more severe risk than previously thought. We present the most comprehensive study so far on this emerging and developing threat using eight diverse datasets which show the viability of the proposed attacks across domains. 
 In addition, we propose the first effective defense mechanisms against such broader class of membership inference attacks that maintain a high level of utility of the ML model.

机器学习（ML）已成为许多实际应用程序的核心组件，培训数据是推动当前进展的关键因素。这一巨大成功促使互联网公司将机器学习作为服务部署（MLaaS）。最近，第一次会员推理攻击表明，在这种MLaaS设置中可能提取训练集中的信息，这具有严重的安全性和隐私影响。
 然而，早期证明这种攻击的可行性在对手方面有很多假设，例如使用多个所谓的影子模型，目标模型结构的知识以及与目标模型的训练数据具有相同分布的数据集。我们放宽了所有3个关键假设，从而表明这种攻击在低成本下非常广泛地适用，从而带来比以前想象的更严重的风险。我们利用八个不同的数据集展示了迄今为止关于这个新兴和正在发展的威胁的最全面的研究，这些数据集显示了跨领域提出的攻击的可行性。
 另外，我们提出了第一个有效的防御机制来抵御这类更广泛的成员推理攻击，这些攻击保持了ML模型的高效用。
