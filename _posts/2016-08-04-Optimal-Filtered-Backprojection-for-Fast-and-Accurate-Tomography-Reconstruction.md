##### Abstract
Tomographic reconstruction is a method of reconstructing a high dimensional image with a series of its low dimensional projections, and the filtered backprojection is one of very popular analytical techniques for the reconstruction due to its computational efficiency and easy of implementation. The accuracy of the filtered backprojection method deteriorates when input data are noisy or input data are available for only a limited number of projection angles. For the case, some algebraic approaches perform better, but they are based on computationally slow iterations. We propose an improvement of the filtered backprojection method which is as fast as the existing filtered backprojection and is as accurate as the algebraic approaches under heavy observation noises and limited availability of projection data. The new approach optimizes the filter of the backprojection operator to minimize a regularized reconstruction error. We compare the new approach with the state-of-the-art in the filtered backprojection and algebraic approaches using four simulated datasets to show its competitive accuracy and computing speed.

层析重建是一种利用一系列低维投影重建高维图像的方法，滤波反投影是计算效率高，易于实现的非常流行的重建分析技术之一。当输入数据有噪声或输入数据只能用于有限数量的投影角度时，滤波反投影方法的精度会降低。对于这种情况，一些代数方法执行得更好，但它们是基于计算缓慢的迭代。我们提出了一种改进的滤波反投影方法，其与现有的滤波反投影一样快，并且在重观测噪声和投影数据的有限可用性下与代数方法一样精确。新方法优化了反投影算子的滤波器，以最小化正则化的重构误差。我们使用四个模拟数据集比较了新方法和滤波反投影和代数方法的最新技术，以显示其竞争精度和计算速度。
