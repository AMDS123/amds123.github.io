##### Abstract
The interests of individual internet users fall into a hierarchical structure which is useful in regards to building personalized searches and recommendations. Most studies on this subject construct the interest hierarchy of a single person from the document perspective. In this study, we constructed the user interest hierarchy via user profiles. We organized 433,397 user interests, referred to here as "attentions", into a user attention network (UAN) from 200 million user profiles; we then applied the Louvain algorithm to detect hierarchical clusters in these attentions. Finally, a 26-level hierarchy with 34,676 clusters was obtained. We found that these attention clusters were aggregated according to certain topics as opposed to the hyponymy-relation based conceptual ontologies. The topics can be entities or concepts, and the relations were not restrained by hyponymy. The concept relativity encapsulated in the user's interest can be captured by labeling the attention clusters with corresponding concepts.

个人互联网用户的兴趣属于等级结构，在建立个性化搜索和建议方面是有用的。大多数关于这个主题的研究从文档的角度构建了一个人的兴趣层次结构。在这项研究中，我们通过用户配置文件构建了用户兴趣层次。我们将用户兴趣（这里称为“关注”）从2亿个用户简档中组织为用户兴趣网络（UAN），共计433397个用户兴趣;然后，我们应用Louvain算法来检测这些关注中的分层聚类。最后，获得了34,676个集群的26层次的层次结构。我们发现，这些注意力集群按照某些主题进行了聚合，而不是基于地名关系的概念本体论。主题可以是实体或概念，关系不受地名的限制。包含在用户兴趣中的概念相关性可以通过用相应的概念标注注意群集来捕获。
