##### Abstract
Robotic systems are complex and critical: they are inherently hybrid, combining both hardware and software; they typically exhibit both cyber-physical attributes and autonomous capabilities; and are required to be at least safe and often ethical. While for many engineered systems testing, either through real deployment or via simulation, is deemed sufficient the uniquely challenging elements of robotic systems, together with the crucial dependence on sophisticated software control and decision-making, requires a stronger form of verification. The increasing deployment of robotic systems in safety-critical scenarios exacerbates this still further and leads us towards the use of formal methods to ensure the correctness of, and provide sufficient evidence for the certification of, robotic systems. There have been many approaches that have used some variety of formal specification or formal verification in autonomous robotics, but there is no resource that collates this activity in to one place. This paper systematically surveys the state-of-the art in specification formalisms and tools for verifying robotic systems. Specifically, it describes the challenges arising from autonomy and software architectures, avoiding low-level hardware control and is subsequently identifies approaches for the specification and verification of robotic systems, while avoiding more general approaches.

机器人系统是复杂而关键的：它们本质上是混合的，结合了硬件和软件;它们通常表现出网络物理属性和自主能力;并且必须至少是安全的并且通常是道德的。虽然对于许多工程系统进行测试，无论是通过实际部署还是通过仿真，都被视为机器人系统中独特的挑战元素，以及对复杂软件控制和决策制定的重要依赖，需要更强大的验证形式。机器人系统在安全关键情况下的日益增加的部署进一步加剧了这种情况，并使我们使用正式方法来确保机器人系统的正确性并为其提供充分的证据。有许多方法在自动机器人中使用了各种形式规范或形式验证，但是没有资源将这种活动整理到一个地方。本文系统地研究了规范形式的最新技术和用于验证机器人系统的工具。具体而言，它描述了自治和软件架构带来的挑战，避免了低级硬件控制，随后确定了机器人系统规范和验证的方法，同时避免了更一般的方法。
