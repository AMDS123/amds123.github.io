##### Abstract
Automatically captioning images with natural language sentences is an important research topic. State of the art models are able to produce human-like sentences. These models typically describe the depicted scene as a whole and do not target specific objects of interest or emotional relationships between these objects in the image. However, marketing companies require to describe these important attributes of a given scene. In our case, objects of interest are consumer goods, which are usually identifiable by a product logo and are associated with certain brands. From a marketing point of view, it is desirable to also evaluate the emotional context of a trademarked product, i.e., whether it appears in a positive or a negative connotation. We address the problem of finding brands in images and deriving corresponding captions by introducing a modified image captioning network. We also add a third output modality, which simultaneously produces real-valued image ratings. Our network is trained using a classification-aware loss function in order to stimulate the generation of sentences with an emphasis on words identifying the brand of a product. We evaluate our model on a dataset of images depicting interactions between humans and branded products. The introduced network improves mean class accuracy by 24.5 percent. Thanks to adding the third output modality, it also considerably improves the quality of generated captions for images depicting branded products.

用自然语言自动标题图像是一个重要的研究课题。最先进的模型能够产生类人的句子。这些模型通常描述所描绘的场景作为一个整体，而不是针对图像中这些对象之间特定的兴趣对象或情感关系。但是，营销公司需要描述给定场景的这些重要属性。在我们的案例中，感兴趣的物品是消费品，通常可以通过产品标识进行识别，并与某些品牌相关联。从营销的角度来看，还需要评估商标产品的情感背景，即是否表现出正面或负面的含义。我们解决了在图像中查找品牌的问题，并通过引入修改的图像字幕网络来获取相应的字幕。我们还添加了第三种输出模式，同时产生实值图像评分。我们的网络使用分类感知损失函数进行训练，以激发句子的生成，强调识别产品品牌的词语。我们评估我们的模型在描绘人类和品牌产品之间的相互作用的图像数据集。引入的网络提高了24.5％的平均分类准确度。由于添加了第三种输出模式，它也显着提高了描绘品牌产品的图像的生成字幕的质量。
