##### Abstract
Automatically captioning images with natural language sentences is an important research topic. State of the art models are able to produce human-like sentences. These models typically describe the depicted scene as a whole and do not target specific objects of interest or emotional relationships between these objects in the image. However, marketing companies require to describe these important attributes of a given scene. In our case, objects of interest are consumer goods, which are usually identifiable by a product logo and are associated with certain brands. From a marketing point of view, it is desirable to also evaluate the emotional context of a trademarked product, i.e., whether it appears in a positive or a negative connotation. We address the problem of finding brands in images and deriving corresponding captions by introducing a modified image captioning network. We also add a third output modality, which simultaneously produces real-valued image ratings. Our network is trained using a classification-aware loss function in order to stimulate the generation of sentences with an emphasis on words identifying the brand of a product. We evaluate our model on a dataset of images depicting interactions between humans and branded products. The introduced network improves mean class accuracy by 24.5 percent. Thanks to adding the third output modality, it also considerably improves the quality of generated captions for images depicting branded products.

用自然语言句子自动标题图像是一个重要的研究课题。最先进的模型能够产生类似人类的句子。这些模型通常将所描绘的场景描述为整体，并且不针对图像中这些对象之间的特定感兴趣对象或情感关系。然而，营销公司需要描述给定场景的这些重要属性。在我们的案例中，感兴趣的对象是消费品，通常可以通过产品标识识别并与某些品牌相关联。从营销的观点来看，还希望还评估商标产品的情绪背景，即它是否以正面或负面的含义出现。我们通过引入修改后的图像字幕网络来解决在图像中查找品牌并获得相应字幕的问题。我们还添加了第三种输出模态，同时产生实值图像评级。我们的网络使用分类感知损失函数进行训练，以便刺激句子的生成，重点是识别产品品牌的单词。我们在描绘人类与品牌产品之间相互作用的图像数据集上评估我们的模型。引入的网络将平均类精度提高了24.5％。由于添加了第三种输出模式，它还大大提高了描绘品牌产品图像的生成标题的质量。
