##### Abstract
Automatic image captioning has recently approached human-level performance due to the latest advances in computer vision and natural language understanding. However, most of the current models can only generate plain factual descriptions about the content of a given image. However, for human beings, image caption writing is quite flexible and diverse, where additional language dimensions, such as emotion, humor and language styles, are often incorporated to produce diverse, emotional, or appealing captions. In particular, we are interested in generating sentiment-conveying image descriptions, which has received little attention. The main challenge is how to effectively inject sentiments into the generated captions without altering the semantic matching between the visual content and the generated descriptions. In this work, we propose two different models, which employ different schemes for injecting sentiments into image captions. Compared with the few existing approaches, the proposed models are much simpler and yet more effective. The experimental results show that our model outperform the state-of-the-art models in generating sentimental (i.e., sentiment-bearing) image captions. In addition, we can also easily manipulate the model by assigning different sentiments to the testing image to generate captions with the corresponding sentiments.

由于计算机视觉和自然语言理解的最新进展，自动图像字幕最近接近人类级别的表现。但是，大多数当前模型只能生成关于给定图像内容的简单事实描述。然而，对于人类而言，图像标题写作非常灵活和多样化，其中通常结合其他语言维度（例如情感，幽默和语言风格）来产生多样化，情感化或吸引人的字幕。特别是，我们感兴趣的是产生情感传达的图像描述，这种描述很少受到关注。主要挑战是如何在不改变可视内容和生成的描述之间的语义匹配的情况下有效地将情绪注入生成的字幕中。在这项工作中，我们提出了两种不同的模型，它们采用不同的方案将情绪注入图像标题。与现有的少数方法相比，所提出的模型更简单，更有效。实验结果表明，我们的模型在产生感性（即情感承载）图像标题方面优于最先进的模型。此外，我们还可以通过为测试图像分配不同的情绪来轻松操纵模型，以生成具有相应情绪的字幕。
