##### Abstract
Purpose To develop a computer based method for the automated assessment of image quality in the context of diabetic retinopathy (DR) to guide the photographer. Methods A deep learning framework was trained to grade the images automatically. A large representative set of 7000 color fundus images were used for the experiment which were obtained from the EyePACS that were made available by the California Healthcare Foundation. Three retinal image analysis experts were employed to categorize these images into Accept and Reject classes based on the precise definition of image quality in the context of DR. A deep learning framework was trained using 3428 images. Results A total of 3572 images were used for the evaluation of the proposed method. The method shows an accuracy of 100% to successfully categorise Accept and Reject images. Conclusion Image quality is an essential prerequisite for the grading of DR. In this paper we have proposed a deep learning based automated image quality assessment method in the context of DR. The method can be easily incorporated with the fundus image capturing system and thus can guide the photographer whether a recapture is necessary or not.

目的开发基于计算机的方法来自动评估糖尿病视网膜病变（DR）背景下的图像质量，以指导摄影师。方法训练深度学习框架，自动对图像进行分级。由加利福尼亚保健基金会提供的从EyePACS获得的大量具有代表性的7000色彩色眼底图像被用于实验。三名视网膜图像分析专家被用来将这些图像分类为“接受”和“拒绝”类别，这是基于DR背景下图像质量的精确定义。深度学习框架是使用3428图像进行训练的。结果共有3572张图像被用于评估所提出的方法。该方法显示100％的准确性，以成功地分类接受和拒绝图像。结论图像质量是DR分级的基本前提。在本文中，我们提出了一种基于深度学习的自动图像质量评估方法。该方法可以容易地与眼底图像捕获系统结合，从而可以引导摄影师是否需要重新捕获。
