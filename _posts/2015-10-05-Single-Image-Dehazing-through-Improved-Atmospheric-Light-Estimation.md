##### Abstract
Image contrast enhancement for outdoor vision is important for smart car auxiliary transport systems. The video frames captured in poor weather conditions are often characterized by poor visibility. Most image dehazing algorithms consider to use a hard threshold assumptions or user input to estimate atmospheric light. However, the brightest pixels sometimes are objects such as car lights or streetlights, especially for smart car auxiliary transport systems. Simply using a hard threshold may cause a wrong estimation. In this paper, we propose a single optimized image dehazing method that estimates atmospheric light efficiently and removes haze through the estimation of a semi-globally adaptive filter. The enhanced images are characterized with little noise and good exposure in dark regions. The textures and edges of the processed images are also enhanced significantly.

用于室外视觉的图像对比度增强对于智能汽车辅助运输系统是重要的在恶劣的天气条件下拍摄的视频帧通常具有较差的能见度。大多数图像去雾算法考虑使用硬阈值假设或用户输入来估计大气光。但是，最亮的像素有时是诸如汽车灯或路灯之类的物体，尤其是智能汽车辅助运输系统。简单地使用硬阈值可能会导致错误的估计。在本文中，我们提出了一种单一的优化图像去雾方法，通过估计一个半全局自适应滤波器来高效地估计大气光线并消除雾霾。增强图像的特点是在黑暗区域噪音小，曝光良好。处理图像的纹理和边缘也显着增强。
