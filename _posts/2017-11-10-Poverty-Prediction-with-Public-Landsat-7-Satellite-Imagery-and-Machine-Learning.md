##### Abstract
Obtaining detailed and reliable data about local economic livelihoods in developing countries is expensive, and data are consequently scarce. Previous work has shown that it is possible to measure local-level economic livelihoods using high-resolution satellite imagery. However, such imagery is relatively expensive to acquire, often not updated frequently, and is mainly available for recent years. We train CNN models on free and publicly available multispectral daytime satellite images of the African continent from the Landsat 7 satellite, which has collected imagery with global coverage for almost two decades. We show that despite these images' lower resolution, we can achieve accuracies that exceed previous benchmarks.

在发展中国家获得关于当地经济生计的详细和可靠的数据是昂贵的，因此数据是稀缺的。以前的工作表明，可以使用高分辨率的卫星图像来衡量地方经济生活。然而，这样的图像获取相对昂贵，往往不经常更新，并且主要是近年来可用的。我们利用Landsat 7卫星免费公开获取非洲大陆的多光谱白天卫星图像，收集了近二十年全球范围内的图像。我们表明，尽管这些图像的分辨率较低，我们可以达到超过以前基准的精度。
