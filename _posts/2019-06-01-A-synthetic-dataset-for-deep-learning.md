##### Abstract
In this paper, we propose a novel method for generating a synthetic dataset obeying Gaussian distribution. Compared to the commonly used benchmark datasets with unknown distribution, the synthetic dataset has an explicit distribution, i.e., Gaussian distribution. Meanwhile, it has the same characteristics as the benchmark dataset MNIST. As a result, we can easily apply Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) on the synthetic dataset. This synthetic dataset provides a novel experimental tool to verify the proposed theories of deep learning.
