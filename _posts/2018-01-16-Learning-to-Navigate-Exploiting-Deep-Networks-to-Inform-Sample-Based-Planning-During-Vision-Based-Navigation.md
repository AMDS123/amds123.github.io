##### Abstract
Recent applications of deep learning to navigation have generated end-to-end navigation solutions whereby visual sensor input is mapped to control signals or to motion primitives. The resulting visual navigation strategies work very well at collision avoidance and have performance that matches traditional reactive navigation algorithms while operating in real-time. It is accepted that these solutions cannot provide the same level of performance as a global planner. However, it is less clear how such end-to-end systems should be integrated into a full navigation pipeline. We evaluate the typical end-to-end solution within a full navigation pipeline in order to expose its weaknesses. Doing so illuminates how to better integrate deep learning methods into the navigation pipeline. In particular, we show that they are an efficient means to provide informed samples for sample-based planners. Controlled simulations with comparison against traditional planners show that the number of samples can be reduced by an order of magnitude while preserving navigation performance. Implementation on a mobile robot matches the simulated performance outcomes.

深度学习在导航领域的最近应用已经产生了端到端导航解决方案，由此视觉传感器输入被映射到控制信号或运动基元。由此产生的视觉导航策略在避免碰撞方面效果很好，并且在实时操作时具有与传统的反应式导航算法相匹配的性能。这些解决方案无法提供与全球规划师相同的性能，这是公认的。但是，如何将这种端到端系统整合到完整的导航管道中还不太清楚。我们在完整的导航管道中评估典型的端到端解决方案，以揭示其缺点。这样做说明了如何更好地将深度学习方法整合到导航管道中。特别是，我们表明，他们是一个有效的手段，为样本规划者提供知情的样本。通过与传统规划人员的对比仿真结果表明，在保持导航性能的同时，样本数量可以减少一个数量级。移动机器人的实现与模拟的性能结果相匹配。
