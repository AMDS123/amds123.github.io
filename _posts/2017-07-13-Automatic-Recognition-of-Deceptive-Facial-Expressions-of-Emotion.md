##### Abstract
Humans modify facial expressions in order to mislead observers regarding their true emotional states. Being able to recognize the authenticity of emotional displays is notoriously difficult for human observers. Evidence in experimental psychology shows that discriminative facial responses are short and subtle. This suggests that such behavior would be easier to distinguish when captured in high resolution at an increased frame rate. We are proposing SASE-FE, the first dataset of genuine and deceptive facial expressions of emotions for automatic recognition. We show that overall the problem of recognizing deceptive facial expressions can be successfully addressed by learning spatio-temporal representations of the data. For this purpose, we propose a method that aggregates features along fiducial trajectories in a deeply learnt feature space. Interesting additional results show that on average it is easier to distinguish among genuine expressions than deceptive ones and that certain emotion pairs are more difficult to distinguish than others.

人类修改面部表情是为了误导观察者的真实情绪状态。能够识别情感表现的真实性对于观察者是非常困难的。实验心理学的证据表明，有区别的面部反应是短暂而微妙的。这表明，当以高分辨率以更高的帧速率捕获时，这样的行为将更容易区分。我们正在提出SASE-FE，这是第一个真实和欺骗的情绪表情自动识别的数据集。我们表明，总体来说，识别欺骗性面部表情的问题可以通过学习数据的时空表示来成功解决。为此，我们提出了一种方法，在深度学习的特征空间中聚合沿着基准轨迹的特征。有趣的附加结果表明，平均而言，区分真正的表情比欺骗性的表情更容易，并且某些情感对比其他情况更难以区分。
