##### Abstract
Object detection is one of the most important challenges in computer vision. Object detectors are usually trained on bounding-boxes from still images. Recently, video has been used as an alternative source of data. Yet, for a given test domain (image or video), the performance of the detector depends on the domain it was trained on. In this paper, we examine the reasons behind this performance gap. We define and evaluate different domain shift factors: spatial location accuracy, appearance diversity, image quality and aspect distribution. We examine the impact of these factors by comparing performance before and after factoring them out. The results show that all four factors affect the performance of the detectors and their combined effect explains nearly the whole performance gap.

目标检测是计算机视觉中最重要的挑战之一。目标检测器通常在静止图像的边界框上进行训练。最近，视频已被用作数据的替代来源。然而，对于给定的测试领域（图像或视频），探测器的性能取决于它所训练的领域。在本文中，我们考察了这个性能差距背后的原因。我们定义和评估不同的域位移因素：空间位置精度，外观多样性，图像质量和方面分布。我们通过比较这些因素之前和之后的表现来检查这些因素的影响。结果表明，所有四个因素都影响探测器的性能，其综合效应几乎解释了整个性能差距。
