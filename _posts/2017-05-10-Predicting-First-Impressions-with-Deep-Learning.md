##### Abstract
Describable visual facial attributes are now commonplace in human biometrics and affective computing, with existing algorithms even reaching a sufficient point of maturity for placement into commercial products. These algorithms model objective facets of facial appearance, such as hair and eye color, expression, and aspects of the geometry of the face. A natural extension, which has not been studied to any great extent thus far, is the ability to model subjective attributes that are assigned to a face based purely on visual judgements. For instance, with just a glance, our first impression of a face may lead us to believe that a person is smart, worthy of our trust, and perhaps even our admiration - regardless of the underlying truth behind such attributes. Psychologists believe that these judgements are based on a variety of factors such as emotional states, personality traits, and other physiognomic cues. But work in this direction leads to an interesting question: how do we create models for problems where there is no ground truth, only measurable behavior? In this paper, we introduce a new convolutional neural network-based regression framework that allows us to train predictive models of crowd behavior for social attribute assignment. Over images from the AFLW face database, these models demonstrate strong correlations with human crowd ratings.

在人类生物识别和情感计算中，可描述的视觉面部属性现在是司空见惯的，现有的算法甚至达到了放置到商业产品中足够成熟的点。这些算法模拟面部外观的客观方面，诸如头发和眼睛颜色，表情以及面部几何形状的方面。到目前为止还没有深入研究过的一种自然延伸就是基于纯粹的视觉判断来建立分配给人脸的主观属性的能力。例如，只要一看，我们对面貌的第一印象就可能使我们相信，一个人是聪明的，值得我们信任的，甚至是我们的钦佩 - 不管这些属性背后的真相如何。心理学家认为，这些判断是基于各种因素，如情绪状态，性格特征和其他地理线索。但是朝这个方向努力会产生一个有趣的问题：我们如何在没有事实根据，只有可衡量的行为的情况下创造出问题的模型？在本文中，我们引入一个新的基于卷积神经网络的回归框架，使我们能够训练社会属性分配的人群行为预测模型。在来自AFLW人脸数据库的图像上，这些模型表现出与人群评分的强相关性。
