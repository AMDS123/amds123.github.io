##### Abstract
Autonomous warehouses with mobile, rack-carrying robots are starting to become commonplace, with systems such as Amazon's Kiva and Swisslog's CarryPick already implemented in functional warehouses. Such warehouses however still require human intervention for object picking and maintenance. In the European project SafeLog we are developing a safety-vest, used for safety-critical ranging and stopping of mobile robots, an improved planner that can handle large fleets of heterogeneous agents as well as an AR interaction system to navigate and support human workers in such automated environments. Here we present the AR interaction modalities, namely navigation, pick-by-AR and general system interactions that were developed at the moment of writing, as well as the overall system concept and planned future work.

带有移动式机架式机器人的自治仓库已经开始普及，亚马逊的Kiva和Swisslog的CarryPick等系统已经在功能性仓库中得到实施。然而，这样的仓库仍然需要人工干预才能进行物体采摘和维护。在欧洲的SafeLog项目中，我们正在开发一种安全背心，用于安全关键的测距和停止移动机器人，一种改进的规划器，可以处理大型异构代理队伍以及AR交互系统，以导航和支持人员这种自动化环境。在这里，我们将介绍在写作时开发的AR互动模式，即导航，选择AR和一般系统交互，以及整个系统概念和计划的未来工作。
