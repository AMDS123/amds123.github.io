##### Abstract
The pipelines of digital cameras contain a part for computational color constancy, which aims to remove the influence of the illumination on the scene colors. One of the best known and most widely used benchmark datasets for this problem is the Color Checker dataset. However, due to the improper handling of the black level in its images, this dataset has been widely misused and while some recent publications tried to alleviate the problem, they nevertheless erred and created additional wrong data. This paper gives a history of the Color Checker dataset usage, it describes the origins and reasons for its misuses, and it explains the old and new mistakes introduced in the most recent publications that tried to handle the issue. This should, hopefully, help to prevent similar future misuses.
