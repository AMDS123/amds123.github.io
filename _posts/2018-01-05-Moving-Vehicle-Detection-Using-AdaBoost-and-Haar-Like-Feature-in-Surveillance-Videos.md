##### Abstract
Vehicle detection is a technology which its aim is to locate and show the vehicle size in digital images. In this technology, vehicles are detected in presence of other things like trees and buildings. It has an important role in many computer vision applications such as vehicle tracking, analyzing the traffic scene and efficient traffic management. In this paper, vehicles detected based on the boosting technique by Viola Jones. Our proposed system is tested in some real scenes of surveillance videos with different light conditions. The experimental results show that the accuracy,completeness, and quality of the proposed vehicle detection method are better than the previous techniques (about 94%, 92%, and 87%, respectively). Thus, our proposed approach is robust and efficient to detect vehicles in surveillance videos and their applications.

车辆检测是一种技术，其目的是定位和显示数字图像的车辆大小。在这项技术中，车辆在树木和建筑物等其他物体的存在下被检测到。它在许多计算机视觉应用中起着重要的作用，如车辆跟踪，交通场景分析和高效的交通管理。在本文中，基于Viola Jones的助推技术检测车辆。我们提出的系统在不同光线条件下的监控视频真实场景中进行了测试。实验结果表明，所提出的车辆检测方法的准确性，完整性和质量优于先前的技术（分别为约94％，92％和87％）。因此，我们提出的方法在监视视频及其应用中检测车辆是稳健和高效的。
