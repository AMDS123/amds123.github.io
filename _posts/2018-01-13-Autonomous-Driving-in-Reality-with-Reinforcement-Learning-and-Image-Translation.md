##### Abstract
Supervised learning is widely used in training autonomous driving vehicle. However, it is trained with large amount of supervised labeled data. Reinforcement learning can be trained without abundant labeled data, but we cannot train it in reality because it would involve many unpredictable accidents. Nevertheless, training an agent with good performance in virtual environment is relatively much easier. Because of the huge difference between virtual and real, how to fill the gap between virtual and real is challenging. In this paper, we proposed a novel framework of reinforcement learning with image semantic segmentation network to make the whole model adaptable to reality. The agent is trained in TORCS, a car racing simulator.

监督学习广泛应用于自主驾驶车辆的培训。但是，它被训练了大量的监督标签数据。强化学习可以在没有丰富的标记数据的情况下进行训练，但是我们不能在现实中进行训练，因为这会涉及许多不可预知的事故。尽管如此，在虚拟环境中训练一个性能良好的代理相对要容易得多。由于虚拟和现实的巨大差异，如何填补虚拟和现实之间的差距是一个挑战。在本文中，我们提出了一个新的图像语义分割网络强化学习框架，使整个模型适应实际。代理商在赛车模拟器TORCS训练。
