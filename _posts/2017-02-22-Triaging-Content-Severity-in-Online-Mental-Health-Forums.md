##### Abstract
Mental health forums are online communities where people express their issues and seek help from moderators and other users. In such forums, there are often posts with severe content indicating that the user is in acute distress and there is a risk of attempted self-harm. Moderators need to respond to these severe posts in a timely manner to prevent potential self-harm. However, the large volume of daily posted content makes it difficult for the moderators to locate and respond to these critical posts. We present a framework for triaging user content into four severity categories which are defined based on indications of self-harm ideation. Our models are based on a feature-rich classification framework which includes lexical, psycholinguistic, contextual and topic modeling features. Our approaches improve the state of the art in triaging the content severity in mental health forums by large margins (up to 17% improvement over the F-1 scores). Using the proposed model, we analyze the mental state of users and we show that overall, long-term users of the forum demonstrate a decreased severity of risk over time. Our analysis on the interaction of the moderators with the users further indicates that without an automatic way to identify critical content, it is indeed challenging for the moderators to provide timely response to the users in need.

心理健康论坛是在线社区，人们在此表达自己的问题，并向版主和其他用户寻求帮助。在这样的论坛中，经常有帖子内容严重，说明用户处于严重困境，有自杀的危险。主持人需要及时应对这些严重的职位，以防止潜在的自我伤害。然而，大量的每日发布的内容使得主持人难以定位和响应这些关键职位。我们提出了一个用户内容分为四个严重性类别的框架，这些类别是基于自我伤害理念的指示而定义的。我们的模型基于功能丰富的分类框架，其中包括词汇，心理语言学，语境和主题建模功能。我们的方法改善了精神健康论坛的内容严重性（比F-1分数高出17％），从而大大改善了内容的严重性。使用所提出的模型，我们分析用户的心理状态，并显示论坛的总体长期用户表现出随着时间的推移风险降低。我们对调解员与用户互动的分析进一步表明，如果没有自动识别关键内容的方式，调解员对有需要的用户提供及时响应确实是一个挑战。
