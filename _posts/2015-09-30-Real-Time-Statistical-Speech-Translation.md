##### Abstract
This research investigates the Statistical Machine Translation approaches to translate speech in real time automatically. Such systems can be used in a pipeline with speech recognition and synthesis software in order to produce a real-time voice communication system between foreigners. We obtained three main data sets from spoken proceedings that represent three different types of human speech. TED, Europarl, and OPUS parallel text corpora were used as the basis for training of language models, for developmental tuning and testing of the translation system. We also conducted experiments involving part of speech tagging, compound splitting, linear language model interpolation, TrueCasing and morphosyntactic analysis. We evaluated the effects of variety of data preparations on the translation results using the BLEU, NIST, METEOR and TER metrics and tried to give answer which metric is most suitable for PL-EN language pair.

这项研究调查统计机器翻译方法实时翻译语音自动。这样的系统可以在具有语音识别和合成软件的管道中使用，以便在外国人之间产生实时的语音通信系统。我们从代表三种不同类型的人类言语的口头诉讼中获得了三个主要的数据集。 TED，Europarl和OPUS平行文本语料库被用作语言模型训练的基础，用于翻译系统的发展调整和测试。我们还进行了涉及词性标注，复合分割，线性语言模型插值，TrueCasing和形态句法分析的实验。我们使用BLEU，NIST，METEOR和TER度量标准评估了各种数据准备对翻译结果的影响，并试图给出答案，哪个度量标准最适合于PL-EN语言对。
