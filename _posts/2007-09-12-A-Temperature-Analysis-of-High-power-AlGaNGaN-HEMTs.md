##### Abstract
Galliumnitride has become a strategic superior material for space, defense and civil applications, primarily for power amplification at RF and mm-wave frequencies. For AlGaN/GaN high electron mobility transistors (HEMT), an outstanding performance combined together with low cost and high flexibility can be obtained using a System-in-a-Package (SIP) approach. Since thermal management is extremely important for these high power applications, a hybrid integration of the HEMT onto an AlN carrier substrate is proposed. In this study we investigate the temperature performance for AlGaN/GaN HEMTs integrated onto AlN using flip-chip mounting. Therefore, we use thermal simulations in combination with experimental results using micro-Raman spectroscopy and electrical dc-analysis.
