##### Abstract
We propose a method that integrates two widely available data sources, building footprints from 2D maps and street level images, to derive valuable information that is generally difficult to acquire -- building heights and building facade masks in images. Building footprints are elevated in world coordinates and projected onto images. Building heights are estimated by scoring projected footprints based on their alignment with building features in images. Building footprints with estimated heights can be converted to simple 3D building models, which are projected back to images to identify buildings. In this procedure, accurate camera projections are critical. However, camera position errors inherited from external sensors commonly exist, which adversely affect results. We derive a solution to precisely locate cameras on maps using correspondence between image features and building footprints. Experiments on real-world datasets show the promise of our method.

我们提出了一种方法，整合两个广泛可用的数据源，从2D地图和街道图像构建脚印，以获取通常难以获取的有价值的信息 - 构建高度并在图像中构建外观蒙版。建筑脚印在世界坐标上升高并投影到图像上。建筑物高度的估计方法是根据与建筑物图像的对齐情况对预测的足迹进行打分。建造具有估计高度的足迹可以转换成简单的3D建筑模型，这些建筑模型被投射回图像来识别建筑物。在这个过程中，准确的相机投影是关键。然而，从外部传感器继承的摄像机位置误差通常存在，这会对结果产生不利影响。我们推导出一种解决方案，使用图像特征与建筑物足迹之间的对应来精确定位地图上的相机。实际数据集上的实验表明了我们方法的前景。
