##### Abstract
Non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm II (NSGA-II) does well in dealing with multi-objective problems. When evaluating validity of an algorithm for multi-objective problems, two kinds of indices are often considered simultaneously, i.e. the convergence to Pareto Front and the distribution characteristic. The crowding distance in the standard NSGA-II has the property that solutions within a cubic have the same crowding distance, which has no contribution to the convergence of the algorithm. Actually the closer to the Pareto Front a solution is, the higher priority it should have. In the paper, the crowding distance is redefined while keeping almost all the advantages of the original one. Moreover, the speed of converging to the Pareto Front is faster. Finally, the improvement is proved to be effective by applying it to solve nine Benchmark problems.
