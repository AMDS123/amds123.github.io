##### Abstract
In this paper, we investigate the associative memory in recurrent neural networks, based on the model of evolving neural networks proposed by Nolfi, Miglino and Parisi. Experimentally developed network has highly asymmetric synaptic weights and dilute connections, quite different from those of the Hopfield model. Some results on the effect of learning efficiency on the evolution are also presented.

##### Abstract (translated by Google)
本文基于Nolfi，Miglino和Parisi提出的演化神经网络模型，研究了递归神经网络中的联想记忆。实验开发的网络具有高度不对称的突触权重和稀释连接，与Hopfield模型完全不同。还介绍了学习效率对进化的影响。
