##### Abstract
Security of robotics systems, as well as of the related middleware infrastructures, is a critical issue for industrial and domestic IoT, and it needs to be continuously assessed throughout the whole development lifecycle. The next generation open source robotic software stack, ROS2, is now targeting support for Secure DDS, providing the community with valuable tools for secure real world robotic deployments. In this work, we introduce a framework for procedural provisioning access control policies for robotic software, as well as for verifying the compliance of generated transport artifacts and decision point implementations.
