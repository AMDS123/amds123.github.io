##### Abstract
Recognition and identification of unknown targets is a crucial task in surveillance and security systems. Electronic Support Measures (ESM) are one of the most effective sensors for identification, especially for maritime and air--to--ground applications. In typical surveillance systems multiple ESM sensors are usually deployed along with kinematic sensors like radar. Different ESM sensors may produce different types of reports ready to be sent to the fusion center. The focus of this paper is to develop a new architecture for target recognition and identification when non--homogeneous ESM and possibly kinematic reports are received at the fusion center. The new fusion architecture is evaluated using simulations to show the benefit of utilizing different ESM reports such as attributes and signal level ESM data.

对未知目标的识别和识别是监视和安全系统中的关键任务。电子支持措施（ESM）是最有效的识别传感器之一，特别是海上和空对地应用。在典型的监视系统中，多个ESM传感器通常与雷达等运动传感器一起部署。不同的ESM传感器可能产生不同类型的报告，准备发送到融合中心。本文的重点是在融合中心收到非均匀ESM和可能的运动报告时，开发一种新的目标识别和识别结构。使用模拟来评估新的融合架构，以显示利用不同的ESM报告（例如属性和信号级ESM数据）的益处。
