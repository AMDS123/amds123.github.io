##### Abstract
The number of scientific papers grows exponentially in many disciplines. The share of online available papers grows as well. At the same time, the period of time for a paper to loose at chance to be cited anymore shortens. The decay of the citing rate shows similarity to ultradiffusional processes as for other online contents in social networks. The distribution of papers per author shows similarity to the distribution of posts per user in social networks. The rate of uncited papers for online available papers grows while some papers 'go viral' in terms of being cited. Summarized, the practice of scientific publishing moves towards the domain of social networks. The goal of this project is to create a text engineering tool, which can semi-automatically categorize a paper according to its type of contribution and extract relationships between them into an ontological database. Semi-automatic categorization means that the mistakes made by automatic pre-categorization and relationship-extraction will be corrected through a wikipedia-like front-end by volunteers from general public. This tool should not only help researchers and the general public to find relevant supplementary material and peers faster, but also provide more information for research funding agencies.

##### Abstract (translated by Google)
科学论文的数量在许多学科中呈指数级增长。在线可用论文的份额也在增长。与此同时，纸张再次被引用的时间也缩短了。与其他在线社交网络内容相比，引用率的衰退与超扩散过程相似。每位作者的论文分布与社交网络中每个用户的帖子分布相似。网上可用论文的不引用论文比率增长，而有些论文被引用的话则“病毒化”。总而言之，科学出版的实践走向了社会网络的范畴。这个项目的目标是创建一个文本工程工具，它可以根据贡献类型对文件进行半自动分类，并将它们之间的关系提取到本体数据库中。半自动分类意味着自动预分类和关系提取的错误将由公众志愿者通过类似维基百科的前端进行纠正。这个工具不仅可以帮助研究人员和普通大众更快地找到相关的辅助材料和同行，还可以为研究资助机构提供更多的信息。
