##### Abstract
Our understanding about things is conceptual. By stating that we reason about objects, it is in fact not the objects but concepts referring to them that we manipulate. Now, so long just as we acknowledge infinitely extending notions such as space, time, size, colour, etc, - in short, any reasonable quality - into which an object is subjected, it becomes infeasible to affirm atomicity in the concept referring to the object. However, formal/symbolic logics typically presume atomic entities upon which other expressions are built. Can we reflect our intuition about the concept onto formal/symbolic logics at all? I assure that we can, but the usual perspective about the atomicity needs inspected. In this work, I present gradual logic which materialises the observation that we cannot tell apart whether a so-regarded atomic entity is atomic or is just atomic enough not to be considered non-atomic. The motivation is to capture certain phenomena that naturally occur around concepts with attributes, including presupposition and contraries. I present logical particulars of the logic, which is then mapped onto formal semantics. Two linguistically interesting semantics will be considered. Decidability is shown.

##### Abstract (translated by Google)
我们对事物的理解是概念性的。通过陈述我们关于对象的理由，实际上不是对象，而是我们操纵的对象。现在，只要我们承认无限延伸的概念，如空间，时间，大小，颜色等等，简而言之，任何合理的质量，都是一个客体所受到的，在这个概念中确认原子性是不可行的。目的。然而，形式/符号逻辑通常假定构建其他表达式的原子实体。我们能否将我们关于概念的直觉反映到形式/符号逻辑上呢？我保证我们可以，但是关于原子性需求的一般观点是可以检查的。在这项工作中，我提出了逐渐的逻辑，这种逻辑实现了观察，即我们不能分辨出一个被认为是原子的实体是原子还是只是原子，而不被认为是非原子的。其动机是捕捉某些自然发生在具有属性的概念周围的现象，包括预设和对立。我介绍逻辑的逻辑细节，然后映射到形式语义。两个语言学上有趣的语义将被考虑。显示可判定性。
