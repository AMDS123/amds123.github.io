##### Abstract
The study of human genes and diseases is very rewarding and can lead to improvements in healthcare, disease diagnostics and drug discovery. In this paper, we further our previous study on gene disease relationship specifically with the multifunctional genes. We investigate the multifunctional gene disease relationship based on the published molecular function annotations of genes from the Gene Ontology which is the most comprehensive source on gene functions.
