##### Abstract
Although the attention on bipedal locomotion has increased over the last decades, robots are still far behind compared to human locomotor abilities. Their performance limitations can be partially attributed to the hardware, but the primary constrain has been the poor understanding of bipedal dynamics. Based on the recently developed model of potential energy for bipedal structures, this work proposes a task-space planner for human-like straight locomotion. The proposed architecture is based on potential energy model and employs locomotor strategies obtained from human data as a reference for optimal behaviour. The model generates CoM trajectory, foot swing trajectory and the base of support from the knowledge of the desired speed, initial posture, height, weight, number of steps and the angle between the foot and the ground during heel-strike. The data show that the proposed architecture can generate behaviour in line with human walking strategies for both the CoM and the foot swing. Although the planned trajectory is not smooth compared to human trajectories, the proposed model significantly reduces the error in the estimation of the CoM vertical trajectory. Moreover, being the planner able to generate a single stride in less than 140 ms and sequences of 10 strides in less than 600 ms, it allows an online task-space planning for locomotion. Lastly, the proposed architecture is also supported by analogies with current theories on human motor control of locomotion.

尽管在过去几十年中对双足运动的关注有所增加，但与人体运动能力相比，机器人仍远远落后。它们的性能限制可能部分归因于硬件，但主要的限制是对双足动力学的理解不足。基于最近开发的双足结构潜在能量模型，这项工作提出了一种类似人类直线运动的任务空间规划器。所提出的架构基于潜在的能量模型，并采用从人类数据获得的运动策略作为最佳行为的参考。该模型根据所需速度，初始姿势，高度，重量，步数以及脚跟着地期间脚与地面之间的角度的知识产生CoM轨迹，脚摆动轨迹和支撑基础。数据显示，所提出的架构可以产生符合CoM和脚摆的人行走策略的行为。尽管与人类轨迹相比，计划的轨迹不平滑，但是所提出的模型显着地减少了CoM垂直轨迹的估计误差。此外，作为能够在不到140毫秒内产生单步幅的计划者和在不到600毫秒内产生10步的序列，它允许用于运动的在线任务空间规划。最后，所提出的结构也得到了与人类运动控制运动的当前理论的类比的支持。
