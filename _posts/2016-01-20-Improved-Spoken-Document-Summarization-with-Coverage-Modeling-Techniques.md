##### Abstract
Extractive summarization aims at selecting a set of indicative sentences from a source document as a summary that can express the major theme of the document. A general consensus on extractive summarization is that both relevance and coverage are critical issues to address. The existing methods designed to model coverage can be characterized by either reducing redundancy or increasing diversity in the summary. Maximal margin relevance (MMR) is a widely-cited method since it takes both relevance and redundancy into account when generating a summary for a given document. In addition to MMR, there is only a dearth of research concentrating on reducing redundancy or increasing diversity for the spoken document summarization task, as far as we are aware. Motivated by these observations, two major contributions are presented in this paper. First, in contrast to MMR, which considers coverage by reducing redundancy, we propose two novel coverage-based methods, which directly increase diversity. With the proposed methods, a set of representative sentences, which not only are relevant to the given document but also cover most of the important sub-themes of the document, can be selected automatically. Second, we make a step forward to plug in several document/sentence representation methods into the proposed framework to further enhance the summarization performance. A series of empirical evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed methods.

摘要摘要旨在从源文件中选择一组指示性句子作为可以表达文件主题的摘要。关于抽取性总结的普遍共识是，相关性和覆盖面都是要解决的关键问题。设计覆盖范围的现有方法可以通过减少冗余或增加摘要中的多样性来表征。最大保证金相关性（MMR）是一个被广泛引用的方法，因为它在生成给定文档的摘要时考虑了相关性和冗余性。就MMR而言，据我们所知，只有一个研究集中在减少冗余或增加口头文档摘要任务的多样性方面。受到这些意见的启发，本文提出了两个主要贡献。首先，与通过减少冗余来考虑覆盖的MMR相比，我们提出了两种基于覆盖的新方法，其直接增加了多样性。使用所提出的方法，可以自动选择一组代表性的句子，它们不仅与给定的文件相关，而且涵盖文件的大部分重要的子主题，可以自动地选择。其次，为了进一步提高摘要性能，我们向文档/句子表示方法插入提出的框架。一系列经验性的评估证明了我们提出的方法的有效性。
