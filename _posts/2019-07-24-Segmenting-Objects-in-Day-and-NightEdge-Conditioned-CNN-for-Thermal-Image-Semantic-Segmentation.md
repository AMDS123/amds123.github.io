##### Abstract
Despite much research progress in image semantic segmentation, it remains challenging under adverse environmental conditions caused by imaging limitations of visible spectrum. While thermal infrared cameras have several advantages over cameras for the visible spectrum, such as operating in total darkness, insensitive to illumination variations, robust to shadow effects and strong ability to penetrate haze and smog. These advantages of thermal infrared cameras make the segmentation of semantic objects in day and night. In this paper, we propose a novel network architecture, called edge-conditioned convolutional neural network (EC-CNN), for thermal image semantic segmentation. Particularly, we elaborately design a gated feature-wise transform layer in EC-CNN to adaptively incorporate edge prior knowledge. The whole EC-CNN is end-to-end trained, and can generate high-quality segmentation results with the edge guidance. Meanwhile, we also introduce a new benchmark dataset named "Segment Objects in Day And night"(SODA) for comprehensive evaluations in thermal image semantic segmentation. SODA contains over 7,168 manually annotated and synthetically generated thermal images with 20 semantic region labels and from a broad range of viewpoints and scene complexities. Extensive experiments on SODA demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed EC-CNN against the state-of-the-art methods.
