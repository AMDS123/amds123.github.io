##### Abstract
In minimally invasive surgery, the use of tissue dissection tools causes smoke, which inevitably degrades the image quality. This could reduce the visibility of the operation field for surgeons and introduces errors for the computer vision algorithms used in surgical navigation systems. In this paper, we propose a novel approach for computational smoke removal using supervised image-to-image translation. We demonstrate that straightforward application of existing generative algorithms allows removing smoke but decreases image quality and introduces synthetic noise (grid-structure). Thus, we propose to solve this issue by modification of GAN's architecture and adding perceptual image quality metric to the loss function. Obtained results demonstrate that proposed method efficiently removes smoke as well as preserves perceptually sufficient image quality.
