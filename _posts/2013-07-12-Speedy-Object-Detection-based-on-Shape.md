##### Abstract
This study is a part of design of an audio system for in-house object detection system for visually impaired, low vision personnel by birth or by an accident or due to old age. The input of the system will be scene and output as audio. Alert facility is provided based on severity levels of the objects (snake, broke glass etc) and also during difficulties. The study proposed techniques to provide speedy detection of objects based on shapes and its scale. Features are extraction to have minimum spaces using dynamic scaling. From a scene, clusters of objects are formed based on the scale and shape. Searching is performed among the clusters initially based on the shape, scale, mean cluster value and index of object(s). The minimum operation to detect the possible shape of the object is performed. In case the object does not have a likely matching shape, scale etc, then the several operations required for an object detection will not perform; instead, it will declared as a new object. In such way, this study finds a speedy way of detecting objects.

本研究是为出生或意外或由于年老而为视障人士，低视力人员设计的内部对象检测系统音频系统的一部分。系统的输入将是场景并作为音频输出。警报设施根据物体（蛇，碎玻璃等）的严重程度以及困难情况提供。该研究提出了基于形状和尺度快速检测物体的技术。使用动态缩放功能提取的特征具有最小空间。从场景中，根据尺度和形状形成物体簇。搜索是在初始基于形状，尺度，平均聚类值和对象索引的簇之间进行的。执行检测物体可能形状的最小操作。如果对象没有可能匹配的形状，比例等，则对象检测所需的多个操作将不会执行;相反，它会声明为一个新的对象。通过这种方式，这项研究发现了一种快速的方法来检测对象。
