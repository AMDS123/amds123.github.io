##### Abstract
Various automobile and mobility companies, for instance, Ford, Uber, and Waymo, are currently testing their pre-produced autonomous vehicle (AV) fleets on the public roads. However, due to the rareness of the safety-critical cases and, effectively, unlimited number of possible traffic scenarios, these on-road testing efforts have been acknowledged as tedious, costly, and risky. In this study, we propose Accelerated Deployment framework to safely and efficiently estimate the AVs performance on public streets. We showed that by appropriately addressing the gradual accuracy improvement and adaptively selecting meaningful and safe environment under which the AV is deployed, the proposed framework yield to highly accurate estimation with much faster evaluation time, and more importantly, lower deployment risk. Our findings provide an answer to the currently heated and active discussions on how to properly test AV performance on public roads so as to achieve safe, efficient, and statistically-reliable testing framework for AV technologies.

例如，福特，优步和Waymo等各种汽车和移动公司目前正在公共道路上测试其预生产的自主车辆（AV）车队。然而，由于安全危急情况的罕见情况，并且实际上可能的交通场景数量不受限制，因此这些路上测试工作已被认为是乏味，昂贵且具有风险。在这项研究中，我们提出了加速部署框架，以安全和有效地评估公共街道上的AVs性能。我们表明，通过适当解决渐进的准确度改进和自适应选择有效和安全的AV环境，所提出的框架能够以更快的评估时间进行高度准确的评估，更重要的是降低部署风险。我们的研究结果为如何在公共道路上正确测试AV性能以获得安全，高效和统计可靠的AV技术测试框架提供了一个答案。
