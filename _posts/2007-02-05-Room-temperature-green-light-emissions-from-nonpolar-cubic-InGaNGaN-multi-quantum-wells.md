##### Abstract
Cubic InGaN/GaN multi quantum wells (MQWs) with high structural and optical quality are achieved by utilizing free-standing 3C-SiC (001) substrates and optimizing InGaN quantum well growth. Superlattice peaks up to 5th order are clearly resolved in X-ray diffraction. We observe bright green room temperature photoluminescence (PL) from c-InxGa1-xN/GaN MQWs (x=0.16). The full-width at half maximum of the PL emission is about 240 meV at 300 K. The PL intensity increases with well thickness, giving proof that polarization fields which can limit the performance of the wurtzite III-nitride based devices are absent. The diffusion length of excess carriers is about 17 nm.
