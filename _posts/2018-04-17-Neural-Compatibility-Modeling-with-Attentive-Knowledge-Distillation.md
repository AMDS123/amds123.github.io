##### Abstract
Recently, the booming fashion sector and its huge potential benefits have attracted tremendous attention from many research communities. In particular, increasing research efforts have been dedicated to the complementary clothing matching as matching clothes to make a suitable outfit has become a daily headache for many people, especially those who do not have the sense of aesthetics. Thanks to the remarkable success of neural networks in various applications such as image classification and speech recognition, the researchers are enabled to adopt the data-driven learning methods to analyze fashion items. Nevertheless, existing studies overlook the rich valuable knowledge (rules) accumulated in fashion domain, especially the rules regarding clothing matching. Towards this end, in this work, we shed light on complementary clothing matching by integrating the advanced deep neural networks and the rich fashion domain knowledge. Considering that the rules can be fuzzy and different rules may have different confidence levels to different samples, we present a neural compatibility modeling scheme with attentive knowledge distillation based on the teacher-student network scheme. Extensive experiments on the real-world dataset show the superiority of our model over several state-of-the-art baselines. Based upon the comparisons, we observe certain fashion insights that add value to the fashion matching study. As a byproduct, we released the codes, and involved parameters to benefit other researchers.

最近，蓬勃发展的时尚界及其巨大的潜在利益已经引起了许多研究团体的极大关注。特别是，越来越多的研究工作致力于将匹配服装作为配套服装进行配套服装匹配，这已经成为许多人日常头痛的问题，尤其是那些没有美感的人。由于神经网络在图像分类和语音识别等各种应用中取得了显着的成功，研究人员能够采用数据驱动的学习方法来分析时尚物品。尽管如此，现有的研究忽略了时尚领域积累的丰富的宝贵知识（规则），特别是关于服装搭配的规则。为此，在这项工作中，我们通过整合先进的深度神经网络和丰富的时尚领域知识来阐明辅助服装匹配。考虑到规则可能是模糊的，不同的规则可能对不同的样本具有不同的置信度，我们提出了一种基于师生网络方案的神经兼容性建模方案，其中注意到了知识蒸馏。对现实世界的数据集进行的大量实验表明，我们的模型优于几个最先进的基线。根据比较，我们观察到某些时尚见解为时尚搭配研究增添了价值。作为副产品，我们发布了代码，并涉及参数以使其他研究人员受益。
