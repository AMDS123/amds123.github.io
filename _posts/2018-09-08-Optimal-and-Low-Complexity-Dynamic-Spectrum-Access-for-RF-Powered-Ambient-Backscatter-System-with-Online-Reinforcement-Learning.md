##### Abstract
Ambient backscatter has been introduced with a wide range of applications for low power wireless communications. In this article, we propose an optimal and low-complexity dynamic spectrum access framework for RF-powered ambient backscatter system. In this system, the secondary transmitter not only harvests energy from ambient signals (from incumbent users), but also backscatters these signals to its receiver for data transmission. Under the dynamics of the ambient signals, we first adopt the Markov decision process (MDP) framework to obtain the optimal policy for the secondary transmitter, aiming to maximize the system throughput. However, the MDP-based optimization requires complete knowledge of environment parameters, e.g., the probability of a channel to be idle and the probability of a successful packet transmission, that may not be practical to obtain. To cope with such incomplete knowledge of the environment, we develop a low-complexity online reinforcement learning algorithm that allows the secondary transmitter to "learn" from its decisions and then attain the optimal policy. Simulation results show that the proposed learning algorithm not only efficiently deals with the dynamics of the environment, but also improves the average throughput up to 50% and reduces the blocking probability and delay up to 80% compared with conventional methods.

环境背向散射已被引入，具有用于低功率无线通信的广泛应用。在本文中，我们为射频供电的环境后向散射系统提出了一种最优，低复杂度的动态频谱接入框架。在该系统中，辅助发射器不仅从环境信号（来自现有用户）收集能量，而且还将这些信号反向散射到其接收器以进行数据传输。在环境信号的动态下，我们首先采用马尔可夫决策过程（MDP）框架来获得二次发射机的最优策略，旨在最大化系统吞吐量。然而，基于MDP的优化需要完全了解环境参数，例如，信道空闲的概率和成功的分组传输的概率，这可能是不实际获得的。为了应对这种不完整的环境知识，我们开发了一种低复杂度的在线强化学习算法，允许辅助发射机从其决策中“学习”，然后获得最优策略。仿真结果表明，与传统方法相比，所提出的学习算法不仅可以有效地处理环境动态，而且可以将平均吞吐量提高50％，并将阻塞概率和延迟降低80％。
