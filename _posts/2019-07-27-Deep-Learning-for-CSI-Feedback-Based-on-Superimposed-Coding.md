##### Abstract
Massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) with frequency division duplex (FDD) mode is a promising approach to increasing system capacity and link robustness for the fifth generation (5G) wireless cellular systems. The premise of these advantages is the accurate downlink channel state information (CSI) fed back from user equipment. However, conventional feedback methods have difficulties in reducing feedback overhead due to significant amount of base station (BS) antennas in massive MIMO systems. Recently, deep learning (DL)-based CSI feedback conquers many difficulties, yet still shows insufficiency to decrease the occupation of uplink bandwidth resources. In this paper, to solve this issue, we combine DL and superimposed coding (SC) for CSI feedback, in which the downlink CSI is spread and then superimposed on uplink user data sequences (UL-US) toward the BS. Then, a multi-task neural network (NN) architecture is proposed at BS to recover the downlink CSI and UL-US by unfolding two iterations of the minimum mean-squared error (MMSE) criterion-based interference reduction. In addition, for a network training, a subnet-by-subnet approach is exploited to facilitate the parameter tuning and expedite the convergence rate. Compared with standalone SC-based CSI scheme, our multi-task NN, trained in a specific signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and power proportional coefficient (PPC), consistently improves the estimation of downlink CSI with similar or better UL-US detection under SNR and PPC varying.
