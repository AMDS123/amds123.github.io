##### Abstract
In earlier work, we have shown that articulation rate in Swedish child-directed speech (CDS) increases as a function of the age of the child, even when utterance length and differences in articulation rate between subjects are controlled for. In this paper we show on utterance level in spontaneous Swedish speech that i) for the youngest children, articulation rate in CDS is lower than in adult-directed speech (ADS), ii) there is a significant negative correlation between articulation rate and surprisal (the negative log probability) in ADS, and iii) the increase in articulation rate in Swedish CDS as a function of the age of the child holds, even when surprisal along with utterance length and differences in articulation rate between speakers are controlled for. These results indicate that adults adjust their articulation rate to make it fit the linguistic capacity of the child.

在早期的工作中，我们已经表明瑞典儿童导向语言（CDS）的发音率随着儿童年龄的增加而增加，即使话语长度和主语之间发音率的差异得到控制。在本文中，我们在自发的瑞典语演讲中表现了以下几种情况：i）对于最年幼的儿童，CDS中的发音率低于成人指导语音（ADS）; ii）发音率与意外负面的对数概率），以及iii）瑞典CDS的发音率随着孩子年龄的增长而增加，即使在发音长度和发音人之间的发音速率差异都出乎意料的情况下也是如此。这些结果表明，成年人调整他们的发音率，使其符合儿童的语言能力。
