##### Abstract
Image identification is one of the most challenging tasks in different areas of computer vision. Scale-invariant feature transform is an algorithm to detect and describe local features in images to further use them as an image matching criteria. In this paper, the performance of the SIFT matching algorithm against various image distortions such as rotation, scaling, fisheye and motion distortion are evaluated and false and true positive rates for a large number of image pairs are calculated and presented. We also evaluate the distribution of the matched keypoint orientation difference for each image deformation.

图像识别是计算机视觉不同领域中最具挑战性的任务之一。尺度不变特征变换是一种检测和描述图像局部特征的算法，以进一步将其用作图像匹配标准。本文研究了SIFT匹配算法对旋转，缩放，鱼眼和运动失真等各种图像失真的性能，并计算并提出了大量图像对的假阳性率。我们还评估每个图像变形匹配关键点方向差异的分布。
