##### Abstract
Ensuring flexible and efficient manufacturing of customized products in an increasing dynamic and turbulent environment without sacrificing cost effectiveness, product quality and on-time delivery has become a key issue for most industrial enterprises. A promising approach to cope with this challenge is the integration of cognitive capabilities in systems and processes with the aim of expanding the knowledge base used to perform managerial and operational tasks. In this work, a novel approach to real-time rescheduling is proposed in order to achieve sustainable improvements in flexibility and adaptability of production systems through the integration of artificial cognitive capabilities, involving perception, reasoning/learning and planning skills. Moreover, an industrial example is discussed where the SOAR cognitive architecture capabilities are integrated in a software prototype, showing that the approach enables the rescheduling system to respond to events in an autonomic way, and to acquire experience through intensive simulation while performing repair tasks.

在不牺牲成本效益，产品质量和按时交货的情况下，确保在日益动态和动荡的环境中灵活高效地制造定制产品已成为大多数工业企业的关键问题。应对这一挑战的一个有希望的方法是将认知能力整合到系统和流程中，目的是扩展用于执行管理和运营任务的知识库。在这项工作中，提出了一种实时重新安排的新方法，通过整合人工认知能力，包括感知，推理/学习和规划技能，实现生产系统的灵活性和适应性的可持续改进。此外，还讨论了一个工业示例，其中将SOAR认知架构功能集成到软件原型中，表明该方法使重新调度系统能够以自主方式响应事件，并在执行修复任务时通过强化仿真获取经验。
