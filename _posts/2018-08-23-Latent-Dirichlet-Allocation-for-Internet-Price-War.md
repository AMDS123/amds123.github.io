##### Abstract
Internet market makers are always facing intense competitive environment, where personalized price reductions or discounted coupons are provided for attracting more customers. Participants in such a price war scenario have to invest a lot to catch up with other competitors. However, such a huge cost of money may not always lead to an improvement of market share. This is mainly due to a lack of information about others' strategies or customers' willingness when participants develop their strategies. 
 In order to obtain this hidden information through observable data, we study the relationship between companies and customers in the Internet price war. Theoretically, we provide a formalization of the problem as a stochastic game with imperfect and incomplete information. Then we develop a variant of Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) to infer latent variables under the current market environment, which represents the preferences of customers and strategies of competitors. To our best knowledge, it is the first time that LDA is applied to game scenario. 
 We conduct simulated experiments where our LDA model exhibits a significant improvement on finding strategies in the Internet price war by including all available market information of the market maker's competitors. And the model is applied to an open dataset for real business. Through comparisons on the likelihood of prediction for users' behavior and distribution distance between inferred opponent's strategy and the real one, our model is shown to be able to provide a better understanding for the market environment. 
 Our work marks a successful learning method to infer latent information in the environment of price war by the LDA modeling, and sets an example for related competitive applications to follow.

##### Abstract (translated by Google)
互联网市场制造商总是面临激烈的竞争环境，其中提供个性化降价或折扣优惠券以吸引更多客户。这种价格战情景的参与者必须投入大量资金才能赶上其他竞争对手。然而，如此巨大的资金成本并不总能带来市场份额的提升。这主要是由于在参与者制定策略时缺乏关于他人策略或客户意愿的信息。
 为了通过可观察的数据获取这些隐藏的信息，我们研究了互联网价格战中公司与客户之间的关系。从理论上讲，我们将问题形式化为具有不完全和不完整信息的随机博弈。然后我们开发了潜在Dirichlet分配（LDA）的变体来推断当前市场环境下的潜在变量，它代表了客户的偏好和竞争对手的策略。据我们所知，这是LDA首次应用于游戏场景。
 我们进行了模拟实验，其中我们的LDA模型通过包含做市商竞争对手的所有可用市场信息，在寻找互联网价格战策略方面取得了显着进步。该模型应用于实际业务的开放数据集。通过比较预测用户行为和推断对手战略与真实战略之间的分布距离的可能性，我们的模型被证明能够更好地理解市场环境。
 我们的工作标志着一种成功的学习方法，通过LDA建模来推断价格战环境中的潜在信息，并为相关的竞争应用树立了一个榜样。
