##### Abstract
As the use of technology increases and data analysis becomes integral in many businesses, the ability to quickly access and interpret data has become more important than ever. Information retrieval technologies are being utilized by organizations and companies to manage their information systems and processes. Despite information retrieval of a large amount of data being efficient organized in relational databases, a user still needs to master the DB language/schema to completely formulate the queries. This puts a burden on organizations and companies to hire employees that are proficient in DB languages/schemas to formulate queries. To reduce some of the burden on already overstretched data teams, many organizations are looking for tools that allow non-developers to query their databases. Unfortunately, writing a valid SQL query that answers the question a user is trying to ask isn't always easy. Even seemingly simple questions, like "Which start-up companies received more than $200M in funding?" can actually be very hard to answer, let alone convert into a SQL query. How do you define start-up companies? By size, location, duration of time they have been incorporated? This may be fine if a user is working with a database they're already familiar with, but what if users are not familiar with the database. What is needed is a centralized system that can effectively translate natural language queries into specific database queries for different customer database types. There is a number of factors that can dramatically affect the system architecture and the set of algorithms used to translate NL queries into a structured query representation.

随着技术的使用不断增加，数据分析成为许多企业不可或缺的一部分，快速访问和解释数据的能力变得前所未有的重要。组织和公司正在利用信息检索技术来管理其信息系统和流程。尽管在关系数据库中有效地组织了大量数据的信息检索，但用户仍然需要掌握DB语言/模式以完全形成查询。这给组织和公司带来了负担，即雇用精通数据库语言/模式的员工来制定查询。为了减轻已经过度紧张的数据团队的一些负担，许多组织正在寻找允许非开发人员查询其数据库的工具。不幸的是，编写一个有效的SQL查询来回答用户试图提出的问题并不容易。即使是看似简单的问题，比如“哪家初创公司的资金超过2亿美元？”实际上很难回答，更不用说转换成SQL查询了。你如何定义初创公司？根据它们的大小，位置，持续时间而定？如果用户正在使用他们已经熟悉的数据库，这可能没问题，但如果用户不熟悉数据库会怎样。所需要的是一种集中式系统，它可以有效地将自然语言查询转换为针对不同客户数据库类型的特定数据库查询有许多因素可以显着影响系统体系结构和用于将NL查询转换为结构化查询表示的算法集。
