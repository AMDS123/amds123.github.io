##### Abstract
Recent research shows that most Brazilian students have serious problems regarding their reading skills. The full development of this skill is key for the academic and professional future of every citizen. Tools for classifying the complexity of reading materials for children aim to improve the quality of the model of teaching reading and text comprehension. For English, Fengs work [11] is considered the state-of-art in grade level prediction and achieved 74% of accuracy in automatically classifying 4 levels of textual complexity for close school grades. There are no classifiers for nonfiction texts for close grades in Portuguese. In this article, we propose a scheme for manual annotation of texts in 5 grade levels, which will be used for customized reading to avoid the lack of interest by students who are more advanced in reading and the blocking of those that still need to make further progress. We obtained 52% of accuracy in classifying texts into 5 levels and 74% in 3 levels. The results prove to be promising when compared to the state-of-art work.9

最近的研究表明，大多数巴西学生在阅读技巧方面存在严重的问题。这个技能的全面发展对每个公民的学术和职业的未来都是至关重要的。对儿童阅读材料的复杂性进行分类的工具旨在提高阅读教学和文本理解模式的质量。对于英语而言，Fengs的作品[11]被认为是年级预测的先进技术，在自动分类4个级别的文本复杂度时，准确率达到了74％。在葡萄牙语中，没有关于非正式文字的分类。在这篇文章中，我们提出了一个5级文本的人工注释方案，这个方案将被用于定制阅读，以避免阅读更加高级的学生缺乏兴趣，阻止那些仍然需要进一步学习的学生进展。我们在文本分类的5个级别中获得了52％的准确性，在3个级别中获得了74％的准确性。与最先进的工作相比，结果证明是有希望的
