##### Abstract
In this paper, we propose a method of human activity recognition with high throughput from raw accelerometer data applying a deep recurrent neural network (DRNN), and investigate various architectures and its combination to find the best parameter values. The "high throughput" refers to short time at a time of recognition. We investigated various parameters and architectures of the DRNN by using the training dataset of 432 trials with 6 activity classes from 7 people. The maximum recognition rate was 95.42% and 83.43% against the test data of 108 segmented trials each of which has single activity class and 18 multiple sequential trials, respectively. Here, the maximum recognition rates by traditional methods were 71.65% and 54.97% for each. In addition, the efficiency of the found parameters was evaluated by using additional dataset. Further, as for throughput of the recognition per unit time, the constructed DRNN was requiring only 1.347 [ms], while the best traditional method required 11.031 [ms] which includes 11.027 [ms] for feature calculation. These advantages are caused by the compact and small architecture of the constructed real time oriented DRNN.

在本文中，我们提出了一种应用深回归神经网络（DRNN）的原始加速度计数据的高吞吐量的人类活动识别方法，并研究了各种体系结构及其组合以找到最佳参数值。 “高吞吐量”是指在识别时间短的时间。我们通过使用来自7个人的6个活动类的432个试验的训练数据集来研究DRNN的各种参数和体系结构。最大识别率分别为95.42％和83.43％，其中108个分段试验分别具有单个活动等级和18个多重连续试验。在这里，传统方法的最高识别率分别为71.65％和54.97％。另外，通过使用附加数据集来评估所找到的参数的效率。此外，对于每单位时间识别的吞吐量，所构建的DRNN仅需要1.347 [ms]，而最佳的传统方法需要11.031 [ms]，其包括11.027 [ms]用于特征计算。这些优点是由构建的实时定向DRNN的紧凑小型架构引起的。
