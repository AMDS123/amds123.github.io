##### Abstract
Face detection has witnessed immense progress in the last few years, with new milestones being surpassed every year. While many challenges such as large variations in scale, pose, appearance are successfully addressed, there still exist several issues which are not specifically captured by existing methods or datasets. In this work, we identify the next set of challenges that requires attention from the research community and collect a new dataset of face images that involve these issues such as weather-based degradations, motion blur, focus blur and several others. We demonstrate that there is a considerable gap in the performance of state-of-the-art detectors and real-world requirements. Hence, in an attempt to fuel further research in unconstrained face detection, we present a new annotated Unconstrained Face Detection Dataset (UFDD) with several challenges and benchmark recent methods. Additionally, we provide an in-depth analysis of the results and failure cases of these methods. The dataset as well as baseline results will be made publicly available in due time. The UFDD dataset as well as baseline results are available at: www.ufdd.info/

##### Abstract (translated by Google)
面部检测在过去几年中取得了巨大进步，每年都有新的里程碑被超越。虽然成功解决了诸如规模，姿势，外观的大变化等许多挑战，但仍存在若干问题，这些问题未被现有方法或数据集特别捕获。在这项工作中，我们确定了需要研究界关注的下一组挑战，并收集涉及这些问题的新面部图像数据集，如基于天气的降级，运动模糊，焦点模糊等。我们证明了最先进的探测器和现实要求的性能存在相当大的差距。因此，为了推动无约束人脸检测的进一步研究，我们提出了一个新的注释无约束人脸检测数据集（UFDD），其中包含一些挑战和基准近期方法。此外，我们还对这些方法的结果和失败案例进行了深入分析。数据集以及基线结果将在适当的时候公开发布。 UFDD数据集以及基线结果可在以下网址获得：www.ufdd.info/
