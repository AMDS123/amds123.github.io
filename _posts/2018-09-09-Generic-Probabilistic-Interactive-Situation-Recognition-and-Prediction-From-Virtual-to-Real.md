##### Abstract
Accurate and robust recognition and prediction of traffic situation plays an important role in autonomous driving, which is a prerequisite for risk assessment and effective decision making. Although there exist a lot of works dealing with modeling driver behavior of a single object, it remains a challenge to make predictions for multiple highly interactive agents that react to each other simultaneously. In this work, we propose a generic probabilistic hierarchical recognition and prediction framework which employs a two-layer Hidden Markov Model (TLHMM) to obtain the distribution of potential situations and a learning-based dynamic scene evolution model to sample a group of future trajectories. Instead of predicting motions of a single entity, we propose to get the joint distribution by modeling multiple interactive agents as a whole system. Moreover, due to the decoupling property of the layered structure, our model is suitable for knowledge transfer from simulation to real world applications as well as among different traffic scenarios, which can reduce the computational efforts of training and the demand for a large data amount. A case study of highway ramp merging scenario is demonstrated to verify the effectiveness and accuracy of the proposed framework.

准确而有力的交通状况识别和预测在自动驾驶中起着重要作用，这是风险评估和有效决策的先决条件。尽管存在许多处理单个对象的建模驱动程序行为的工作，但是对于同时对彼此作出反应的多个高度交互的代理进行预测仍然是一个挑战。在这项工作中，我们提出了一个通用的概率分层识别和预测框架，它采用两层隐马尔可夫模型（TLHMM）来获得潜在情况的分布，并采用基于学习的动态场景演化模型来对一组未来轨迹进行采样。我们建议通过将多个交互式代理建模为整个系统来获得联合分布，而不是预测单个实体的运动。此外，由于分层结构的解耦特性，我们的模型适用于从模拟到现实应用以及不同交通场景之间的知识转移，这可以减少训练的计算量和对大量数据的需求。对公路坡道合并情景的案例研究进行了验证，以验证拟议框架的有效性和准确性。
