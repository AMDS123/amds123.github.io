##### Abstract
The intelligent vehicle community has devoted considerable efforts to model driver behavior, and in particular to detect and overcome driver distraction in an effort to reduce accidents caused by driver negligence. However, as the domain increasingly shifts towards autonomous and semi-autonomous solutions, the driver is no longer integral to the decision making process, indicating a need to refocus efforts elsewhere. To this end, we propose to study pedestrian distraction instead. In particular, we focus on detecting pedestrians who are engaged in secondary activities involving their cellphones and similar handheld multimedia devices from a purely vision-based standpoint. To achieve this objective, we propose a pipeline incorporating articulated human pose estimation, followed by a soft object label transfer from an ensemble of exemplar SVMs trained on the nearest neighbors in pose feature space. We additionally incorporate head gaze features and prior pose information to carry out cellphone related pedestrian activity recognition. Finally, we offer a method to reliably track the articulated pose of a pedestrian through a sequence of images using a particle filter with a Gaussian Process Dynamical Model (GPDM), which can then be used to estimate sequentially varying activity scores at a very low computational cost. The entire framework is fast (especially for sequential data) and accurate, and easily extensible to include other secondary activities and sources of distraction.

智能汽车社区致力于对驾驶员行为进行建模，特别是检测和克服驾驶员分心，努力减少驾驶员疏忽造成的事故。然而，随着领域日益转向自主和半自主的解决方案，司机不再是决策过程的组成部分，表明需要重新调整其他地方的工作。为此，我们建议研究分散行人的注意力。特别是，我们专注于从纯粹的视觉角度来检测从事涉及手机和类似手持多媒体设备的次要活动的行人。为了达到这个目的，我们提出了一种结合了人类关节姿态估计的流水线，然后在姿态特征空间中训练最近邻居的示例性支持向量机的集合中进行软对象标签转移。我们另外加入头部注视特征和先前的姿态信息来执行与手机相关的行人活动识别。最后，我们提供了一种方法，通过使用带有高斯过程动力学模型（GPDM）的粒子滤波器，通过一系列图像可靠地跟踪行人的关节姿态，然后可以用非常低的计算来估计顺序变化的活动分数成本。整个框架是快速的（特别是对于顺序数据）和准确的，并且容易扩展以包括其他次要活动和分心源。
