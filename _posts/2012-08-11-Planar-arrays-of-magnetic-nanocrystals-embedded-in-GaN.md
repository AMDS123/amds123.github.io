##### Abstract
Single planar arrays of Ga(x)Fe(4-x)N magnetic nanocrystals embedded in GaN have been fabricated in an epitaxial process. The phase of the nanocrystals and their epitaxial relationship with the host matrix are studied $via$ high-resolution transmission electron microscopy and high-resolution x-ray diffraction. By changing the growth parameters and mode, the crystallographic phase and chemical composition of the nanocrystals can be varied on demand. In view of the different magnetic properties of the various phases, applications in room-temperature ferromagnetic as well as antiferromagnetic spintronic devices are envisaged.
