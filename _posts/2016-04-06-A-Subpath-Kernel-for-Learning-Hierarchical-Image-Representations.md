##### Abstract
Tree kernels have demonstrated their ability to deal with hierarchical data, as the intrinsic tree structure often plays a discriminative role. While such kernels have been successfully applied to various domains such as nature language processing and bioinformatics, they mostly concentrate on ordered trees and whose nodes are described by symbolic data. Meanwhile, hierarchical representations have gained increasing interest to describe image content. This is particularly true in remote sensing, where such representations allow for revealing different objects of interest at various scales through a tree structure. However, the induced trees are unordered and the nodes are equipped with numerical features. In this paper, we propose a new structured kernel for hierarchical image representations which is built on the concept of subpath kernel. Experimental results on both artificial and remote sensing datasets show that the proposed kernel manages to deal with the hierarchical nature of the data, leading to better classification rates.

##### Abstract (translated by Google)
树核已经证明了它们处理分层数据的能力，因为内在树结构通常起着区别作用。虽然这样的内核已经成功应用于自然语言处理和生物信息学等各个领域，但是它们大多集中在有序树上，而其节点是由符号数据描述的。同时，分层表示越来越感兴趣地描述图像内容。在遥感中尤其如此，这种表示允许通过树结构在各种尺度上揭示不同的兴趣对象。然而，诱导树是无序的，并且节点具有数字特征。在本文中，我们提出了一个基于子路径内核概念的分层图像表示的新结构化内核。在人造和遥感数据集上的实验结果表明，所提出的核心设法处理数据的分层性质，导致更好的分类率。
