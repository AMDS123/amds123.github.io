##### Abstract
Banking Trojans, botnets are primary drivers of financially-motivated cybercrime. In this paper, we first analyzed how an APT-based banking botnet works step by step through the whole lifecycle. Specifically, we present a multi-stage system that detects malicious banking botnet activities which potentially target the organizations. The system leverages Cyber Data Lake as well as multiple artificial intelligence techniques at different stages. The evaluation results using public datasets showed that Deep Learning based detections were highly successful compared with baseline models. The proposed detections are partially in production on Cyber Data Lake within the organization, and we are continuing to work with internal security teams on further operational challenges.
