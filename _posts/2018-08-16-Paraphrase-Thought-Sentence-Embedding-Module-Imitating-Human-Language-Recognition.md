##### Abstract
Sentence embedding is an important research topic in natural language processing. It is essential to generate a good embedding vector that fully reflects the semantic meaning of a sentence in order to achieve an enhanced performance for various natural language processing tasks, such as machine translation and document classification. Thus far, various sentence embedding models have been proposed, and their feasibility has been demonstrated through good performances on tasks following embedding, such as sentiment analysis and sentence classification. However, because the performances of sentence classification and sentiment analysis can be enhanced by using a simple sentence representation method, it is not sufficient to claim that these models fully reflect the meanings of sentences based on good performances for such tasks. In this paper, inspired by human language recognition, we propose the following concept of semantic coherence, which should be satisfied for a good sentence embedding method: similar sentences should be located close to each other in the embedding space. Then, we propose the Paraphrase-Thought (P-thought) model to pursue semantic coherence as much as possible. Experimental results on two paraphrase identification datasets (MS COCO and STS benchmark) show that the P-thought models outperform the benchmarked sentence embedding methods.

句子嵌入是自然语言处理中的一个重要研究课题。为了实现各种自然语言处理任务（例如机器翻译和文档分类）的增强性能，必须生成充分反映句子语义的良好嵌入向量。到目前为止，已经提出了各种句子嵌入模型，并且通过嵌入后的任务，例如情感分析和句子分类，已经证明了它们的可行性。然而，由于可以通过使用简单的句子表示方法来增强句子分类和情感分析的表现，因此声称这些模型基于对这些任务的良好表现来充分反映句子的含义是不够的。在本文中，受人类语言识别的启发，我们提出了以下语义连贯概念，这对于一个好的句子嵌入方法应该是满意的：相似的句子应该在嵌入空间中彼此靠近。然后，我们提出了复述 - 思想（P-thought）模型，以尽可能地追求语义连贯性。两个复述识别数据集（MS COCO和STS基准）的实验结果表明，P-思维模型优于基准句子嵌入方法。
