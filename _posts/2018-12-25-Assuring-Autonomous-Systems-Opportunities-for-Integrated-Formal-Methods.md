##### Abstract
Formal methods have provided approaches for investigating software engineering fundamentals and also have high potential to improve current practices in dependable systems assurance. In this article, we summarise known strengths and weaknesses of formal methods. From the viewpoint of the assurance of robots and autonomous systems (RAS), we highlight unique opportunities for empirical research on the integration of formal methods, for fundamental research on integrated formal methods, and for successful transfer of both strands of research into RAS assurance. Based on these opportunities, we present our position on certifiable RAS assurance using integrated formal methods. From this position, we argue directions for future research and research transfer as well as expectations on useful outcomes of such research.
