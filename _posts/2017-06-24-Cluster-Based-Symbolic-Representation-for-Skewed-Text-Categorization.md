##### Abstract
In this work, a problem associated with imbalanced text corpora is addressed. A method of converting an imbalanced text corpus into a balanced one is presented. The presented method employs a clustering algorithm for conversion. Initially to avoid curse of dimensionality, an effective representation scheme based on term class relevancy measure is adapted, which drastically reduces the dimension to the number of classes in the corpus. Subsequently, the samples of larger sized classes are grouped into a number of subclasses of smaller sizes to make the entire corpus balanced. Each subclass is then given a single symbolic vector representation by the use of interval valued features. This symbolic representation in addition to being compact helps in reducing the space requirement and also the classification time. The proposed model has been empirically demonstrated for its superiority on bench marking datasets viz., Reuters 21578 and TDT2. Further, it has been compared against several other existing contemporary models including model based on support vector machine. The comparative analysis indicates that the proposed model outperforms the other existing models.

在这项工作中，解决了与不平衡文本语料库相关的问题。介绍了一种将不平衡文本语料库转换为平衡文本的方法。所提出的方法采用聚类算法进行转换。最初为了避免维度诅咒，采用了基于词类关联度量度的有效表示方案，将维度大大降低到语料库中类别的数量。随后，较大尺寸的类别的样本被分组为较小尺寸的多个子类，以使整个语料库平衡。然后通过使用区间值特征给每个子类一个单一的符号向量表示。这种符号表示除了紧凑外，还有助于减少空间要求和分类时间。所提出的模型在实验室标记数据集，即路透社21578和TDT2上的优越性已经得到了实证证明。此外，它已经与包括支持向量机模型在内的其他几个现有模型进行了比较。比较分析表明，该模型优于其他现有模型。
