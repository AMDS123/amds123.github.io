##### Abstract
Feature selection has been studied widely in the literature. However, the efficacy of the selection criteria for low sample size applications is neglected in most cases. Most of the existing feature selection criteria are based on the sample similarity. However, the distance measures become insignificant for high dimensional low sample size (HDLSS) data. Moreover, the variance of a feature with a few samples is pointless unless it represents the data distribution efficiently. Instead of looking at the samples in groups, we evaluate their efficiency based on pairwise fashion. In our investigation, we noticed that considering a pair of samples at a time and selecting the features that bring them closer or put them far away is a better choice for feature selection. Experimental results on benchmark data sets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method with low sample size, which outperforms many other state-of-the-art feature selection methods.

特征选择已在文献中广泛研究。然而，在大多数情况下，忽略了低样本量应用的选择标准的有效性。现有的大多数特征选择标准都基于样本相似性。然而，对于高维低样本量（HDLSS）数据，距离度量变得不重要。另外，除非有效地表示数据分布，否则少量样本的特征方差是毫无意义的。我们不是分组看样本，而是基于成对的方式来评估他们的效率。在我们的调查中，我们注意到，一次考虑一对样本并选择使它们靠近或远离的特征是特征选择的更好选择。基准数据集上的实验结果证明了所提出的方法在低样本量的情况下的有效性，其优于许多其他的最先进的特征选择方法。
