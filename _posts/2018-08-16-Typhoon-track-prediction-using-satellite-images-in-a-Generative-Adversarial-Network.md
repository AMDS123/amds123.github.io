##### Abstract
Tracks of typhoons are predicted using satellite images as input for a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN). The satellite images have time gaps of 6 hours and are marked with a red square at the location of the typhoon center. The GAN uses images from the past to generate an image one time step ahead. The generated image shows the future location of the typhoon center, as well as the future cloud structures. The errors between predicted and real typhoon centers are measured quantitatively in kilometers. 42.4% of all typhoon center predictions have absolute errors of less than 80 km, 32.1% lie within a range of 80 - 120 km and the remaining 25.5% have accuracies above 120 km. The relative error sets the above mentioned absolute error in relation to the distance that has been traveled by a typhoon over the past 6 hours. High relative errors are found in three types of situations, when a typhoon moves on the open sea far away from land, when a typhoon changes its course suddenly and when a typhoon is about to hit the mainland. The cloud structure prediction is evaluated qualitatively. It is shown that the GAN is able to predict trends in cloud motion. In order to improve both, the typhoon center and cloud motion prediction, the present study suggests to add information about the sea surface temperature, surface pressure and velocity fields to the input data.

##### Abstract (translated by Google)
使用卫星图像作为生成对抗网络（GAN）的输入来预测台风的轨迹。卫星图像的时间间隔为6小时，并在台风中心位置标有红色方块。 GAN使用过去的图像生成一个图像，提前一步。生成的图像显示了台风中心的未来位置以及未来的云结构。预测台风中心与实际台风中心之间的误差以千米为单位进行定量测量。所有台风中心预测中有42.4％的绝对误差小于80 km，32.1％位于80-120 km范围内，其余25.5％的准确度大于120 km。相对误差将上述绝对误差设定为过去6小时台风所经过的距离。当台风在远离陆地的公海上移动，台风突然改变其路线以及台风即将袭击大陆时，三种情况都会出现较高的相对误差。定性评估云结构预测。结果表明，GAN能够预测云运动的趋势。为了改善台风中心和云运动预测，本研究建议将有关海面温度，表面压力和速度场的信息添加到输入数据中。
