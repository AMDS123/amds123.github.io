##### Abstract
In this work, we have concentrated our efforts on the interpretability of classification results coming from a fully convolutional neural network. Motivated by the classification of oesophageal tissue for real-time detection of early squamous neoplasia, the most frequent kind of oesophageal cancer in Asia, we present a new dataset and a novel deep learning method that by means of deep supervision and a newly introduced concept, the embedded Class Activation Map (eCAM), focuses on the interpretability of results as a design constraint of a convolutional network. We present a new approach to visualise attention that aims to give some insights on those areas of the oesophageal tissue that lead a network to conclude that the images belong to a particular class and compare them with those visual features employed by clinicians to produce a clinical diagnosis. In comparison to a baseline method which does not feature deep supervision but provides attention by grafting Class Activation Maps, we improve the F1-score from 87.3% to 92.7% and provide more detailed attention maps.

在这项工作中，我们集中精力研究来自完全卷积神经网络的分类结果的可解释性。在食管组织分类的基础上，实时检测亚洲最常见的食管癌，我们提出了一种新的数据集和一种新的深度学习方法，通过深度监督和新引入的概念，嵌入式类激活图（eCAM）侧重于将结果的可解释性作为卷积网络的设计约束。我们提出了一种可视化注意力的新方法，旨在对食管组织的这些领域提供一些见解，从而使网络得出结论：图像属于特定类别，并将它们与临床医生用于产生临床诊断的那些视觉特征进行比较。与没有深度监督但通过移植类激活图提供注意的基线方法相比，我们将F1得分从87.3％提高到92.7％，并提供更详细的注意图。
