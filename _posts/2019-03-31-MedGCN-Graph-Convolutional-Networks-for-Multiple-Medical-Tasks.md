##### Abstract
Laboratory testing and medication prescription are two of the most important routines in daily clinical practice. Developing an artificial intelligence system that can automatically make lab test imputations and medication recommendations can save cost on potentially redundant lab tests and inform physicians in more effective prescription. We present an intelligent model that can automatically recommend the patients' medications based on their incomplete lab tests, and can even accurately estimate the lab values that have not been taken. We model the complex relations between multiple types of medical entities with their inherent features in a heterogeneous graph. Then we learn a distributed representation for each entity in the graph based on graph convolutional networks to make the representations integrate information from multiple types of entities. Since the entity representations incorporate multiple types of medical information, they can be used for multiple medical tasks. In our experiments, we construct a graph to associate patients, encounters, lab tests and medications, and conduct the two tasks: medication recommendation and lab test imputation. The experimental results demonstrate that our model can outperform the state-of-the-art models in both tasks.
