##### Abstract
Since local feature detection has been one of the most active research areas in computer vision, a large number of detectors have been proposed. This has rendered the task of characterizing the performance of various feature detection methods an important issue in vision research. Inspired by the good practices of electronic system design, a generic framework based on the improved repeatability measure is presented in this paper that allows assessment of the upper and lower bounds of detector performance in an effort to design more reliable and effective vision systems. This framework is then employed to establish operating and guarantee regions for several state-of-the art detectors for JPEG compression and uniform light changes. The results are obtained using a newly acquired, large image database (15092 images) with 539 different scenes. These results provide new insights into the behavior of detectors and are also useful from the vision systems design perspective.

由于局部特征检测一直是计算机视觉领域最活跃的研究领域之一，因此提出了大量的检测器。这使得表征各种特征检测方法的性能成为视觉研究中的一个重要问题。受到电子系统设计良好实践的启发，本文提出了一种基于改进的可重复性测量的通用框架，该框架允许评估检测器性能的上限和下限，以设计更可靠和有效的视觉系统。然后，这个框架被用来建立操作和保证区域，用于JPEG压缩和均匀光变的几个最先进的检测器。使用新获得的具有539个不同场景的大图像数据库（15092个图像）获得结果。这些结果为探测器的行为提供了新的见解，并且从视觉系统设计的角度来看也是有用的。
