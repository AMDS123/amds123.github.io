##### Abstract
Today Bayesian networks are more used in many areas of decision support and image processing. In this way, our proposed approach uses Bayesian Network to modelize the segmented image quality. This quality is calculated on a set of attributes that represent local evaluation measures. The idea is to have these local levels chosen in a way to be intersected into them to keep the overall appearance of segmentation. The approach operates in two phases: the first phase is to make an over-segmentation which gives superpixels card. In the second phase, we model the superpixels by a Bayesian Network. To find the segmented image with the best overall quality we used two approximate inference methods, the first using ICM algorithm which is widely used in Markov Models and a second is a recursive method called algorithm of model decomposition based on max-product algorithm which is very popular in the recent works of image segmentation. For our model, we have shown that the composition of these two algorithms leads to good segmentation performance.

今天，贝叶斯网络更多地用于决策支持和图像处理的许多领域。这样，我们提出的方法使用贝叶斯网络模型化分割的图像质量。这个质量是根据代表当地评估指标的一组属性来计算的。我们的想法是选择这些地方级别，并将它们交叉在一起，以保持分割的整体外观。该方法分两个阶段进行：第一阶段是进行过度分割，产生超级像素卡。在第二阶段，我们通过贝叶斯网络对超像素进行建模。为了找到整体质量最好的分割图像，我们使用了两种近似推理方法，第一种使用在马尔科夫模型中广泛使用的ICM算法，第二种是递归方法，称为基于最大乘积算法的模型分解算法，在最近的图像分割工作中受欢迎。对于我们的模型，我们已经表明，这两种算法的组成导致良好的分割性能。
