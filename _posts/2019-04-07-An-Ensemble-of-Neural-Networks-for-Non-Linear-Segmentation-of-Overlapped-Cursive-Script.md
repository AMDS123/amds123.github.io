##### Abstract
Precise character segmentation is the only solution towards higher Optical Character Recognition (OCR) accuracy. In cursive script, overlapped characters are serious issue in the process of character segmentations as characters are deprived from their discriminative parts using conventional linear segmentation strategy. Hence, non-linear segmentation is an utmost need to avoid loss of characters parts and to enhance character/script recognition accuracy. This paper presents an improved approach for non-linear segmentation of the overlapped characters in handwritten roman script. The proposed technique is composed of a sequence of heuristic rules based on geometrical features of characters to locate possible non-linear character boundaries in a cursive script word. However, to enhance efficiency, heuristic approach is integrated with trained ensemble neural network validation strategy for verification of character boundaries. Accordingly, correct boundaries are retained and incorrect are removed based on ensemble neural networks vote. Finally, based on verified valid segmentation points, characters are segmented non-linearly. For fair comparison CEDAR benchmark database is experimented. The experimental results are much better than conventional linear character segmentation techniques reported in the state of art. Ensemble neural network play vital role to enhance character segmentation accuracy as compared to individual neural networks.
