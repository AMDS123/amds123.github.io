##### Abstract
Recent developments in image acquisition literature have miniaturized the confocal laser endomicroscopes to improve usability and flexibility of the apparatus in actual clinical settings. However, miniaturized devices collect less light and have fewer optical components, resulting in pixelation artifacts and low resolution images. Owing to the strength of deep networks, many supervised methods known as super resolution have achieved considerable success in restoring low resolution images by generating the missing high frequency details. In this work, we propose a novel attention mechanism that, for the first time, combines 1st- and 2nd-order statistics for pooling operation, in the spatial and channel-wise dimensions. We compare the efficacy of our method to 11 other existing single image super resolution techniques that compensate for the reduction in image quality caused by the necessity of endomicroscope miniaturization. All evaluations are carried out on three publicly available datasets. Experimental results show that our method can produce competitive results against state-of-the-art in terms of PSNR, SSIM, and IFC metrics. Additionally, our proposed method contains small number of parameters, which makes it lightweight and fast for real-time applications.
