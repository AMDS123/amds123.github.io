##### Abstract
Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images are subject to prominent speckle noise, which is generally considered a purely multiplicative noise process. In theory, this multiplicative noise is that the ratio of the standard deviation to the signal value, the "coefficient of variation," is theoretically constant at every point in a SAR image. Most of the filters for speckle reduction are based on this property. Such property is irrelevant for the new filter structure, which is based on directional smoothing (DS) theory, the enhanced directional smoothing (EDS) that removes speckle noise from SAR images without blurring edges. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this new filtering method by comparing it to established speckle noise removal techniques on SAR images.

##### Abstract (translated by Google)
合成孔径雷达（SAR）图像受到显着的散斑噪声的影响，这通常被认为是纯乘性噪声过程。从理论上讲，这种相乘噪声是指标准偏差与信号值之比“变异系数”在SAR图像的每个点上在理论上是恒定的。大多数减少斑点的过滤器都是基于这个属性。这种性质与基于方向平滑（DS）理论的新型滤波器结构无关，增强型方向平滑（EDS）技术可以去除SAR图像中的斑点噪声而不会模糊边缘。我们通过将其与SAR图像上建立的散斑噪声消除技术进行比较来证明这种新的滤波方法的有效性。
