##### Abstract
Diabetic Foot Ulcers (DFU) detection using computerized methods is an emerging research area with the evolution of machine learning algorithms. However, existing research focuses on detecting and segmenting the ulcers. According to DFU medical classification systems, i.e. University of Texas Classification and SINBAD Classification, the presence of infection (bacteria in the wound) and ischaemia (inadequate blood supply) has important clinical implication for DFU assessment, which were used to predict the risk of amputation. In this work, we propose a new dataset and novel techniques to identify the presence of infection and ischaemia. We introduce a very comprehensive DFU dataset with ground truth labels of ischaemia and infection cases. For hand-crafted machine learning approach, we propose new feature descriptor, namely Superpixel Color Descriptor. Then, we propose a technique using Ensemble Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model for ischaemia and infection recognition. The novelty lies in our proposed natural data-augmentation method, which clearly identifies the region of interest on foot images and focuses on finding the salient features existing in this area. Finally, we evaluate the performance of our proposed techniques on binary classification, i.e. ischaemia versus non-ischaemia and infection versus non-infection. Overall, our proposed method performs better in the classification of ischaemia than infection. We found that our proposed Ensemble CNN deep learning algorithms performed better for both classification tasks than hand-crafted machine learning algorithms, with 90% accuracy in ischaemia classification and 73% in infection classification.
