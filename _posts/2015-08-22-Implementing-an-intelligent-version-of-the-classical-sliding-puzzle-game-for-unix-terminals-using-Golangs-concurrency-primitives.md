##### Abstract
An intelligent version of the sliding-puzzle game is developed using the new Go programming language, which uses a concurrent version of the A* Informed Search Algorithm to power solver-bot that runs in the background. The game runs in computer system's terminals. Mainly, it was developed for UNIX-type systems but it works pretty well in nearly all the operating systems because of cross-platform compatibility of the programming language used. The game uses language's concurrency primitives to simplify most of the hefty parts of the game. A real-time notification delivery architecture is developed using language's built-in concurrency support, which performs similar to event based context aware invocations like we see on the web platform.
