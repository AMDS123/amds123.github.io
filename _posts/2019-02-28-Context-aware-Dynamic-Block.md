##### Abstract
Although deeper and larger neural networks have achieved better performance nowadays, the complex network structure and increasing computational cost cannot meet the demands of many resource-constrained applications. An effective way to address this problem is to make use of dynamic inference mechanism. Existing methods usually choose to execute or skip an entire specific layer through a switch structure, which can only alter the depth of the network. In this paper, we propose a dynamic inference method called Context-aware Dynamic Block (CDB), which provides more path selection choices in terms of network width and depth during inference. The execution of CDB is determined by a context-aware group controller, which can take into account both historical and object category information. The proposed method can be easily incorporated into most modern network architectures. Experimental results on ImageNet and CIFAR-100 demonstrate the superiority of our method on both efficiency and overall classification quality. To be specific, we integrate CDB block into ResNet-101 and find that our method significantly outperforms their counterparts and saves 45.1% FLOPs.
