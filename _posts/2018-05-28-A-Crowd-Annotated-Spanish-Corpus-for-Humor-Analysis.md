##### Abstract
Computational Humor involves several tasks, such as humor recognition, humor generation, and humor scoring, for which it is useful to have human-curated data. In this work we present a corpus of 27,000 tweets written in Spanish and crowd-annotated by their humor value and funniness score, with about four annotations per tweet, tagged by 1,300 people over the Internet. It is equally divided between tweets coming from humorous and non-humorous accounts. The inter-annotator agreement Krippendorff's alpha value is 0.5710. The dataset is available for general use and can serve as a basis for humor detection and as a first step to tackle subjectivity.

计算幽默涉及多个任务，如幽默识别，幽默生成和幽默评分，对于这些任务有人工策划的数据是有用的。在这项工作中，我们用西班牙语编写了27,000条推文，并以他们的幽默价值和趣味性评分进行了人群注释，每条推文约有四条注释，由互联网上的1,300人标记。对幽默和非幽默账户中的推文进行平等分配。内部注释器协议Krippendorff的alpha值为0.5710。该数据集可用于一般用途，可作为幽默检测的基础，并作为解决主观性的第一步。
