##### Abstract
The number of user reviews of tourist attractions, restaurants, mobile apps, etc. is increasing for all languages; yet, research is lacking on how reviews in multiple languages should be aggregated and displayed. Speakers of different languages may have consistently different experiences, e.g., different information available in different languages at tourist attractions or different user experiences with software due to internationalization/localization choices. This paper assesses the similarity in the ratings given by speakers of different languages to London tourist attractions on TripAdvisor. The correlations between different languages are generally high, but some language pairs are more correlated than others. The results question the common practice of computing average ratings from reviews in many languages.

##### Abstract (translated by Google)
所有语言的旅游景点，餐馆，手机应用程序等的用户评论数量都在增加。然而，对如何汇总和显示多种语言的评论缺乏研究。不同语言的演讲者可能具有始终不同的体验，例如，在旅游景点以不同语言提供的不同信息，或者由于国际化/本地化选择而对软件的不同用户体验。本文评估了不同语言的发言者对TripAdvisor旅游景点评分的相似性。不同语言之间的相关性一般较高，但有些语言对比较多。结果质疑计算多种语言平均评分的常见做法。
