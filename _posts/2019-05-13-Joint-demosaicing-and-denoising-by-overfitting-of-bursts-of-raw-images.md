##### Abstract
Demosaicking and denoising are the first steps of any camera image processing pipeline and are key for obtaining high quality RGB images. A promising current research trend aims at solving these two problems jointly using convolutional neural networks. Due to the unavailability of ground truth data these networks cannot be currently trained using real RAW images. Instead, they resort to simulated data. In this paper we present a method to learn demosacking directly from mosaicked images, without requiring ground truth RGB data. We apply this to learn joint demosaicking and denoising only from RAW images, thus enabling the use of real data. In addition we show that for this application overfitting a network to a specific burst improves the quality of restoration for both demosaicking and denoising.
