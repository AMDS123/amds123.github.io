##### Abstract
This paper presents a framework for recognition of human activity from egocentric video and eye tracking data obtained from a head-mounted eye tracker. Three channels of information such as eye movement, ego-motion, and visual features are combined for the classification of activities. Image features were extracted using a pre-trained convolutional neural network. Eye and ego-motion are quantized, and the windowed histograms are used as the features. The combination of features obtains better accuracy for activity classification as compared to individual features.

本文介绍了一种从头戴式眼动仪获取的以自我为中心的视频和眼动追踪数据识别人类活动的框架。三种渠道的信息，如眼球运动，自我运动和视觉特征被结合起来用于活动分类。使用预先训练的卷积神经网络提取图像特征。眼睛和自我运动是量化的，并且窗口化的直方图被用作特征。与单个特征相比，特征组合可以获得更好的活动分类准确性。
