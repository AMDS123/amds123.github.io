##### Abstract
This chapter introduces a novel target detector for hyperspectral imagery. The detector is independent on the unknown covariance matrix, behaves well in large dimensions, distributional free, invariant to atmospheric effects, and does not require a background dictionary to be constructed. Based on a modification of the Robust Principal Component Analysis (RPCA), a given hyperspectral image (HSI) is regarded as being made up of the sum of low-rank background HSI and a sparse target HSI that contains the targets based on a pre-learned target dictionary specified by the user. The sparse component (that is, the sparse target HSI) is directly used for the detection, that is, the targets are simply detected at the non-zero entries of the sparse target HSI. Hence, a novel target detector is developed and which is simply a sparse HSI generated automatically from the original HSI, but containing only the targets with the background is suppressed. The detector is evaluated on real experiments, and the results of which demonstrate its effectiveness for hyperspectral target detection especially when the targets have overlapping spectral features with the background.
