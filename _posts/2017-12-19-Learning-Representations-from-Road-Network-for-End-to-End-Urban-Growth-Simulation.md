##### Abstract
From our experiences in the past, we have seen that the growth of cities is very much dependent on the transportation networks. In mega cities, transportation networks determine to a significant extent as to where the people will move and houses will be built. Hence, transportation network data is crucial to an urban growth prediction system. Existing works have used manually derived distance based features based on the road networks to build models on urban growth. But due to the non-generic and laborious nature of the manual feature engineering process, we can shift to End-to-End systems which do not rely on manual feature engineering. In this paper, we propose a method to integrate road network data to an existing Rule based End-to-End framework without manual feature engineering. Our method employs recurrent neural networks to represent road networks in a structured way such that it can be plugged into the previously proposed End-to-End framework. The proposed approach enhances the performance in terms of Figure of Merit, Producer's accuracy, User's accuracy and Overall accuracy of the existing Rule based End-to-End framework.

根据我们过去的经验，我们看到城市的增长非常依赖于交通网络。在特大城市，交通网络在很大程度上决定了人们将在哪里移动和建造房屋。因此，交通网络数据对城市增长预测系统至关重要。现有的作品使用基于道路网络的手动派生的基于距离的特征来构建城市增长的模型。但是由于手动特征工程过程的非泛型和费力的性质，我们可以转向不依赖于手动特征工程的端到端系统。在本文中，我们提出了一种将路网数据集成到现有基于规则的端到端框架而不需要手动特征工程的方法。我们的方法采用递归神经网络以结构化的方式表示道路网络，从而可以将其插入到先前提出的端到端框架中。所提出的方法在现有基于规则的端到端框架的性能指标，生产者准确度，用户准确度和总体准确度方面提高了性能。
