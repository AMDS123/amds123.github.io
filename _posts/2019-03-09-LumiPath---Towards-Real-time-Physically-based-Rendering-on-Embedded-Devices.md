##### Abstract
As the computational power of toady's devices increases, real-time physically-based rendering becomes possible, and is rapidly gaining attention across a variety of domains. These include gaming, where physically-based rendering enhances immersion and overall entertainment experience, all the way to medicine, where it constitutes a powerful tool for intuitive volumetric data visualization. However, leveraging the obvious benefits of physically-based rendering (also referred to as photo-realistic rendering) remains challenging on embedded devices such as optical see-through head-mounted displays because of their limited computational power, and restricted memory usage and power consumption. We propose methods that aim at overcoming these limitations, fueling the implementation of real-time physically-based rendering on embedded devices. We navigate the compromise between memory requirement, computational power, and image quality to achieve reasonable rendering results by introducing a flexible representation of plenoptic functions and adapting a fast approximation algorithm for image generation from our plenoptic functions. We conclude by discussing potential applications and limitations of the proposed method.
