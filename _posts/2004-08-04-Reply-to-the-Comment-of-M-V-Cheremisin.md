##### Abstract
In the preprint cond-mat/0408050 M. V. Cheremisin noticed that some results (namely Fig. 4) of our recent work (cond-mat/0407364) have been taken from his paper cond-mat/0405176. As clear from the caption to Fig. 4 as well as from the text of our paper, we did not consider the curves shown in that Figure as our original results, but emphasized that they have been obtained in the well known paper Chiu and Quinn, Phys. Rev. B 9, 4724 (1974) 30 years ago. It is a surprise, that M. V. Cheremisin presents the 30-years-old results of Chiu and Quinn as his own results, obtained for the first time in cond-mat/0405176.

在预印本中，M.V.Cheremisin注意到我们最近的工作（cond-mat / 0407364）的一些结果（即图4）已经从他的论文cond-mat / 0405176中获得了。从图4的标题以及本文的文本中可以清楚看出，我们没有将该图中所示的曲线作为原始结果，而是强调已经在着名的论文Chiu和Quinn中得到，物理学。 Rev. B 9，4724（1974）30年前。令人惊讶的是，M. Cheremisin先生将Chiu和Quinn的30年历史结果作为自己的成果，首次在cond-mat / 0405176中获得。
