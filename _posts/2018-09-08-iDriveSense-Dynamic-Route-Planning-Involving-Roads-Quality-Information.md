##### Abstract
Owing to the expeditious growth in the information and communication technologies, smart cities have raised the expectations in terms of efficient functioning and management. One key aspect of residents' daily comfort is assured through affording reliable traffic management and route planning. Comprehensively, the majority of the present trip planning applications and service providers are enabling their trip planning recommendations relying on shortest paths and/or fastest routes. However, such suggestions may discount drivers' preferences with respect to safe and less disturbing trips. Road anomalies such as cracks, potholes, and manholes induce risky driving scenarios and can lead to vehicles damages and costly repairs. Accordingly, in this paper, we propose a crowdsensing based dynamic route planning system. Leveraging both the vehicle motion sensors and the inertial sensors within the smart devices, road surface types and anomalies have been detected and categorized. In addition, the monitored events are geo-referenced utilizing GPS receivers on both vehicles and smart devices. Consequently, road segments assessments are conducted using fuzzy system models based on aspects such as the number of anomalies and their severity levels in each road segment. Afterward, another fuzzy model is adopted to recommend the best trip routes based on the road segments quality in each potential route. Extensive road experiments are held to build and show the potential of the proposed system.

由于信息和通信技术的迅速发展，智能城市提高了对有效运作和管理的期望。通过提供可靠的交通管理和路线规划，确保居民日常舒适度的一个关键方面。综合而言，目前的大多数旅行计划应用和服务提供商都依赖于最短路径和/或最快路线来实现其旅行计划建议。然而，这些建议可能会降低驾驶员对安全和不那么令人不安的旅行的偏好。裂缝，坑洼和人孔等道路异常会导致危险的驾驶场景，并可能导致车辆损坏和昂贵的维修。因此，在本文中，我们提出了一种基于人群感知的动态路线规划系统。利用智能设备内的车辆运动传感器和惯性传感器，已经检测并分类了路面类型和异常。此外，使用车辆和智能设备上的GPS接收器对受监控事件进行地理参考。因此，路段评估是使用模糊系统模型进行的，这些模型基于诸如每个路段中的异常数量及其严重性级别等方面。之后，采用另一种模糊模型，根据每条潜在路线的路段质量推荐最佳行程路线。进行了广泛的道路试验，以建立和展示拟议系统的潜力。
