##### Abstract
Single image haze removal is a very challenging and ill-posed problem. The existing haze removal methods in literature, including the recently introduced deep learning methods, model the problem of haze removal as that of estimating intermediate parameters, viz., scene transmission map and atmospheric light. These are used to compute the haze-free image from the hazy input image. Such an approach only focuses on accurate estimation of intermediate parameters, while the aesthetic quality of the haze-free image is unaccounted for in the optimization framework. Thus, errors in the estimation of intermediate parameters often lead to generation of inferior quality haze-free images. In this paper, we present CANDY (Conditional Adversarial Networks based Dehazing of hazY images), a fully end-to-end model which directly generates a clean haze-free image from a hazy input image. CANDY also incorporates the visual quality of haze-free image into the optimization function; thus, generating a superior quality haze-free image. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work in literature to propose a fully end-to-end model for single image haze removal. Also, this is the first work to explore the newly introduced concept of generative adversarial networks for the problem of single image haze removal. The proposed model CANDY was trained on a synthetically created haze image dataset, while evaluation was performed on challenging synthetic as well as real haze image datasets. The extensive evaluation and comparison results of CANDY reveal that it significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art haze removal methods in literature, both quantitatively as well as qualitatively.

单一图像阴霾清除是一个非常具有挑战性和不适合的问题。文献中已有的雾霾消除方法，包括最近推出的深度学习方法，将雾霾消除的问题建模为估计中间参数，即场景透射图和大气光的问题。这些用于计算来自模糊输入图像的无雾图像。这种方法只侧重于中间参数的精确估计，而在优化框架中没有考虑到无雾图像的审美质量。因此，估算中间参数的误差经常导致产生质量较差的无雾图像。在本文中，我们展示了CANDY（基于条件对抗网络的hazY图像去雾），一个完全端到端的模型，可以从一个模糊的输入图像直接生成一个干净的无雾图像。 CANDY还将无雾图像的视觉质量融入优化功能;从而产生优质的无雾图像。就我们所知，这是文献中提出完全端对端模型去除单一图像雾霾的第一个工作。此外，这是第一个探索新的生成敌对网络概念的单一图像雾霾消除问题的工作。提出的模型CANDY是在一个综合创建的雾霾图像数据集上进行训练的，而对具有挑战性的合成以及真实的雾霾图像数据集进行评估。 CANDY广泛的评估和比较结果显示，它明显优于文献中现有的最新的雾霾消除方法，无论在数量上还是质量上。
