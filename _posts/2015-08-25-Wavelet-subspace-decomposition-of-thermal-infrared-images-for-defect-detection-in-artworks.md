##### Abstract
Monitoring the health of ancient artworks requires adequate prudence because of the sensitive nature of these materials. Classical techniques for identifying the development of faults rely on acoustic testing. These techniques, being invasive, may result in causing permanent damage to the material, especially if the material is inspected periodically. Non destructive testing has been carried out for different materials since long. In this regard, non-invasive systems were developed based on infrared thermometry principle to identify the faults in artworks. The test artwork is heated and the thermal response of the different layers is captured with the help of a thermal infrared camera. However, prolonged heating risks overheating and thus causing damage to artworks and an alternate approach is to use pseudo-random binary sequence excitations. The faults in the artwork, though, cannot be detected on the captured images, especially if their strength is weak. The weaker faults are either masked by the stronger ones, by the pictorial layer of the artwork or by the non-uniform heating. This work addresses the detection and localization of the faults through a wavelet based subspace decomposition scheme. The proposed scheme, on one hand, allows to remove the background while, on the other hand, removes the undesired high frequency noise. It is shown that the detection parameter is proportional to the diameter and the depth of the fault. A criterion is proposed to select the optimal wavelet basis along with suitable level selection for wavelet decomposition and reconstruction. The proposed approach is tested on a laboratory developed test sample with known fault locations and dimensions as well as real artworks. A comparison with a previously reported method demonstrates the efficacy of the proposed approach for fault detection in artworks.

监测古代艺术品的健康状况需要谨慎，因为这些材料的敏感性。用于识别故障发展的经典技术依赖于声学测试。这些侵入性技术可能会导致对材料的永久性损伤，特别是在材料被定期检查的情况下。长期以来，针对不同的材料进行了无损检测。在这方面，基于红外测温原理开发了非侵入式系统来识别艺术品中的缺陷。测试图稿被加热，并且借助热红外相机捕获不同层的热响应。然而，长时间的加热可能会导致过热，从而造成艺术品损坏，另一种方法是使用伪随机二进制序列激励。尽管如此，艺术品中的缺陷却无法在拍摄的图像上发现，特别是如果它们的实力较弱。较弱的缺陷要么被较强的缺陷掩盖，要么由艺术作品的图画层，或者由不均匀的加热掩盖。这项工作通过基于小波的子空间分解方案来解决故障的检测和定位问题。所提出的方案一方面允许消除背景，另一方面消除不希望的高频噪声。结果表明，检测参数与故障的直径和深度成正比。提出了一个准则，为小波分解和重构提供了选择最优小波基和适当的选择水平的准则。所提出的方法在具有已知故障位置和尺寸以及真实艺术品的实验室开发的测试样品上进行测试。与先前报道的方法的比较证明了所提出的方法在艺术品中的故障检测的功效。
