##### Abstract
Given the growing assortment of sentiment measuring instruments, it is imperative to understand which aspects of sentiment dictionaries contribute to both their classification accuracy and their ability to provide richer understanding of texts. Here, we perform detailed, quantitative tests and qualitative assessments of 6 dictionary-based methods applied, and briefly examine a further 20 methods. We show that while inappropriate for sentences, dictionary-based methods are generally robust in their classification accuracy for longer texts. 
 Stories often following distinct emotional trajectories, forming patterns that are meaningful to us. By classifying the emotional arcs for a filtered subset of 4,803 stories from Project Gutenberg's fiction collection, we find a set of six core trajectories which form the building blocks of complex narratives. Of profound scientific interest will be the degree to which we can eventually understand the full landscape of human stories, and data driven approaches will play a crucial role. 
 Finally, we utilize web-scale data from Twitter to study the limits of what social data can tell us about public health, mental illness, discourse around the protest movement of #BlackLivesMatter, discourse around climate change, and hidden networks. We conclude with a review of published works in complex systems that separately analyze charitable donations, the happiness of words in 10 languages, 100 years of daily temperature data across the United States, and Australian Rules Football games.

鉴于情感测量工具日益丰富，必须了解情感词典的哪些方面对分类的准确性和对文本更丰富的理解能力的贡献。在这里，我们对6种基于字典的方法进行了详细的定量测试和定性评估，并简要介绍了20种方法。我们表明，尽管不适合句子，基于字典的方法通常对较长文本的分类准确性较强。
 故事往往遵循不同的情感轨迹，形成对我们有意义的模式。通过对Gutenberg计划项目的4,803个过滤子集的情感弧进行分类，我们发现了一组六个核心轨迹，这些轨迹形成了复杂叙述的基石。深刻的科学兴趣将是我们最终能够理解人类故事全景的程度，数据驱动的方法将起到至关重要的作用。
 最后，我们利用来自Twitter的网络规模数据来研究社会数据可以告诉我们关于公众健康，精神疾病，围绕#BlackLivesMatter的抗议运动，围绕气候变化的话语以及隐藏网络的话语的界限。最后，我们对复杂系统中发表的作品进行了回顾，这些作品分别分析了慈善捐赠，10种语言的文字的快乐程度，美国100年的日常温度数据以及澳大利亚规则足球游戏。
