##### Abstract
In the modern era of automation and robotics, autonomous vehicles are currently the focus of academic and industrial research. With the ever increasing number of unmanned aerial vehicles getting involved in activities in the civilian and commercial domain, there is an increased need for autonomy in these systems too. Due to guidelines set by the governments regarding the operation ceiling of civil drones, road-tracking based navigation is garnering interest . In an attempt to achieve the above mentioned tasks, we propose an imitation learning based, data-driven solution to UAV autonomy for navigating through city streets by learning to fly by imitating an expert pilot. Derived from the classic image classification algorithms, our classifier has been constructed in the form of a fast 39-layered Inception model, that evaluates the presence of roads using the tomographic reconstructions of the input frames. Based on the Inception-v3 architecture, our system performs better in terms of processing complexity and accuracy than many existing models for imitation learning. The data used for training the system has been captured from the drone, by flying it in and around urban and semi-urban streets, by experts having at least 6-8 years of flying experience. Permissions were taken from required authorities who made sure that minimal risk (to pedestrians) is involved in the data collection process. With the extensive amount of drone data that we collected, we have been able to navigate successfully through roads without crashing or overshooting, with an accuracy of 98.44%. The computational efficiency of MAVNet enables the drone to fly at high speeds of upto 6m/sec. We present the same results in this research and compare them with other state-of-the-art methods of vision and learning based navigation.

在自动化和机器人技术的现代时代，自动驾驶汽车是目前学术和工业研究的焦点。随着越来越多的无人驾驶飞行器参与民用和商用领域的活动，这些系统对自治的需求也越来越大。由于政府制定了关于民用无人机运行上限的指导方针，基于道路跟踪的导航引起了人们的兴趣。为了实现上述任务，我们提出了一种基于模仿学习，数据驱动的无人机自主解决方案，通过模仿专家飞行员学习飞行来穿越城市街道。源自经典图像分类算法，我们的分类器以快速39层Inception模型的形式构建，该模型使用输入帧的断层摄影重建来评估道路的存在。基于Inception-v3架构，我们的系统在处理复杂性和准确性方面比许多现有的模仿学习模型表现更好。用于训练系统的数据已经从无人机中捕获，通过在城市和半城市街道及其周围飞行，具有至少6  -  8年飞行经验的专家。许可权来自必要的权威机构，他们确保数据收集过程中涉及的风险最小（对行人而言）。凭借我们收集的大量无人机数据，我们能够成功通过道路而不会发生碰撞或过冲，准确率为98.44％。 MAVNet的计算效率使无人机能够以高达6米/秒的高速飞行。我们在这项研究中提出了相同的结果，并将它们与其他最先进的视觉和学习导航方法进行了比较。
