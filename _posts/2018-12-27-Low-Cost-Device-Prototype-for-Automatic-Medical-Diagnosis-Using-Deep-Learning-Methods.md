##### Abstract
This paper introduces a novel low-cost device prototype for the automatic diagnosis of diseases, utilizing inputted symptoms and personal background. The engineering goal is to solve the problem of limited healthcare access with a single device. Diagnosing diseases automatically is an immense challenge, owing to their variable properties and symptoms. On the other hand, Neural Networks have developed into a powerful tool in the field of machine learning, one that is showing to be extremely promising at computing diagnosis even with inconsistent variables. 
 In this research, a cheap device was created to allow for straightforward diagnosis and treatment of human diseases. By utilizing Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), outfitted on a Raspberry Pi Zero processor ($5), the device is able to detect up to 1537 different diseases and conditions and utilize a CNN for on-device visual diagnostics. The user can input the symptoms using the buttons on the device and can take pictures using the same mechanism. The algorithm processes inputted symptoms, providing diagnosis and possible treatment options for common conditions. The purpose of this work was to be able to diagnose diseases through an affordable processor with high accuracy, as it is currently achieving an accuracy of 90% for Top-5 symptom-based diagnoses, and 91% for visual skin diseases. The NNs achieve performance far above any other tested system, and its efficiency and ease of use will prove it to be a helpful tool for people around the world. This device could potentially provide low-cost universal access to vital diagnostics and treatment options.
