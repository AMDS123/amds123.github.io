##### Abstract
"Natural Language," whether spoken and attended to by humans, or processed and generated by computers, requires networked structures that reflect creative processes in semantic, syntactic, phonetic, linguistic, social, emotional, and cultural modules. Being able to produce novel and useful behavior following repeated practice gets to the root of both artificial intelligence and human language. This paper investigates the modalities involved in language-like applications that computers -- and programmers -- engage with, and aims to fine tune the questions we ask to better account for context, self-awareness, and embodiment.

##### Abstract (translated by Google)
“自然语言”无论是由人类说话或处理，还是由计算机处理和生成，都需要在语义，句法，语音，语言，社会，情感和文化模块中反映创造过程的网络结构。能够通过反复练习，产生新颖有用的行为，成为人工智能和人类语言的根源。本文调查计算机和程序员所使用的语言类应用程序的模式，旨在微调我们所要求的更好地解释上下文，自我意识和实例的问题。
