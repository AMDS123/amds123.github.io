##### Abstract
The concept of a blockchain has given way to the development of cryptocurrencies, enabled smart contracts, and unlocked a plethora of other disruptive technologies. But, beyond its use case in cryptocurrencies, and in network coordination and automation, blockchain technology may have serious sociotechnical implications in the future co-existence of robots and humans. Motivated by the recent explosion of interest around blockchains, and our extensive work on open-source blockchain technology and its integration into robotics - this paper provides insights in ways in which blockchains and other decentralized technologies can impact our interactions with robot agents and the social integration of robots into human society.
