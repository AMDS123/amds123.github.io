##### Abstract
This paper presents a recognition system for handwritten Pashto letters. However, handwritten character recognition is a challenging task. These letters not only differ in shape and style but also vary among individuals. The recognition becomes further daunting due to the lack of standard datasets for inscribed Pashto letters. In this work, we have designed a database of moderate size, which encompasses a total of 4488 images, stemming from 102 distinguishing samples for each of the 44 letters in Pashto. The recognition framework uses zoning feature extractor followed by K-Nearest Neighbour (KNN) and Neural Network (NN) classifiers for classifying individual letter. Based on the evaluation of the proposed system, an overall classification accuracy of approximately 70.05% is achieved by using KNN while 72% is achieved by using NN.
