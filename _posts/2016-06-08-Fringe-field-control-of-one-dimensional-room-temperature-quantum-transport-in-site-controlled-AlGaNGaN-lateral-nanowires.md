##### Abstract
We have demonstrated effective fringe field control of one-dimensional electron gas (1-DEG) in AlGaN/GaN lateral nanowires. The nanowires are site controlled and formed by a combination of dry and anisotropic wet etching. The nanowire dimensions are well controlled and can have a very high length/width aspect ratio of 10 um/5 nm or larger. The transport is controlled by a fringe gate and shows room temperature quantum transport where gradual filling of 1-D subbands gets manifested as oscillations in the transconductance. The fringe gate threshold voltage for depletion of one-dimensional electron gas is found to increase with increasing drain voltage indicating efficient control of 1-DEG. The transport characteristics and fringe field operation are explained by taking into account quantum capacitance in addition to the conventional geometric capacitance. The effect of nanowire width and fringe gate position is also discussed.

我们已经证明在AlGaN / GaN横向纳米线中一维电子气（1-DEG）的有效的边缘场控制。纳米线是现场控制的，并通过干法和各向异性湿法蚀刻的组合形成。纳米线尺寸得到很好的控制，并且可以具有10微米/ 5纳米或更大的非常高的长度/宽度纵横比。运输是由一个边缘门控制，并显示室温量子运输，逐步填充的一维子带表现为跨导的振荡。发现一维电子气耗尽的边缘栅极阈值电压随着漏极电压的增加而增加，表明有效控制1-DEG。除了传统的几何电容外，还考虑到量子电容来解释传输特性和边缘场操作。还讨论了纳米线宽度和边缘门位置的影响。
