##### Abstract
Review websites, such as TripAdvisor and Yelp, allow users to post online reviews for various businesses, products and services, and have been recently shown to have a significant influence on consumer shopping behaviour. An online review typically consists of free-form text and a star rating out of 5. The problem of predicting a user's star rating for a product, given the user's text review for that product, is called Review Rating Prediction and has lately become a popular, albeit hard, problem in machine learning. In this paper, we treat Review Rating Prediction as a multi-class classification problem, and build sixteen different prediction models by combining four feature extraction methods, (i) unigrams, (ii) bigrams, (iii) trigrams and (iv) Latent Semantic Indexing, with four machine learning algorithms, (i) logistic regression, (ii) Naive Bayes classification, (iii) perceptrons, and (iv) linear Support Vector Classification. We analyse the performance of each of these sixteen models to come up with the best model for predicting the ratings from reviews. We use the dataset provided by Yelp for training and testing the models.

评论网站（例如TripAdvisor和Yelp）允许用户发布各种业务，产品和服务的在线评论，并且最近显示其对消费者购物行为具有显着的影响。在线评论通常由自由形式的文本和5分之一的星级评定组成。给定用户对该产品的文本评论，预测用户对产品的星级评级的问题被称为评论评级预测，并且近来已经变得流行虽然很难，机器学习的问题。在本文中，我们将Review Rating Prediction作为一个多类分类问题，结合四个特征提取方法（i）unigrams，（ii）bigrams，（iii）trigrams和（iv）潜在语义索引，四机器学习算法，（一）逻辑回归，（二）朴素贝叶斯分类，（三）感知器，和（四）线性支持向量分类。我们分析了这16个模型中的每一个模型的性能，从而得出评估评级的最佳模型。我们使用Yelp提供的数据集来训练和测试模型。
