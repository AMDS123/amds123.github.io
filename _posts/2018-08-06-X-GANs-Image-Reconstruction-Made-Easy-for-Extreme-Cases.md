##### Abstract
Image reconstruction including image restoration and denoising is a challenging problem in the field of image computing. We present a new method, called X-GANs, for reconstruction of arbitrary corrupted resource based on a variant of conditional generative adversarial networks (conditional GANs). In our method, a novel generator and multi-scale discriminators are proposed, as well as the combined adversarial losses, which integrate a VGG perceptual loss, an adversarial perceptual loss, and an elaborate corresponding point loss together based on the analysis of image feature. Our conditional GANs have enabled a variety of applications in image reconstruction, including image denoising, image restoration from quite a sparse sampling, image inpainting, image recovery from the severely polluted block or even color-noise dominated images, which are extreme cases and haven't been addressed in the status quo. We have significantly improved the accuracy and quality of image reconstruction. Extensive perceptual experiments on datasets ranging from human faces to natural scenes demonstrate that images reconstructed by the presented approach are considerably more realistic than alternative work. Our method can also be extended to handle high-ratio image compression.

包括图像恢复和去噪的图像重建是图像计算领域中的挑战性问题。我们提出了一种新的方法，称为X-GAN，用于基于条件生成对抗网络（条件GAN）的变体重建任意损坏的资源。在我们的方法中，提出了一种新的发生器和多尺度鉴别器，以及组合的对抗性损失，它们基于图像特征的分析将VGG感知损失，对抗感知损失和精细的对应点损失结合在一起。我们的条件GAN已经在图像重建中实现了各种应用，包括图像去噪，来自相当稀疏采样的图像恢复，图像修复，来自严重污染块的图像恢复或甚至是颜色噪声主导的图像，这是极端情况和避风港现状已得到解决。我们已经显着提高了图像重建的准确性和质量。对从人脸到自然场景的数据集进行的广泛的感知实验表明，通过所提出的方法重建的图像比替代工作更加真实。我们的方法也可以扩展到处理高比率图像压缩。
