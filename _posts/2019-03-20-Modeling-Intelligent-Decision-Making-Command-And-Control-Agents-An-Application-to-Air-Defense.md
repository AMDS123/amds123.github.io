##### Abstract
The paper is a half-way between the agent technology and the mathematical reasoning to model tactical decision making tasks. These models are applied to air defense (AD) domain for command and control (C2). It also addresses the issues related to evaluation of agents. The agents are designed and implemented using the agent-programming paradigm. The agents are deployed in an air combat simulated environment for performing the tasks of C2 like electronic counter counter measures, threat assessment, and weapon allocation. The simulated AD system runs without any human intervention, and represents state-of-the-art model for C2 autonomy. The use of agents as autonomous decision making entities is particularly useful in view of futuristic network centric warfare.
