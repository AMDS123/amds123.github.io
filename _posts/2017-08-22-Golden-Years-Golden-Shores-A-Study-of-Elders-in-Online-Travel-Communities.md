##### Abstract
In this paper we present our exploratory findings related to extracting knowledge and experiences from a community of senior tourists. By using tools of qualitative analysis as well as review of literature, we managed to verify a set of hypotheses related to the content created by senior tourists when participating in on-line communities. We also produced a codebook, representing various themes one may encounter in such communities. This codebook, derived from our own qualitative research, as well a literature review will serve as a basis for further development of automated tools of knowledge extraction. We also managed to find that older adults more often than other poster in tourists forums, mention their age in discussion, more often share their experiences and motivation to travel, however they do not differ in relation to describing barriers encountered while traveling.

在本文中，我们提出我们的探索性研究结果，从高级游客社区中提取知识和经验。通过使用定性分析工具和文献回顾，我们设法验证了一系列关于高级游客在参与在线社区时创建的内容的假设。我们还制作了一个代码簿，代表了这些社区可能遇到的各种主题。这个从我们自己的定性研究得到的码书以及文献综述将作为进一步开发知识提取自动化工具的基础。我们还设法在游客论坛上发现老年人比其他海报更经常地提到他们年龄的讨论，他们更经常分享他们的旅行经历和动机，但他们在描述旅行时遇到的障碍并没有什么不同。
