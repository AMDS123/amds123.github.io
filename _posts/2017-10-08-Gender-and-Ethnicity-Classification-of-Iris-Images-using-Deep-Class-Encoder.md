##### Abstract
Soft biometric modalities have shown their utility in different applications including reducing the search space significantly. This leads to improved recognition performance, reduced computation time, and faster processing of test samples. Some common soft biometric modalities are ethnicity, gender, age, hair color, iris color, presence of facial hair or moles, and markers. This research focuses on performing ethnicity and gender classification on iris images. We present a novel supervised autoencoder based approach, Deep Class-Encoder, which uses class labels to learn discriminative representation for the given sample by mapping the learned feature vector to its label. The proposed model is evaluated on two datasets each for ethnicity and gender classification. The results obtained using the proposed Deep Class-Encoder demonstrate its effectiveness in comparison to existing approaches and state-of-the-art methods.

软生物特征模式已经在不同的应用中显示出它们的实用性，包括显着减少搜索空间。这样可以提高识别性能，减少计算时间并加快测试样本的处理速度。一些常见的软生物测量模式是种族，性别，年龄，头发颜色，虹膜颜色，面部毛发或痣，以及标记。这项研究的重点是对虹膜图像进行种族和性别分类。我们提出了一种新的基于监督自编码器的方法，深层类编码器，它使用类标签通过将学习的特征向量映射到其标签来学习给定样本的区分表示。所提出的模型在两个数据集上评估，每个数据集用于种族和性别分类。使用所提出的深级编码器所获得的结果证明了其与现有方法和最先进方法相比的有效性。
