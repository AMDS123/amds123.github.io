##### Abstract
The deep convolutional neural network(CNN) has significantly raised the performance of image classification and face recognition. Softmax is usually used as supervision, but it only penalizes the classification loss. In this paper, we propose a novel auxiliary supervision signal called contrastivecenter loss, which can further enhance the discriminative power of the features, for it learns a class center for each class. The proposed contrastive-center loss simultaneously considers intra-class compactness and inter-class separability, by penalizing the contrastive values between: (1)the distances of training samples to their corresponding class centers, and (2)the sum of the distances of training samples to their non-corresponding class centers. Experiments on different datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of contrastive-center loss.

深层卷积神经网络（CNN）显着提高了图像分类和人脸识别的性能。 Softmax通常作为监督使用，但它只处罚分类损失。在本文中，我们提出了一种称为对比中心损失的辅助监督信号，它可以进一步增强特征的判别力，为每个类学习一个类中心。所提出的对比中心损失同时考虑了类内紧密性和类间可分性，通过惩罚（1）训练样本到其相应的类中心的距离和（2）训练距离的总和抽样到他们不相应的班级中心。不同数据集上的实验证明了对比中心损失的有效性。
