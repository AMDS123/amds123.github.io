##### Abstract
Aerial robots are becoming popular among general public, and with the development of artificial intelligence (AI), there is a trend to equip aerial robots with a natural user interface (NUI). Hand/arm gestures are an intuitive way to communicate for humans, and various research works have focused on controlling an aerial robot with natural gestures. However, the techniques in this area are still far from mature. Many issues in this area have been poorly addressed, such as the principles of choosing gestures from the design point of view, hardware requirements from an economic point of view, considerations of data availability, and algorithm complexity from a practical perspective. Our work focuses on building an economical monocular system particularly designed for gesture-based piloting of an aerial robot. Natural arm gestures are mapped to rich target directions and convenient fine adjustment is achieved. Practical piloting scenarios, hardware cost and algorithm applicability are jointly considered in our system design. The entire system is successfully implemented in an aerial robot and various properties of the system are tested.

空中机器人越来越受到大众的欢迎，随着人工智能（AI）的发展，装备自然用户界面（NUI）的空中机器人有一种趋势。手/手臂手势是人类沟通的直观方式，各种研究工作都集中在用自然手势控制空中机器人。但是，这方面的技术还很不成熟。在这方面的许多问题都没有得到很好的解决，例如从设计角度选择手势的原则，从经济角度考虑硬件要求，考虑数据可用性以及从实际角度考虑算法复杂性。我们的工作重点是建立一个经济的单眼系统，特别设计用于基于姿态的机器人驾驶。自然手臂手势被映射到丰富的目标方向，并实现方便的微调。我们的系统设计中共同考虑了实际的驾驶场景，硬件成本和算法适用性。整个系统在空中机器人中成功实施，系统的各种属性都经过测试。
