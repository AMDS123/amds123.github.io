##### Abstract
The Swarmathon is a swarm robotics programming challenge that engages college students from minority-serving institutions in NASA's Journey to Mars. Teams compete by programming a group of robots to search for, pick up, and drop off resources in a collection zone. The Swarmathon produces prototypes for robot swarms that would collect resources on the surface of Mars. Robots operate completely autonomously with no global map, and each team's algorithm must be sufficiently flexible to effectively find resources from a variety of unknown distributions. The Swarmathon includes Physical and Virtual Competitions. Physical competitors test their algorithms on robots they build at their schools; they then upload their code to run autonomously on identical robots during the three day competition in an outdoor arena at Kennedy Space Center. Virtual competitors complete an identical challenge in simulation. Participants mentor local teams to compete in a separate High School Division. In the first 2 years, over 1,100 students participated. 63% of students were from underrepresented ethnic and racial groups. Participants had significant gains in both interest and core robotic competencies that were equivalent across gender and racial groups, suggesting that the Swarmathon is effectively educating a diverse population of future roboticists.

##### Abstract (translated by Google)
Swarmathon是一项群体机器人编程挑战，它吸引了美国宇航局“火星之旅”中少数派服务机构的大学生。团队通过对一组机器人进行编程来搜索，拾取和收集收集区中的资源进行竞争。 Swarmathon为机器人群生产原型，这些机器人群将收集火星表面的资源。机器人完全自主操作，没有全球地图，每个团队的算法必须具有足够的灵活性，才能有效地从各种未知分布中找到资源。 Swarmathon包括实体和虚拟竞赛。体育竞争对手在他们在学校建造的机器人上测试他们的算法;然后他们在肯尼迪航天中心的室外竞技场举行的为期三天的比赛中，将自己的代码上传到同一机器人上，自主运行。虚拟竞争者在模拟中完成相同的挑战。参赛者指导本地球队在独立的高中分区进行比赛。在前两年里，有超过1100名学生参加。 63％的学生来自少数民族和种族群体。参与者在性别和种族群体的兴趣和核心机器人能力方面都有显着的提高，这表明Swarmathon正在有效地教育未来机器人专家的多元化。
