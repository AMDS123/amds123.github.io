##### Abstract
This work focuses on the semantic relations between scenes and objects for visual object recognition. Semantic knowledge can be a powerful source of information especially in scenarios with few or no annotated training samples. These scenarios are referred to as zero-shot or few-shot recognition and often build on visual attributes. Here, instead of relying on various visual attributes, a more direct way is pursued: after recognizing the scene that is depicted in an image, semantic relations between scenes and objects are used for predicting the presence of objects in an unsupervised manner. Most importantly, relations between scenes and objects can easily be obtained from external sources such as large scale text corpora from the web and, therefore, do not require tremendous manual labeling efforts. It will be shown that in cluttered scenes, where visual recognition is difficult, scene knowledge is an important cue for predicting objects.

这项工作着重于视觉对象识别的场景和对象之间的语义关系。语义知识可以成为一个强大的信息来源，特别是在很少或没有注释的训练样本的情况下。这些场景被称为零镜头或少镜头识别，通常建立在视觉属性上。在这里，不是依赖于各种视觉属性，而是采用更直接的方式：在识别出图像所描绘的场景之后，使用场景与对象之间的语义关系以无监督的方式预测对象的存在。最重要的是，场景和对象之间的关系可以很容易地从外部来源获得，例如来自网络的大规模文本语料库，因此不需要大量的人工标记工作。可见，在视觉识别困难的杂乱场景中，场景知识是预测物体的重要线索。
