##### Abstract
Inpainting-based generative modeling allows for stimulating human-machine interactions by letting users perform stylistically coherent local editions to an object using a statistical model. We present NONOTO, a new interface for interactive music generation based on inpainting models. It is aimed both at researchers, by offering a simple and flexible API allowing them to connect their own models with the interface, and at musicians by providing industry-standard features such as audio playback, real-time MIDI output and straightforward synchronization with DAWs using Ableton Link.
