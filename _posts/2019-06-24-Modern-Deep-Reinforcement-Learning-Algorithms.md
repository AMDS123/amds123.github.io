##### Abstract
Recent advances in Reinforcement Learning, grounded on combining classical theoretical results with Deep Learning paradigm, led to breakthroughs in many artificial intelligence tasks and gave birth to Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) as a field of research. In this work latest DRL algorithms are reviewed with a focus on their theoretical justification, practical limitations and observed empirical properties.
