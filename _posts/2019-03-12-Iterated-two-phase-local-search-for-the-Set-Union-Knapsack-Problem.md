##### Abstract
The Set-union Knapsack Problem (SUKP) is a generalization of the popular 0-1 knapsack problem. Given a set of weighted elements and a set of items with profits where each item is composed of a subset of elements, the SUKP involves packing a subset of items in a capacity-constrained knapsack such that the total profit of the selected items is maximized while their weights do not exceed the knapsack capacity. In this work, we present an effective iterated two-phase local search algorithm for this NP-hard combinatorial optimization problem. The proposed algorithm iterates through two search phases: a local optima exploration phase that alternates between a variable neighborhood descent search and a tabu search to explore local optimal solutions, and a local optima escaping phase to drive the search to unexplored regions. We show the competitiveness of the algorithm compared to the state-of-the-art methods in the literature. Specifically, the algorithm discovers 18 improved best results (new lower bounds) for the 30 benchmark instances and matches the best-known results for the 12 remaining instances. We also report the first computational results with the general CPLEX solver, including 6 proven optimal solutions. Finally, we investigate the effectiveness of the key ingredients of the algorithm on its performance.
