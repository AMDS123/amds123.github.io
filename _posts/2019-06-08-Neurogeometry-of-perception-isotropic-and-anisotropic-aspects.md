##### Abstract
In this paper we first recall the definition of geometical model of the visual cortex, focusing in particular on the geometrical properties of horizontal cortical connectivity. Then we recognize that histograms of edges - co-occurrences are not isotropic distributed, and are strongly biased in horizontal and vertical directions of the stimulus. Finally we introduce a new model of non isotropic cortical connectivity modeled on the histogram of edges - co-occurrences. Using this kernel we are able to justify oblique phenomena comparable with experimental findings.
