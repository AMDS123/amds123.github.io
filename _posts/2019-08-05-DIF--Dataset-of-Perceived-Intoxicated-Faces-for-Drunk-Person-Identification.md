##### Abstract
Traffic accidents cause over a million deaths every year, of which a large fraction is attributed to drunk driving. Automated intoxicated driver detection system in vehicles will be useful in reducing accidents and the related financial costs. Existing solutions require special equipment such as electrocardiogram, infrared cameras or breathalyzers. In this work, we propose a new dataset called DIF (Dataset of perceived Intoxicated Faces) containing audio-visual data of intoxicated and sober people obtained from online sources. To the best of our knowledge this is the first work for automatic bimodal non-invasive intoxication detection. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Deep Neural Networks (DNN) are trained for computing the video and audio baselines, respectively. 3D CNN is used to exploit the spatio-temporal change in the video. A simple variation of the traditional 3D convolution block is proposed based on inducing non-linearity between the spatial and temporal channels. Extensive experiments are performed in validating the approach and baselines.
