##### Abstract
Discriminating targets moving against a cluttered background is a huge challenge, let alone detecting a target as small as one or a few pixels and tracking it in flight. In the fly's visual system, a class of specific neurons, called small target motion detectors (STMDs), have been identified as showing exquisite selectivity for small target motion. Some of the STMDs have also demonstrated directional selectivity which means these STMDs respond strongly only to their preferred motion direction. Directional selectivity is an important property of these STMD neurons which could contribute to tracking small targets such as mates in flight. However, little has been done on systematically modeling these directional selective STMD neurons. In this paper, we propose a directional selective STMD-based neural network (DSTMD) for small target detection in a cluttered background. In the proposed neural network, a new correlation mechanism is introduced for direction selectivity via correlating signals relayed from two pixels. Then, a lateral inhibition mechanism is implemented on the spatial field for size selectivity of STMD neurons. Extensive experiments showed that the proposed neural network not only is in accord with current biological findings, i.e. showing directional preferences, but also worked reliably in detecting small targets against cluttered backgrounds.

识别杂乱背景的目标是一个巨大的挑战，更不用说检测像一个或几个像素的小目标，并在飞行中跟踪它。在苍蝇的视觉系统中，被称为小型目标运动探测器（STMD）的一类特定神经元已被确定为对小目标运动显示出精妙的选择性。一些STMD也显示出方向选择性，这意味着这些STMD只对它们的首选运动方向作出强烈响应。方向选择性是这些STMD神经元的一个重要属性，它可以有助于跟踪飞行中配对的小目标。然而，对这些定向选择性STMD神经元进行系统建模已经做了很少的工作。在本文中，我们提出了一个定向选择性的基于STMD的神经网络（DSTMD），用于杂乱背景下的小目标检测。在所提出的神经网络中，通过关联从两个像素中继的信号，引入了用于方向选择性的新的相关机制。然后，在STMD神经元的尺寸选择性的空间场上实施横向抑制机制。广泛的实验表明，所提出的神经网络不仅与目前的生物学发现一致，即表现出方向偏好，而且还可以可靠地检测出小杂乱背景的小目标。
