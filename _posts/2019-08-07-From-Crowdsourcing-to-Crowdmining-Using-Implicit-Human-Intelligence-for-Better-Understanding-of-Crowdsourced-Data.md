##### Abstract
With the development of mobile social networks, more and more crowdsourced data are generated on the Web or collected from real-world sensing. The fragment, heterogeneous, and noisy nature of online/offline crowdsourced data, however, makes it difficult to be understood. Traditional content-based analyzing methods suffer from potential issues such as computational intensiveness and poor performance. To address them, this paper presents CrowdMining. In particular, we observe that the knowledge hidden in the process of data generation, regarding individual/crowd behavior patterns (e.g., mobility patterns, community contexts such as social ties and structure) and crowd-object interaction patterns (flickering or tweeting patterns) are neglected in crowdsourced data mining. Therefore, a novel approach that leverages implicit human intelligence (implicit HI) for crowdsourced data mining and understanding is proposed. Two studies titled CrowdEvent and CrowdRoute are presented to showcase its usage, where implicit HIs are extracted either from online or offline crowdsourced data. A generic model for CrowdMining is further proposed based on a set of existing studies. Experiments based on real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of CrowdMining.
