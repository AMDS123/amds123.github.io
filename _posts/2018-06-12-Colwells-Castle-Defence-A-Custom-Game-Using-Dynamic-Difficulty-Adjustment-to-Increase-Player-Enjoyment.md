##### Abstract
Dynamic Difficulty Adjustment (DDA) is a mechanism used in video games that automatically tailors the individual gaming experience to match an appropriate difficulty setting. This is generally achieved by removing pre-defined difficulty tiers such as Easy, Medium and Hard; and instead concentrates on balancing the gameplay to match the challenge to the individual's abilities. The work presented in this paper examines the implementation of DDA in a custom survival game developed by the author, namely Colwell's Castle Defence. The premise of this arcade-style game is to defend a castle from hordes of oncoming enemies. The AI system that we developed adjusts the enemy spawn rate based on the current performance of the player. Specifically, we read the Player Health and Gate Health at the end of each level and then assign the player with an appropriate difficulty tier for the proceeding level. We tested the impact of our technique on thirty human players and concluded, based on questionnaire feedback, that enabling the technique led to more enjoyable gameplay.

动态难度调整（DDA）是一种用于视频游戏的机制，可自动调整个人游戏体验以匹配适当的难度设置。这通常通过移除预定义的困难层级来实现，例如Easy，Medium和Hard;而是专注于平衡游戏玩法以将挑战与个人能力相匹配。本文中介绍的作品考察了作者开发的定制生存游戏中的DDA的实现，即科尔威尔的城堡防御。这款街机风格的游戏的前提是从迎面而来的敌人群体中捍卫一座城堡。我们开发的AI系统根据玩家的当前表现调整敌方产卵率。具体来说，我们在每个级别结束时读取玩家健康和门卫，然后为玩家分配适当的难度级别以用于进程级别。我们测试了我们的技术对三十名人类玩家的影响，并根据问卷反馈得出结论，使该技术能够带来更愉快的游戏玩法。
