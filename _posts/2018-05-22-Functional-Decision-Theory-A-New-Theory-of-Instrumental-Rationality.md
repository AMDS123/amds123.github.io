##### Abstract
This paper describes and motivates a new decision theory known as functional decision theory (FDT), as distinct from causal decision theory and evidential decision theory. Functional decision theorists hold that the normative principle for action is to treat one's decision as the output of a fixed mathematical function that answers the question, "Which output of this very function would yield the best outcome?" Adhering to this principle delivers a number of benefits, including the ability to maximize wealth in an array of traditional decision-theoretic and game-theoretic problems where CDT and EDT perform poorly. Using one simple and coherent decision rule, functional decision theorists (for example) achieve more utility than CDT on Newcomb's problem, more utility than EDT on the smoking lesion problem, and more utility than both in Parfit's hitchhiker problem. In this paper, we define FDT, explore its prescriptions in a number of different decision problems, compare it to CDT and EDT, and give philosophical justifications for FDT as a normative theory of decision-making.

##### Abstract (translated by Google)
本文描述并激励了一种被称为功能决策理论（FDT）的新决策理论，它不同于因果决策理论和证据决策理论。功能决策理论家认为，行为的规范性原则是把一个人的决定看作是一个固定的数学函数的输出，它回答了“这个函数的哪个输出会产生最好结果？”的问题。坚持这一原则带来了许多好处，包括在CDT和EDT表现不佳的传统决策理论和博弈论问题中最大化财富的能力。使用一个简单而连贯的决策规则，功能决策理论家（例如）在Newcomb的问题上获得比CDT更多的实用性，在吸烟病变问题上比EDT更有用，并且比Parfit的搭便车问题更具实用性。在本文中，我们定义了FDT，探讨了它在许多不同决策问题中的处方，并将其与CDT和EDT进行了比较，并给出了FDT作为决策制定规范理论的哲学理由。
