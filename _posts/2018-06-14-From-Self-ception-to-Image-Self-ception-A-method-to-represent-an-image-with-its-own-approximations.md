##### Abstract
A concept of defining images based on its own approximate ones is proposed here, which is called 'Self-ception'. In this regard, an algorithm is proposed to implement the self-ception for images, which we call it 'Image Self-ception' since we use it for images. We can control the accuracy of this self-ception representation by deciding how many segments or regions we want to use for the representation. Some self-ception images are included in the paper. The video versions of the proposed image self-ception algorithm in action are shown in a YouTube channel (find it by Googling image self-ception).

##### Abstract (translated by Google)
这里提出了基于自己的近似图像定义图像的概念，称为“自我感知”。在这方面，提出了一种算法来实现图像的自我感知，我们称之为“图像自我感知”，因为我们将它用于图像。我们可以通过确定我们想要用于表示的区段或区域来控制此自我表示的准确性。本文包括一些自我接受的图像。在YouTube频道中显示了所提议的图像自我选择算法的视频版本（可以通过Google搜索图像自行找到）。
