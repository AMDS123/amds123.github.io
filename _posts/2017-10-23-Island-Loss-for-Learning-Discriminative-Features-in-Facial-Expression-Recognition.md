##### Abstract
Over the past few years, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have shown promise on facial expression recognition. However, the performance degrades dramatically under real-world settings due to variations introduced by subtle facial appearance changes, head pose variations, illumination changes, and occlusions. In this paper, a novel island loss is proposed to enhance the discriminative power of the deeply learned features. Specifically, the IL is designed to reduce the intra-class variations while enlarging the inter-class differences simultaneously. Experimental results on four benchmark expression databases have demonstrated that the CNN with the proposed island loss (IL-CNN) outperforms the baseline CNN models with either traditional softmax loss or the center loss and achieves comparable or better performance compared with the state-of-the-art methods for facial expression recognition.

在过去几年中，卷积神经网络（CNN）已经在面部表情识别方面显示出了前景。然而，由于微妙的面部外观变化，头部姿态变化，照明变化和遮挡引起的变化，在真实世界设置下性能显着降低。本文提出了一种新颖的岛屿损失来增强深度学习特征的判别力。具体而言，IL旨在减少类内差异，同时扩大类间差异。在四个基准表达式数据库上的实验结果表明，具有所提出的岛屿损失（CN-CNN）的CNN优于传统的最大损失或中心损失的基线CNN模型，并且实现了与状态用于面部表情识别的启动方法。
