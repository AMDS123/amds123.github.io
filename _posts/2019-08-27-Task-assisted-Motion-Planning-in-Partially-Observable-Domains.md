##### Abstract
We present an integrated Task-Motion Planning framework for robot navigation in belief space. Autonomous robots operating in real world complex scenarios require planning in the discrete (task) space and the continuous (motion) space. To this end, we propose a framework for integrating belief space reasoning within a hybrid task planner. The expressive power of PDDL+ combined with heuristic-driven semantic attachments performs the propagated and posterior belief estimates while planning. The underlying methodology for the development of the combined hybrid planner is discussed, providing suggestions for improvements and future work. Furthermore we validate key aspects of our approach using a realistic scenario in simulation.
