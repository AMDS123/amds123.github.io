##### Abstract
Robotic cell injection is used for automatically delivering substances into a cell and is an integral component of drug development, genetic engineering and many other areas of cell biology. Traditionally, the correctness of functionality of these systems is ascertained using paper-and-pencil proof and computer simulation methods. However, the paper based proofs can be human-error prone and the simulation provides an incomplete analysis due to its sampling based nature and the inability to capture continuous behaviors in computer based models. Model checking has been recently advocated for the analysis of cell injection systems as well. However, it involves the discretization of the differential equations that are used for modeling the dynamics of the system and thus compromises on the completeness of the analysis as well. In this paper, we propose to use higher-order-logic theorem proving for the modeling and analysis of the dynamical behaviour of the robotic cell injection systems. The high expressiveness of the underlying logic allows us to capture the continuous details of the model in their true form. Then, the model can be analyzed using deductive reasoning within the sound core of a proof assistant.

机器人细胞注射用于将物质自动递送到细胞中，并且是药物开发，基因工程和细胞生物学的许多其他领域的组成部分。传统上，使用纸笔证明和计算机模拟方法确定这些系统的功能的正确性。然而，基于纸张的证据可能容易出现人为错误，并且由于基于抽样的性质以及无法捕获基于计算机的模型中的连续行为，模拟提供了不完整的分析。最近还提出了模型检查以分析细胞注射系统。然而，它涉及用于对系统动力学进行建模的微分方程的离散化，从而也损害了分析的完整性。在本文中，我们建议使用高阶逻辑定理证明机器人细胞注入系统的动力学行为的建模和分析。底层逻辑的高表现力使我们能够以真实的形式捕捉模型的连续细节。然后，可以使用演示助手的声音核心内的演绎推理来分析模型。
