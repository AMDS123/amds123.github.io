##### Abstract
Quantum computers can offer dramatic improvements over classical devices for data analysis tasks such as prediction and classification. However, less is known about the advantages that quantum computers may bring in the setting of reinforcement learning, where learning is achieved via interaction with a task environment. Here, we consider a special case of reinforcement learning, where the task environment allows quantum access. In addition, we impose certain "naturalness" conditions on the task environment, which rule out the kinds of oracle problems that are studied in quantum query complexity (and for which quantum speedups are well-known). Within this framework of quantum-accessible reinforcement learning environments, we demonstrate that quantum agents can achieve exponential improvements in learning efficiency, surpassing previous results that showed only quadratic improvements. A key step in the proof is to construct task environments that encode well-known oracle problems, such as Simon's problem and Recursive Fourier Sampling, while satisfying the above "naturalness" conditions for reinforcement learning. Our results suggest that quantum agents may perform well in certain game-playing scenarios, where the game has recursive structure, and the agent can learn by playing against itself.

量子计算机可以为经典设备提供显着的改进，用于数据分析任务，如预测和分类。然而，关于量子计算机在强化学习的设置中可能带来的优势知之甚少，其中学习是通过与任务环境的交互来实现的。在这里，我们考虑强化学习的一个特例，其中任务环境允许量子访问。此外，我们在任务环境中施加了某些“自然”条件，这排除了在量子查询复杂性中研究的oracle问题的种类（并且量子加速是众所周知的）。在量子可访问的强化学习环境的框架内，我们证明量子代理可以在学习效率方面实现指数级的提高，超过之前仅显示二次改进的结果。证明的关键步骤是构建编码众所周知的oracle问题的任务环境，例如Simon的问题和Recursive Fourier Sampling，同时满足强化学习的上述“自然”条件。我们的结果表明量子代理可能在某些游戏场景中表现良好，其中游戏具有递归结构，并且代理可以通过对抗自身来学习。
