##### Abstract
While cognitive representations of an environment can last for days and even months, the synaptic architecture of the neuronal networks that underlie these representations constantly changes due to various forms of synaptic and structural plasticity at a much faster timescale. This raises an immediate question: how can a transient network maintain a stable representation of space? In the following, we propose a computational model for describing emergence of the hippocampal cognitive map in a network of transient place cell assemblies and demonstrate, using methods of algebraic topology, that such a network can maintain a robust map of the environment.
