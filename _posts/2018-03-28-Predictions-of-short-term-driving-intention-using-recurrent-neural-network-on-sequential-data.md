##### Abstract
Predictions of driver's intentions and their behaviors using the road is of great importance for planning and decision making processes of autonomous driving vehicles. In particular, relatively short-term driving intentions are the fundamental units that constitute more sophisticated driving goals, behaviors, such as overtaking the slow vehicle in front, exit or merge onto a high way, etc. While it is not uncommon that most of the time human driver can rationalize, in advance, various on-road behaviors, intentions, as well as the associated risks, aggressiveness, reciprocity characteristics, etc., such reasoning skills can be challenging and difficult for an autonomous driving system to learn. In this article, we demonstrate a disciplined methodology that can be used to build and train a predictive drive system, therefore to learn the on-road characteristics aforementioned.

预测驾驶员意图及其使用道路的行为对自动驾驶车辆的规划和决策过程非常重要。特别是，相对短期的驾驶意图是构成更复杂的驾驶目标，行为的基本单元，例如赶超前方的缓慢车辆，退出或融入高速路等等。虽然大多数情况并不罕见实时驾驶员可以事先将各种路上行为，意图以及相关风险，积极性，互惠特征等合理化，这样的推理技能对于自主驾驶系统学习来说可能具有挑战性和困难性。在这篇文章中，我们展示了一种有纪律的方法论，可以用来构建和训练一个预测性驱动系统，因此可以学习上述的道路特性。
