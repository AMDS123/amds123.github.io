##### Abstract
In metal organic vapor phase epitaxy of GaN, the growth mode is sensitive to reactor temperature. In this study, V-pit-shaped GaN has been grown on normal c-plane cone-patterned sapphire substrate by decreasing the growth temperature of high-temperature-GaN to around 950 oC, which leads to the 3-dimensional growth of GaN. The so-called "WM" well describes the shape that the bottom of GaN V-pit is just right over the top of sapphire cone, and the regular arrangement of V-pits follows the patterns of sapphire substrate strictly. Two types of semipolar facets (1101) and (1122) expose on sidewalls of V-pits. Furthermore, by raising the growth temperature to 1000 oC, the growth mode of GaN can be transferred to 2-demonsional growth. Accordingly, the size of V-pits becomes smaller and the area of c-plane GaN becomes larger, while the total thickness of GaN keeps almost unchanged during this process. As long as the 2-demonsional growth lasts, the V-pits will disappear and only flat c-plane GaN remains. This means the area ratio of c-plane and semipolar plane GaN can be controlled by the duration time of 2-demonsional growth.
