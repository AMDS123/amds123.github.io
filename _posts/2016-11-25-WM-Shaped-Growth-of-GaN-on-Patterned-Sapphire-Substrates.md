##### Abstract
In metal organic vapor phase epitaxy of GaN, the growth mode is sensitive to reactor temperature. In this study, V-pit-shaped GaN has been grown on normal c-plane cone-patterned sapphire substrate by decreasing the growth temperature of high-temperature-GaN to around 950 oC, which leads to the 3-dimensional growth of GaN. The so-called "WM" well describes the shape that the bottom of GaN V-pit is just right over the top of sapphire cone, and the regular arrangement of V-pits follows the patterns of sapphire substrate strictly. Two types of semipolar facets (1101) and (1122) expose on sidewalls of V-pits. Furthermore, by raising the growth temperature to 1000 oC, the growth mode of GaN can be transferred to 2-demonsional growth. Accordingly, the size of V-pits becomes smaller and the area of c-plane GaN becomes larger, while the total thickness of GaN keeps almost unchanged during this process. As long as the 2-demonsional growth lasts, the V-pits will disappear and only flat c-plane GaN remains. This means the area ratio of c-plane and semipolar plane GaN can be controlled by the duration time of 2-demonsional growth.

在GaN的金属有机气相外延中，生长模式对反应器温度敏感。在这项研究中，通过将高温GaN的生长温度降低到约950℃，在正常的c-平面锥形图案化的蓝宝石衬底上生长V-坑形GaN，从而导致GaN的三维生长。所谓的“WM”很好地描述了GaN V型坑的底部刚好在蓝宝石锥顶部正上方的形状，并且V型凹坑的规则排列严格遵循蓝宝石基板的图案。两种类型的半极性面（1101）和（1122）暴露在V坑的侧壁上。此外，通过将生长温度提高到1000℃，可以将GaN的生长模式转换成2-异常生长。因此，在此过程中，V坑的尺寸变小并且c面GaN的面积变大，而GaN的总厚度保持几乎不变。只要2-demonsional增长持续，V坑将消失，只有平面的c面GaN保留。这意味着c面和半极面GaN的面积比可以通过2-奇异生长的持续时间来控制。
