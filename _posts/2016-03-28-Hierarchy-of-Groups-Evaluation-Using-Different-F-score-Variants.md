##### Abstract
The paper presents a cursory examination of clustering, focusing on a rarely explored field of hierarchy of clusters. Based on this, a short discussion of clustering quality measures is presented and the F-score measure is examined more deeply. As there are no attempts to assess the quality for hierarchies of clusters, three variants of the F-Score based index are presented: classic, hierarchical and partial order. The partial order index is the authors' approach to the subject. Conducted experiments show the properties of the considered measures. In conclusions, the strong and weak sides of each variant are presented.

本文对集群进行了粗略的考察，重点讨论了一个很少被探索的集群层次结构领域。在此基础上，提出了聚类质量度量的简短讨论，并对F-score度量进行了更深入的研究。由于没有尝试评估集群等级的质量，因此提出了三种基于F分数的索引变体：经典的，分层的和部分的顺序。偏序索引是作者对主题的处理方式。进行的实验显示了所考虑的措施的性质。总结出每个变体的强弱两方面。
