##### Abstract
Given the size of modern cities in the urbanising age, it is beyond the perceptual capacity of most people to develop a good knowledge about the beauty and ugliness of the city at every street corner. Correspondingly, for planners, it is also difficult to accurately answer questions like 'where are the worst-looking places in the city that regeneration should give first consideration', or 'in the fast urbanising cities, how is the city appearance changing', etc. To address this issue, we here present a computer vision method for the large-scale and automatic evaluation of the urban visual environment, by leveraging state-of-the-art machine learning techniques and the wide-coverage street view images. From the various factors that are at work, we choose two key features, the visual quality of street facade and the continuity of street wall, as the starting point of this line of analysis. In order to test the validity of this method, we further compare the machine ratings with ratings collected on site from 752 passers-by on fifty-six locations. We show that the machine learning model can produce a good estimation of people's real visual experience, and it holds much potential for various tasks in terms of urban design evaluation, culture identification, etc.

考虑到城市化时代的现代城市规模，超越大多数人对每个街角的城市美与丑理解的认知能力。相应地，对于规划者来说，也很难准确地回答“再生首先应考虑的城市最糟糕的地方在哪里”，“在快速的城市化城市里，城市面貌如何变化”等问题。为了解决这个问题，我们通过利用最先进的机器学习技术和覆盖广泛的街景图像，提出了一种计算机视觉方法，用于大规模和自动评估城市视觉环境。从工作中的各种因素，我们选择两个关键特征，即街道立面的视觉质量和街道墙的连续性，作为这一分析的起点。为了测试这种方法的有效性，我们进一步比较了机器等级和现场收集到的来自752位路人的56个地点的等级。我们表明，机器学习模型能够对人们的真实视觉体验产生很好的估计，在城市设计评估，文化认同等方面，它具有很大的潜力。
