##### Abstract
Applications in robotics, such as multi-robot target tracking, involve the execution of information acquisition tasks by teams of mobile robots. However, in failure-prone or adversarial environments, robots get attacked, their communication channels get jammed, and their sensors fail, resulting in the withdrawal of robots from the collective task, and, subsequently, the inability of the remaining active robots to coordinate with each other. As a result, traditional design paradigms become insufficient and, in contrast, resilient designs against system-wide failures and attacks become important. In general, resilient design problems are hard, and even though they often involve objective functions that are monotone and (possibly) submodular, scalable approximation algorithms for their solution have been hitherto unknown. In this paper, we provide the first algorithm, enabling the following capabilities: minimal communication, i.e., the algorithm is executed by the robots based only on minimal communication between them, system-wide resiliency, i.e., the algorithm is valid for any number of denial-of-service attacks and failures, and provable approximation performance, i.e., the algorithm ensures for all monotone and (possibly) submodular objective functions a solution that is finitely close to the optimal. We support our theoretical analyses with simulated and real-world experiments, by considering an active information acquisition application scenario, namely, multi-robot target tracking.

##### Abstract (translated by Google)
机器人技术中的应用，例如多机器人目标跟踪，涉及移动机器人团队执行信息采集任务。然而，在容易出现故障或对抗的环境中，机器人受到攻击，他们的通信渠道被卡住，传感器失效，从而导致机器人从集体任务中撤出，并且随后，剩余的活动机器人无法与之协调彼此。因此，传统的设计模式变得不足，相反，针对全系统故障和攻击的弹性设计变得重要。一般而言，弹性设计问题很难，并且即使它们通常涉及单调和（可能）子模块的目标函数，但针对其解决方案的可伸缩近似算法迄今还未知。在本文中，我们提供了第一种算法，它具有以下功能：最小的通信量，即机器人仅基于它们之间的最小通信来执行算法，系统范围内的弹性，即该算法适用于任意数量的拒绝服务攻击和故障，以及可证明的近似性能，即该算法确保所有单调和（可能）子模块目标函数的解有限地接近最优。我们通过考虑主动信息采集应用场景，即多机器人目标跟踪，通过模拟和现实世界的实验支持我们的理论分析。
