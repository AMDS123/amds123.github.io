We introduce an entity-centric search engineCommentsRadarthatpairs entity queries with articles and user opinions covering a widerange of topics from top commented sites. The engine aggregatesarticles and comments for these articles, extracts named entities,links them together and with knowledge base entries, performssentiment analysis, and aggregates the results, aiming to mine fortemporal trends and other insights. In this work, we present thegeneral engine, discuss the models used for all steps of this pipeline,and introduce several case studies that discover important insightsfrom online commenting data.
