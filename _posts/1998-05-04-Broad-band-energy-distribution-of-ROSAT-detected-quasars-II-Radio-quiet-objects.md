##### Abstract
A database of radio-quiet quasars detected with ROSAT is presented containing 846 quasars seen in the All-Sky Survey and/or in pointed PSPC observations. About 70% of the objects have been detected in X-rays for the first time. We present the soft X-ray fluxes and spectra, if available. Using an optically selected subsample compiled from this database, we study the broad band properties of radio-quiet quasars with high statistical significance. We confirm that radio-quiet quasars have in general steeper soft X-ray spectra than radio-loud. The spectral differences persist to high redshifts. A spectral flattening with increasing redshift is confirmed up to redshift around 2, beyond which the spectral slopes seem to be independent of redshift. The spectral slopes of the ROSAT radio-quiet quasars at z>2.5 are consistent with those found for nearby quasars in the medium energy band (2-10keV), implying that the X-ray spectral evolution is not important. We show that there is, in a statistical sense, little or no excess absorption for most of the radio-quiet objects at z>2. The existence of a correlation between the X-ray luminosity and the luminosity at 2500A is confirmed. Individual objects show a large scatter from this correlation. The X-ray loudness alpha_ox appears to be independent of z, but the analyses indicate a slight increase of alpha_ox with optical luminosity. However, this behavior is likely not caused by physical properties inherent to the quasars but is the result of the intrinsic dispersion. Finally, we find a small fraction of objects which appear to be relatively `X-ray quiet' compared to the bulk of the other quasars.

用ROSAT检测到的无线电安静的类星体数据库包含了全天巡天和/或有针对性的PSPC观测中观测到的846颗类星体。 X射线中首次检测到约70％的物体。如果可用，我们提出软X射线通量和光谱。使用从这个数据库编辑的光学选择的子样本，我们研究具有高统计学意义的无线电安静类星体的宽带特性。我们确认无线电安静的类星体的软X-射线谱比无线电大。光谱差异持续到高红移。红移增加的频谱变平直到2左右红移，超过这个频谱斜率似乎独立于红移。 z> 2.5处的ROSAT无线电静止类星体的光谱斜率与在中能带（2-10keV）附近类星体的光谱斜率一致，这意味着X射线谱的演变并不重要。我们表明，在统计意义上，对于z> 2的大多数无线电安静的物体来说，很少或没有过度的吸收。证实了2500A处的X射线发光度与发光度之间存在相关性。单个物体显示出这种相关性的大分散性。 X射线响度alpha_ox似乎与z无关，但分析表明alpha_ox随光学亮度略有增加。然而，这种行为可能不是由类星体固有的物理性质引起的，而是由固有色散引起的。最后，我们发现与大部分其他类星体相比，似乎相对“X射线安静”的一小部分物体。
