##### Abstract
Background music in social interaction settings can hinder conversation. Yet, little is known of how specific properties of music impact speech processing. This paper addresses this knowledge gap by investigating 1) whether the masking effect of background music with lyrics is larger than that of music without lyrics, and 2) whether the masking effect is larger for more complex music. To answer these questions, a word identification experiment was run in which Dutch participants listened to Dutch CVC words embedded in stretches of background music in two conditions, with and without lyrics, and at three SNRs. Three songs were used of different genres and complexities. Music stretches with and without lyrics were sampled from the same song in order to control for factors beyond the presence of lyrics. The results showed a clear negative impact of the presence of lyrics in background music on spoken-word recognition. This impact is independent of complexity. The results suggest that social spaces (e.g., restaurants, caf\'es and bars) should make careful choices of music to promote conversation, and open a path for future work.

社交互动设置中的背景音乐可能会阻碍对话。然而，很少有人知道音乐的具体特性如何影响语音处理。本文通过以下研究来解决这一知识差距：1）背景音乐与歌词的掩蔽效果是否大于没有歌词的音乐的掩蔽效果; 2）对于更复杂的音乐，掩蔽效果是否较大。为了回答这些问题，我们运行了一个单词识别实验，在这个实验中，荷兰的参与者在两种情况下，有和没有歌词，以及三种信噪比情况下，都会收听荷兰CVC词汇。三首歌曲使用了不同的风格和复杂性。从同一首歌曲中抽取带有歌词和不带歌词的音乐，以控制超出歌词存在的因素。结果显示背景音乐中的歌词存在对口头词语识别的明显负面影响。这种影响与复杂性无关。结果表明，社交空间（如餐厅，咖啡馆和酒吧）应该仔细选择音乐来促进对话，并为未来的工作开辟道路。
