##### Abstract
Mobile robots, performing long-term manipulation activities in human environments, have to perceive a wide variety of objects possessing very different visual characteristics and need to reliably keep track of these throughout the execution of a task. In order to be efficient, robot perception capabilities need to go beyond what is currently perceivable and should be able to answer queries about both current and past scenes. In this paper we investigate a perception system for long-term robot manipulation that keeps track of the changing environment and builds a representation of the perceived world. Specifically we introduce an amortized component that spreads perception tasks throughout the execution cycle. The resulting query driven perception system asynchronously integrates results from logged images into a symbolic and numeric (what we call sub-symbolic) representation that forms the perceptual belief state of the robot.
