##### Abstract
The authorship attribution is a problem of considerable practical and technical interest. Several methods have been designed to infer the authorship of disputed documents in multiple contexts. While traditional statistical methods based solely on word counts and related measurements have provided a simple, yet effective solution in particular cases; they are prone to manipulation. Recently, texts have been successfully modeled as networks, where words are represented by nodes linked according to textual similarity measurements. Such models are useful to identify informative topological patterns for the authorship recognition task. However, there is no consensus on which measurements should be used. Thus, we proposed a novel method to characterize text networks, by considering both topological and dynamical aspects of networks. Using concepts and methods from cellular automata theory, we devised a strategy to grasp informative spatio-temporal patterns from this model. Our experiments revealed an outperformance over traditional analysis relying only on topological measurements. Remarkably, we have found a dependence of pre-processing steps (such as the lemmatization) on the obtained results, a feature that has mostly been disregarded in related works. The optimized results obtained here pave the way for a better characterization of textual networks.

作者归属是具有相当实际和技术意义的问题。已经设计了几种方法来推断在多个上下文中争议文档的作者身份。虽然仅基于字数和相关测量的传统统计方法在特定情况下提供了简单而有效的解决方案;他们很容易操纵。最近，文本已经成功地建模为网络，其中文字由根据文本相似性度量链接的节点表示。这样的模型对于识别作者身份识别任务的信息拓扑模式是有用的。但是，对于应该使用哪种测量方法还没有达成共识。因此，我们提出了一种新的方法来表征文本网络，考虑网络的拓扑和动态两个方面。利用细胞自动机理论的概念和方法，我们设计了一个从这个模型中掌握信息时空模式的策略。我们的实验揭示了仅依赖于拓扑测量的传统分析的优越性。值得注意的是，我们发现预处理步骤（如简化）对所得结果的依赖性，这在相关作品中大多被忽视。这里获得的优化结果为更好地表征文本网络铺平了道路。
