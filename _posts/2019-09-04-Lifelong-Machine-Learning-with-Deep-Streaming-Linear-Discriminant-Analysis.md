##### Abstract
When a robot acquires new information, ideally it would immediately be capable of using that information to understand its environment. While deep neural networks are now widely used by robots for inferring semantic information, conventional neural networks suffer from catastrophic forgetting when they are incrementally updated, with new knowledge overwriting established representations. While a variety of approaches have been developed that attempt to mitigate catastrophic forgetting in the incremental batch learning scenario, in which an agent learns a large collection of labeled samples at once, streaming learning has been much less studied in the robotics and deep learning communities. In streaming learning, an agent learns instances one-by-one and can be tested at any time. Here, we revisit streaming linear discriminant analysis, which has been widely used in the data mining research community. By combining streaming linear discriminant analysis with deep learning, we are able to outperform both incremental batch learning and streaming learning algorithms on both ImageNet-1K and CORe50.
