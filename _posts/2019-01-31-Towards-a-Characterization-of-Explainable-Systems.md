##### Abstract
Building software-driven systems that are easily understood becomes a challenge, with their ever-increasing complexity and autonomy. Accordingly, recent research efforts strive to aid in designing explainable systems. Nevertheless, a common notion of what it takes for a system to be explainable is still missing. To address this problem, we propose a characterization of explainable systems that consolidates existing research. By providing a unified terminology, we lay a basis for the classification of both existing and future research, and the formulation of precise requirements towards such systems.
