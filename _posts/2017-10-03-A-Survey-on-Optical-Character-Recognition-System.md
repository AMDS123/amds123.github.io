##### Abstract
Optical Character Recognition (OCR) has been a topic of interest for many years. It is defined as the process of digitizing a document image into its constituent characters. Despite decades of intense research, developing OCR with capabilities comparable to that of human still remains an open challenge. Due to this challenging nature, researchers from industry and academic circles have directed their attentions towards Optical Character Recognition. Over the last few years, the number of academic laboratories and companies involved in research on Character Recognition has increased dramatically. This research aims at summarizing the research so far done in the field of OCR. It provides an overview of different aspects of OCR and discusses corresponding proposals aimed at resolving issues of OCR.

光学字符识别（OCR）多年来一直是人们关注的话题。它被定义为将文档图像数字化为其组成字符的过程。尽管经过数十年的深入研究，开发具有与人类相媲美的功能的OCR仍然是一个公开的挑战。由于这一具有挑战性的性质，来自行业和学术界的研究人员已经将注意力投向了光学字符识别。在过去几年中，参与字符识别研究的学术实验室和公司的数量急剧增加。本研究旨在总结迄今为止在OCR领域所做的研究。它概述了OCR的不同方面，并讨论了相应的建议，旨在解决OCR的问题。
