##### Abstract
In this work, a novel deep learning technique for the recognition of handwritten Bangla isolated compound character is presented and a new benchmark of recognition accuracy on the CMATERdb 3.1.3.3 dataset is reported. Greedy layer wise training of Deep Neural Network has helped to make significant strides in various pattern recognition problems. We employ layerwise training to Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (DCNN) in a supervised fashion and augment the training process with the RMSProp algorithm to achieve faster convergence. We compare results with those obtained from standard shallow learning methods with predefined features, as well as standard DCNNs. Supervised layerwise trained DCNNs are found to outperform standard shallow learning models such as Support Vector Machines as well as regular DCNNs of similar architecture by achieving error rate of 9.67% thereby setting a new benchmark on the CMATERdb 3.1.3.3 with recognition accuracy of 90.33%, representing an improvement of nearly 10%.

在这项工作中，提出了一种识别手写孟加拉分离复合字符的深度学习技术，并在CMATERdb 3.1.3.3数据集上进行了识别精度的新的基准。深度神经网络的贪婪层次训练有助于在各种模式识别问题上取得重大进展。我们以监督的方式对深度卷积神经网络（DCNN）采用分层训练，并用RMSProp算法增强训练过程以实现更快的收敛。我们将结果与从具有预定义特征的标准浅层学习方法以及标准DCNN中获得的结果进行比较。发现有监督分层训练的DCNNs比支持向量机等标准浅层学习模型以及相似体系结构的规则DCNN性能更好，达到了9.67％的错误率，从而在CMATERdb 3.1.3.3上设立了新的基准，识别率为90.33％比上年增长近10％。
