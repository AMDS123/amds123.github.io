##### Abstract
Robotic systems are multi-dimensional entities, combining both hardware and software, that are heavily dependent on, and influenced by, interactions with the real world. They can be variously categorised as embedded, cyberphysical, real-time, hybrid, adaptive and even autonomous systems, with a typical robotic system being likely to contain all of these aspects. The techniques for developing and verifying each of these system varieties are often quite distinct. This, together with the sheer complexity of robotic systems, leads us to argue that diverse formal techniques must be integrated in order to develop, verify, and provide certification evidence for, robotic systems. Furthermore, we propose the fast evolving field of robotics as an ideal catalyst for the advancement of integrated formal methods research, helping to drive the field in new and exciting directions and shedding light on the development of large-scale, dynamic, complex systems.

##### Abstract (translated by Google)
机器人系统是多维实体，结合了硬件和软件，严重依赖于现实世界并与之相互作用并受其影响。它们可以分为嵌入式，网络物理，实时，混合，自适应甚至自治系统，典型的机器人系统可能包含所有这些方面。开发和验证这些系统品种的技术往往截然不同。这与机器人系统的复杂性一起导致我们认为，为了开发，验证和提供机器人系统的认证证据，必须整合各种形式化的技术。此外，我们提出快速发展的机器人领域作为推进综合形式方法研究的理想催化剂，有助于推动这一领域朝着新的激动人心的方向发展，并为大规模，动态，复杂的系统的发展指明方向。
