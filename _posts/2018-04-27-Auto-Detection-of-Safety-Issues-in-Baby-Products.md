##### Abstract
Every year, thousands of people receive consumer product related injuries. Research indicates that online customer reviews can be processed to autonomously identify product safety issues. Early identification of safety issues can lead to earlier recalls, and thus fewer injuries and deaths. A dataset of product reviews from Amazon.com was compiled, along with \emph{SaferProducts.gov} complaints and recall descriptions from the Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) and European Commission Rapid Alert system. A system was built to clean the collected text and to extract relevant features. Dimensionality reduction was performed by computing feature relevance through a Random Forest and discarding features with low information gain. Various classifiers were analyzed, including Logistic Regression, SVMs, Na{\"i}ve-Bayes, Random Forests, and an Ensemble classifier. Experimentation with various features and classifier combinations resulted in a logistic regression model with 70.2\% precision in the top 50 reviews surfaced. This classifier outperforms all benchmarks set by related literature and consumer product safety professionals.

每年有数千人接受与消费品相关的伤害。研究表明，可以处理在线客户评论以自主识别产品安全问题。及早发现安全问题可以提前召回，从而减少人员伤亡。来自Amazon.com的产品评论数据集与来自消费品安全委员会（CPSC）和欧盟委员会快速警报系统的\ emph {SaferProducts.gov}投诉和召回说明一起编译。构建了一个系统来清理收集的文本并提取相关的功能。通过随机森林计算特征相关性并丢弃具有低信息增益的特征来执行降维。对各种分类器进行了分析，包括Logistic回归，支持向量机，随机森林和集合分类器，利用各种特征和分类器组合进行实验，得到一个逻辑回归模型，顶部精度为70.2％ 50篇评论浮出水面，该分类器优于相关文献和消费品安全专业人士设定的所有基准。
