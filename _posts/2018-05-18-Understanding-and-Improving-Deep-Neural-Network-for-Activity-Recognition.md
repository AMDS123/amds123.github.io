##### Abstract
Activity recognition has become a popular research branch in the field of pervasive computing in recent years. A large number of experiments can be obtained that activity sensor-based data's characteristic in activity recognition is variety, volume, and velocity. Deep learning technology, together with its various models, is one of the most effective ways of working on activity data. Nevertheless, there is no clear understanding of why it performs so well or how to make it more effective. In order to solve this problem, first, we applied convolution neural network on Human Activity Recognition Using Smart phones Data Set. Second, we realized the visualization of the sensor-based activity's data features extracted from the neural network. Then we had in-depth analysis of the visualization of features, explored the relationship between activity and features, and analyzed how Neural Networks identify activity based on these features. After that, we extracted the significant features related to the activities and sent the features to the DNN-based fusion model, which improved the classification rate to 96.1%. This is the first work to our knowledge that visualizes abstract sensor-based activity data features. Based on the results, the method proposed in the paper promises to realize the accurate classification of sensor- based activity recognition.

活动识别近年来已成为普及计算领域的热门研究分支。基于活动传感器的数据在活动识别中的特征是种类，体积和速度，可以获得大量的实验。深度学习技术及其各种模型是处理活动数据的最有效方法之一。尽管如此，对于它为什么表现如此出色以及如何使其更加有效还不清楚。为了解决这个问题，首先，我们将卷积神经网络应用于使用智能手机数据集的人类活动识别。其次，我们实现了从神经网络提取的基于传感器的活动数据特征的可视化。然后，我们深入分析了特征的可视化，探索了活动与特征之间的关系，并分析了神经网络如何根据这些特征识别活动。之后，我们提取与活动相关的重要特征，并将特征发送到基于DNN的融合模型，将分类率提高到96.1％。这是我们的第一项将抽象的基于传感器的活动数据特征可视化的工作。基于该结果，本文提出的方法有望实现基于传感器的活动识别的准确分类。
