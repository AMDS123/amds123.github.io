##### Abstract
Person re-identification is best known as the problem of associating a single person that is observed from one or more disjoint cameras. The existing literature has mainly addressed such an issue, neglecting the fact that people usually move in groups, like in crowded scenarios. We believe that the additional information carried by neighboring individuals provides a relevant visual context that can be exploited to obtain a more robust match of single persons within the group. Despite this, re-identifying groups of people compound the common single person re-identification problems by introducing changes in the relative position of persons within the group and severe self-occlusions. In this paper, we propose a solution for group re-identification that grounds on transferring knowledge from single person re-identification to group re-identification by exploiting sparse dictionary learning. First, a dictionary of sparse atoms is learned using patches extracted from single person images. Then, the learned dictionary is exploited to obtain a sparsity-driven residual group representation, which is finally matched to perform the re-identification. Extensive experiments on the i-LIDS groups and two newly collected datasets show that the proposed solution outperforms state-of-the-art approaches.

人物重新识别最为人所知的是，从一个或多个不相交的相机观察到的单个人的关联问题。现有的文献主要是针对这样一个问题，忽略了人们通常在群体中移动的事实，比如在拥挤的场景中。我们相信，邻居个人携带的附加信息提供了一个相关的视觉环境，可以利用这些环境获得团体内单身者更加强大的匹配。尽管如此，通过改变组内人员的相对位置和严重的自闭症，重新确定人群会增加常见的单身人员重新识别问题。在本文中，我们提出了一个解决群体再识别的理由是通过利用稀疏字典学习将知识从单个人重新识别转移到群体重新识别。首先，使用从单人图像提取的补丁来学习稀疏原子字典。然后利用学习的词典获得稀疏驱动的残差组表示，最终匹配进行重新识别。在i-LIDS组和两个新收集的数据集上进行的大量实验表明，所提出的解决方案胜过了最新的方法。
