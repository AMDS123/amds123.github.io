##### Abstract
Deep Learning is considered to be a quite young in the area of machine learning research, found its effectiveness in dealing complex yet high dimensional dataset that includes but limited to images, text and speech etc. with multiple levels of representation and abstraction. As there are a plethora of research on these datasets by various researchers , a win over them needs lots of attention. Careful setting of Deep learning parameters is of paramount importance in order to avoid the overfitting unlike conventional methods with limited parameter settings. Deep Convolutional neural network (DCNN) with multiple layers of compositions and appropriate settings might be is an efficient machine learning method that can outperform the conventional methods in a great way. However, due to its slow adoption in learning, there are also always a chance of overfitting during feature selection process, which can be addressed by employing a regularization method called dropout. Fast Random Forest (FRF) is a powerful ensemble classifier especially when the datasets are noisy and when the number of attributes is large in comparison to the number of instances, as is the case of Bioinformatics datasets. Several publicly available Bioinformatics dataset, Handwritten digits recognition and Image segmentation dataset are considered for evaluation of the proposed approach. The excellent performance obtained by the proposed DCNN based feature selection with FRF classifier on high dimensional datasets makes it a fast and accurate classifier in comparison the state-of-the-art.

深度学习在机器学习研究领域被认为是一个相当年轻的领域，在处理复杂而高维度的数据集方面发挥了有效的作用，其中包括但仅限于图像，文本和语音等多层次的表示和抽象。由于各个研究人员对这些数据集进行了大量的研究，所以需要引起足够的重视。仔细设置深度学习参数是非常重要的，以避免与传统方法有限的参数设置不同。深度卷积神经网络（DCNN）具有多层次的组合和适当的设置，可能是一种有效的机器学习方法，它可以很好地胜过传统的方法。然而，由于学习速度缓慢，在特征选择过程中总会有过度拟合的机会，这可以通过使用称为丢失的正则化方法来解决。快速随机森林（FRF）是一个功能强大的集成分类器，特别是在数据集有噪声的时候，以及与生物信息学数据集的情况相比，属性数量大的情况下。几个公开可用的生物信息学数据集，手写数字识别和图像分割数据集被考虑用于评估所提出的方法。通过在高维数据集上利用FRF分类器提出的基于DCNN的特征选择所获得的优异性能，使其成为与现有技术水平相比的快速且准确的分类器。
