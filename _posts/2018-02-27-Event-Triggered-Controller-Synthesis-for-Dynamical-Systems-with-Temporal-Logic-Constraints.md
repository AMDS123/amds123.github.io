##### Abstract
In this work, we propose an event-triggered con- trol framework for dynamical systems with temporal logical constraints. Event-triggered control methodologies have proven to be very efficient in reducing sensing, communication and computation costs. When a continuous feedback control is re- placed with an event-triggered strategy, the corresponding state trajectories also differ. In a system with logical constraints, such small deviation in the trajectory might lead to unsatisfiability of the logical constraints. In this work, we develop an approach where we ensure that the event-triggered state trajectory is confined within an tube of the ideal trajectory associated with the continuous state feedback. At the same time, we will ensure satisfiability of the logical constraints as well. Furthermore, we show that the proposed method works for delayed systems as long as the delay is bounded by a certain quantity.

在这项工作中，我们提出了一个具有时间逻辑约束的动态系统的事件触发控制框架。事件触发控制方法已被证明在降低传感，通信和计算成本方面非常有效。当用事件触发策略替换连续的反馈控制时，相应的状态轨迹也不同。在具有逻辑约束的系统中，轨迹中的这种小偏差可能导致逻辑约束的不可满足性。在这项工作中，我们开发了一种方法，确保事件触发状态轨迹被限制在与连续状态反馈相关的理想轨迹的管内。同时，我们也将确保逻辑约束的可满足性。此外，我们表明，只要延迟受到一定数量的限制，所提出的方法适用于延迟系统。
