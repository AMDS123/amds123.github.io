##### Abstract
This study introduces a connective model of routing- local path planning for Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV) time efficient maneuver in long-range operations. Assuming the vehicle operating in a turbulent underwater environment, the local path planner produces the water-current resilient shortest paths along the existent nodes in the global route. A re-routing procedure is defined to re-organize the order of nodes in a route and compensate any lost time during the mission. The Firefly Optimization Algorithm (FOA) is conducted by both of the planners to validate the model's performance in mission timing and its robustness against water current variations. Considering the limitation over the battery life time, the model offers an accurate mission timing and real-time performance. The routing system and the local path planner operate cooperatively, and this is another reason for model's real-time performance. The simulation results confirms the model's capability in fulfillment of the expected criterion and proves its significant robustness against underwater uncertainties and variations of the mission conditions.

本研究为远程操作中的自主水下航行器（AUV）时间有效机动引入了路线本地路径规划的连接模型。假设车辆在动荡的水下环境中运行，本地路径规划器在全球路线上沿着现有节点产生水流弹性最短路径。定义重新路由过程以重新组织路由中的节点的顺序并补偿在任务期间的任何丢失的时间。萤火虫优化算法（FOA）由两个规划者进行，以验证模型在任务时间的性能及其对水流变化的鲁棒性。考虑到电池续航时间的限制，该模型提供了准确的任务时间和实时性能。路由系统和本地路径规划器协同工作，这是模型实时性能的另一个原因。仿真结果证实了该模型在满足预期标准方面的能力，并证明了其对抗水下不确定性和任务条件变化的显着鲁棒性。
