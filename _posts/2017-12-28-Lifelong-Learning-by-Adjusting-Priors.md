##### Abstract
In representational lifelong learning an agent aims to learn to solve novel tasks while updating its representation in light of previous tasks. Under the assumption that future tasks are `related' to previous tasks, representations should be learned in such a way that they capture the common structure across learned tasks, while allowing the learner sufficient flexibility to adapt to novel aspects of a new task. We develop a framework for lifelong learning in deep neural networks that is based on generalization bounds, developed within the PAC-Bayes framework. Learning takes place through the construction of a distribution over networks based on the tasks seen so far, and its utilization for learning a new task. Thus, prior knowledge is incorporated through setting a history-dependent prior for novel tasks. We develop a gradient-based algorithm implementing these ideas, based on minimizing an objective function motivated by generalization bounds, and demonstrate its effectiveness through numerical examples.

在代表性终身学习中，代理人旨在学习解决新任务，同时根据以前的任务更新代表性任务。假设未来的任务与以前的任务“相关”，应该学习表示，以便捕捉学习任务的共同结构，同时让学习者有足够的灵活性来适应新任务的新方面。我们在深度神经网络中开发了一个基于PAC-Bayes框架内开发的泛化界限的终身学习框架。学习是通过基于迄今为止所看到的任务建立网络的分布，并将其用于学习新的任务来进行的。因此，先前的知识是通过设置新的任务的历史依赖先验而被合并的。基于最小化由泛化边界引发的目标函数，我们开发了基于梯度的算法来实现这些思想，并通过数值例子展示其有效性。
