##### Abstract
We propose a Historical Document Reading Challenge on Large Chinese Structured Family Records, in short ICDAR2019 HDRC CHINESE. The objective of the proposed competition is to recognize and analyze the layout, and finally detect and recognize the textlines and characters of the large historical document collection containing more than 20 000 pages kindly provided by FamilySearch.
