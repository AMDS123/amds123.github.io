##### Abstract
Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) learn filters in order to capture local correlation patterns in feature space. In contrast, in this paper we propose harmonic blocks that produce features by learning optimal combinations of spectral filters defined by the Discrete Cosine Transform. The harmonic blocks are used to replace conventional convolutional layers to construct partial or fully harmonic CNNs. We extensively validate our approach and show that the introduction of harmonic blocks into state-of-the-art CNN baseline architectures results in comparable or better performance in classification tasks on small NORB, CIFAR10 and CIFAR100 datasets.
