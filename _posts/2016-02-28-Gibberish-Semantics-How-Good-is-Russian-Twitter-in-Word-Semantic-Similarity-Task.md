##### Abstract
The most studied and most successful language models were developed and evaluated mainly for English and other close European languages, such as French, German, etc. It is important to study applicability of these models to other languages. The use of vector space models for Russian was recently studied for multiple corpora, such as Wikipedia, RuWac, lib.ru. These models were evaluated against word semantic similarity task. For our knowledge Twitter was not considered as a corpus for this task, with this work we fill the gap. Results for vectors trained on Twitter corpus are comparable in accuracy with other single-corpus trained models, although the best performance is currently achieved by combination of multiple corpora.

##### Abstract (translated by Google)
研究最多，最成功的语言模型主要是针对英语以及法语，德语等其他相近的欧洲语言进行开发和评估的。研究这些模型对其他语言的适用性非常重要。最近针对多个语料库（例如维基百科，RuWac，lib.ru）研究了俄语向量空间模型的使用。这些模型被评估反对词语义相似性任务。就我们所知，Twitter并不被视为这个任务的一个语料库，通过这项工作，我们填补了这个空白。在Twitter语料上训练的向量的结果与其他单语料库训练模型的准确度相当，尽管最好的性能目前是通过组合多个语料库来实现的。
