##### Abstract
Our work presented in this paper focuses on the translation of terminological expressions represented in semantically structured resources, like ontologies or knowledge graphs. The challenge of translating ontology labels or terminological expressions represented in knowledge bases lies in the highly specific vocabulary and the lack of contextual information, which can guide a machine translation system to translate ambiguous words into the targeted domain. Due to these challenges, we evaluate the translation quality of domain-specific expressions in the medical and financial domain with statistical (SMT) as well as with neural machine translation (NMT) methods and experiment domain adaptation of the translation models with terminological expressions only. Furthermore, we perform experiments on the injection of external terminological expressions into the translation systems. Through these experiments, we observed a significant advantage in domain adaptation for the domain-specific resource in the medical and financial domain and the benefit of subword models over word-based NMT models for terminology translation.
