##### Abstract
Representation learning is at the heart of what makes deep learning effective. In this work, we introduce a new framework for representation learning that we call "Holographic Neural Architectures" (HNAs). In the same way that an observer can experience the 3D structure of a holographed object by looking at its hologram from several angles, HNAs derive Holographic Representations from the training set. These representations can then be explored by moving along a continuous bounded single dimension. We show that HNAs can be used to make generative networks, state-of-the-art regression models and that they are inherently highly resistant to noise. Finally, we argue that because of their denoising abilities and their capacity to generalize well from very few examples, models based upon HNAs are particularly well suited for biological applications where training examples are rare or noisy.

表示学习是使深度学习有效的核心。在这项工作中，我们引入了一种新的表示学习框架，我们称之为“全息神经结构”（HNAs）。以同样的方式，观察者可以通过从多个角度观察其全息图来体验全息图物体的3D结构，HNA从训练集中获取全息图表示。这些表示可以通过沿着一个连续的有界单维移动来探索。我们证明HNA可以用来生成生成网络，最先进的回归模型，并且它们本质上对噪声具有高度抗性。最后，我们认为，由于它们的去噪能力以及从少数几个例子中很好地推广的能力，基于HNA的模型特别适合训练样例罕见或嘈杂的生物学应用。
