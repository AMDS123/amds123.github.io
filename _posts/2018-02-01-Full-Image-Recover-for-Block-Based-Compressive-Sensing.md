##### Abstract
Recent years, compressive sensing (CS) has improved greatly for the application of deep learning technology. For convenience, the input image is usually measured and reconstructed block by block. This usually causes block effect in reconstructed images. In this paper, we present a novel CNN-based network to solve this problem. In measurement part, the input image is adaptively measured block by block to acquire a group of measurements. While in reconstruction part, all the measurements from one image are used to reconstruct the full image at the same time. Different from previous method recovering block by block, the structure information destroyed in measurement part is recovered in our framework. Block effect is removed accordingly. We train the proposed framework by mean square error (MSE) loss function. Experiments show that there is no block effect at all in the proposed method. And our results outperform 1.8 dB compared with existing methods.

近年来，压缩感知（CS）在深度学习技术的应用上有了很大的提高。为了方便，输入图像通常是逐块测量和重建的。这通常会导致重建图像中的块效应。在本文中，我们提出了一种新颖的基于CNN的网络来解决这个问题。在测量部分，输入图像被自适应地逐块测量以获取一组测量值。而在重建部分，所有来自一个图像的测量值被用来同时重建全部图像。不同于以前的方法逐块恢复，在我们的框架中恢复了测量部分损坏的结构信息。块效应被相应地去除。我们通过均方误差（MSE）损失函数来训练所提出的框架。实验表明，该方法完全没有块效应。与现有方法相比，我们的结果优于1.8 dB。
