##### Abstract
Deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have achieved breakthrough performance in many pattern recognition tasks such as image classification. However, the development of high-quality deep models typically relies on a substantial amount of trial-and-error, as there is still no clear understanding of when and why a deep model works. In this paper, we present a visual analytics approach for better understanding, diagnosing, and refining deep CNNs. We formulate a deep CNN as a directed acyclic graph. Based on this formulation, a hybrid visualization is developed to disclose the multiple facets of each neuron and the interactions between them. In particular, we introduce a hierarchical rectangle packing algorithm and a matrix reordering algorithm to show the derived features of a neuron cluster. We also propose a biclustering-based edge bundling method to reduce visual clutter caused by a large number of connections between neurons. We evaluated our method on a set of CNNs and the results are generally favorable.

深卷积神经网络（CNN）在诸如图像分类等许多模式识别任务中取得了突破性的进展。然而，高质量深层模型的发展通常依赖于大量的试错，因为对于深层模型何时以及为何还没有清楚的理解。在本文中，我们提出了一个可视化分析方法，以更好地理解，诊断和提炼深度CNNs。我们将CNN作为一个有向无环图来制定。基于这个公式，混合可视化被开发来揭示每个神经元的多个方面和它们之间的相互作用。特别地，我们引入了一种分层矩形包装算法和一种矩阵重排序算法来显示神经元簇的派生特征。我们还提出了一种基于双聚类的边缘捆绑方法来减少神经元之间大量连接引起的视觉混乱。我们在一组CNN上评估了我们的方法，结果通常是有利的。
