##### Abstract
This paper presents an easy and efficient face detection and face recognition approach using free software components from the internet. Face detection and face recognition problems have wide applications in home and office security. Therefore this work will helpful for those searching for a free face off-the-shelf face detection system. Using this system, faces can be detected in uncontrolled environments. In the detection phase, every individual face is detected and in the recognition phase the detected faces are compared with the faces in a given data set and recognized.
