##### Abstract
Perception and reasoning are basic human abilities that are seamlessly connected as part of human intelligence. However, in current machine learning systems, the perception and reasoning modules are incompatible. Tasks requiring joint perception and reasoning ability are difficult to accomplish autonomously and still demand human intervention. Inspired by the way language experts decoded Mayan scripts by joining two abilities in an abductive manner, this paper proposes the abductive learning framework. The framework learns perception and reasoning simultaneously with the help of a trial-and-error abductive process. We present the Neural-Logical Machine as an implementation of this novel learning framework. We demonstrate that--using human-like abductive learning--the machine learns from a small set of simple hand-written equations and then generalizes well to complex equations, a feat that is beyond the capability of state-of-the-art neural network models. The abductive learning framework explores a new direction for approaching human-level learning ability.

感知和推理是作为人类智能的一部分无缝连接的基本人类能力。但是，在目前的机器学习系统中，感知和推理模块是不兼容的。需要联合认知和推理能力的任务难以自主完成，仍然需要人为干预。受到语言专家对玛雅脚本的两种能力的迷恋的解读，本文提出了一个诱人的学习框架。该框架通过反复试探的过程同时学习知觉和推理。我们提出神经逻辑机器作为这个新颖的学习框架的实施。我们证明 - 使用类似人类的外向性学习 - 机器从一小组简单的手写方程中学习，然后很好地将其推广到复杂的方程，这超出了现有技术神经的能力网络模型。诱人的学习框架探索了接近人类学习能力的新方向。
