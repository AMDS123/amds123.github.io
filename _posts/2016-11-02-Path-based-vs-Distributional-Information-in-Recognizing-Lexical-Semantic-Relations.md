##### Abstract
Recognizing various semantic relations between terms is beneficial for many NLP tasks. While path-based and distributional information sources are considered complementary for this task, the superior results the latter showed recently suggested that the former's contribution might have become obsolete. We follow the recent success of an integrated neural method for hypernymy detection (Shwartz et al., 2016) and extend it to recognize multiple relations. The empirical results show that this method is effective in the multiclass setting as well. We further show that the path-based information source always contributes to the classification, and analyze the cases in which it mostly complements the distributional information.

认识到术语之间的各种语义关系对许多NLP任务是有利的。虽然基于路径和分布的信息来源被认为是对这一任务的补充，但最近的结果表明，前者的贡献可能已经​​过时。我们遵循最近成功的一种综合神经方法检测超子（Shwartz等，2016），并将其扩展到识别多重关系。实证结果表明，这种方法在多分类设置中也是有效的。我们进一步表明，基于路径的信息源总是对分类做出贡献，并分析其中大部分对分布信息进行补充的情况。
