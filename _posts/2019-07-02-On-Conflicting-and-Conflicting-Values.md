##### Abstract
Values are things that are important to us. Actions activate values - they either go against our values or they promote our values. Values themselves can either be conforming or conflicting depending on the action that is taken. In this short paper, we argue that values may be classified as one of two types - conflicting and inherently conflicting values. They are distinguished by the fact that the latter in some sense can be thought of as being independent of actions. This allows us to do two things: i) check whether a set of values is consistent and ii) check whether it is in conflict with other sets of values.
