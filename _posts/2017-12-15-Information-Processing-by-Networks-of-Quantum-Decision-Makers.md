##### Abstract
We suggest a model of a multi-agent society of decision makers taking decisions being based on two criteria, one is the utility of the prospects and the other is the attractiveness of the considered prospects. The model is the generalization of quantum decision theory, developed earlier for single decision makers realizing one-step decisions, in two principal aspects. First, several decision makers are considered simultaneously, who interact with each other through information exchange. Second, a multistep procedure is treated, when the agents exchange information many times. Several decision makers exchanging information and forming their judgement, using quantum rules, form a kind of a quantum information network, where collective decisions develop in time as a result of information exchange. In addition to characterizing collective decisions that arise in human societies, such networks can describe dynamical processes occurring in artificial quantum intelligence composed of several parts or in a cluster of quantum computers. The practical usage of the theory is illustrated on the dynamic disjunction effect for which three quantitative predictions are made: (i) the probabilistic behavior of decision makers at the initial stage of the process is described; (ii) the decrease of the difference between the initial prospect probabilities and the related utility factors is proved; (iii) the existence of a common consensus after multiple exchange of information is predicted. The predicted numerical values are in very good agreement with empirical data.

我们建议决策者作出基于两个标准作出决定的多主体社会模型，一个是前景的效用，另一个是所考虑的前景的吸引力。该模型是量子决策理论的推广，早在单个决策者实现一步决策时就发展了两个主要方面。首先，同时考虑几个决策者，他们通过信息交换相互交流。其次，当代理人多次交换信息时，多级程序被处理。一些决策者利用量子规则交换信息和形成判断，形成一种量子信息网络，信息交换的结果是集体决策及时发展。除了表征人类社会中出现的集体决策之外，这样的网络还可以描述在量子计算机中由多个部分组成的人工量子智能中发生的动态过程。该理论的实际用法说明了三种定量预测的动态分离效应：（i）描述了决策者在过程初期的概率行为; （2）证明了初始前景概率与相关效用因子之间差异的减小; （iii）预测多次信息交换后存在共识。预测的数值与经验数据非常吻合。
