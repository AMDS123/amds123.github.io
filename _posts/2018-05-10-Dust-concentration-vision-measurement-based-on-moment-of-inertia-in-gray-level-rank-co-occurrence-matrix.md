##### Abstract
To improve the accuracy of existing dust concentration measurements, a dust concentration measurement based on Moment of inertia in Gray level-Rank Co-occurrence Matrix (GRCM), which is from the dust image sample measured by a machine vision system is proposed in this paper. Firstly, a Polynomial computational model between dust Concentration and Moment of inertia (PCM) is established by experimental methods and fitting methods. Then computing methods for GRCM and its Moment of inertia are constructed by theoretical and mathematical analysis methods. And then developing an on-line dust concentration vision measurement experimental system, the cement dust concentration measurement in a cement production workshop is taken as a practice example with the system and the PCM measurement. The results show that measurement error is within 9%, and the measurement range is 0.5-1000 mg/m3. Finally, comparing with the filter membrane weighing measurement, light scattering measurement and laser measurement, the proposed PCM measurement has advantages on error and cost, which can be provided a valuable reference for the dust concentration vision measurements.

为了提高现有粉尘浓度测量的准确性，本文提出了基于机械视觉系统测量的灰尘图像样本的基于灰度级别共生矩阵（GRCM）中惯性矩的粉尘浓度测量方法。 。首先，通过实验方法和拟合方法建立了灰尘浓度与惯性矩之间的多项式计算模型。然后，通过理论和数学分析方法构建GRCM及其惯性矩计算方法。然后开发在线粉尘浓度视觉测量实验系统，以水泥生产车间的水泥粉尘浓度测量为例进行系统和PCM测量。结果表明测量误差在9％以内，测量范围为0.5-1000 mg / m3。最后，与过滤膜称重测量，光散射测量和激光测量相比，所提出的PCM测量方法在误差和成本方面具有优势，可为粉尘浓度视觉测量提供有价值的参考。
