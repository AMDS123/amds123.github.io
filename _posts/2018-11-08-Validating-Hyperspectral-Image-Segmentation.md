##### Abstract
Hyperspectral satellite imaging attracts enormous research attention in the remote sensing community, hence automated approaches for precise segmentation of such imagery are being rapidly developed. In this letter, we share our observations on the strategy for validating hyperspectral image segmentation algorithms currently followed in the literature, and show that it can lead to over-optimistic experimental insights. We introduce a new routine for generating segmentation benchmarks, and use it to elaborate ready-to-use hyperspectral training-test data partitions. They can be utilized for fair validation of new and existing algorithms without any training-test data leakage.
