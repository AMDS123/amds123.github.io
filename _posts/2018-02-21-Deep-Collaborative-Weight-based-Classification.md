##### Abstract
One of the biggest problems in deep learning is its difficulty to retain consistent robustness when transferring the model trained on one dataset to another dataset. To conquer the problem, deep transfer learning was implemented to execute various vision tasks by using a pre-trained deep model in a diverse dataset. However, the robustness was often far from state-of-the-art. We propose a collaborative weight-based classification method for deep transfer learning (DeepCWC). The method performs the L2-norm based collaborative representation on the original images, as well as the deep features extracted by pre-trained deep models. Two distance vectors will be obtained based on the two representation coefficients, and then fused together via the collaborative weight. The two feature sets show a complementary character, and the original images provide information compensating the missed part in the transferred deep model. A series of experiments conducted on both small and large vision datasets demonstrated the robustness of the proposed DeepCWC in both face recognition and object recognition tasks.

在深度学习中最大的问题之一是难以在将一个数据集上训练的模型转移到另一个数据集时保持一致的鲁棒性。为了克服这个问题，通过在不同的数据集中使用预先训练的深度模型来实施深度转移学习以执行各种视觉任务。然而，这种稳健性往往远非最先进的。我们提出了一种深度转移学习的协同权重分类方法（DeepCWC）。该方法在原始图像上执行基于L2范数的协作表示，以及由预先训练的深度模型提取的深度特征。两个距离矢量将基于这两个表示系数获得，然后通过合作权重融合在一起。这两个特征集表现出互补性，并且原始图像提供补偿转移的深层模型中的缺失部分的信息。在小型和大型视觉数据集上进行的一系列实验证明了DeepCWC在人脸识别和物体识别任务中的稳健性。
