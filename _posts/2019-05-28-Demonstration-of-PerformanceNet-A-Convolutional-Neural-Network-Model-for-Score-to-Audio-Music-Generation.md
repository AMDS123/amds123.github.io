##### Abstract
We present in this paper PerformacnceNet, a neural network model we proposed recently to achieve score-to-audio music generation. The model learns to convert a music piece from the symbolic domain to the audio domain, assigning performance-level attributes such as changes in velocity automatically to the music and then synthesizing the audio. The model is therefore not just a neural audio synthesizer, but an AI performer that learns to interpret a musical score in its own way. The code and sample outputs of the model can be found online at this https URL.
