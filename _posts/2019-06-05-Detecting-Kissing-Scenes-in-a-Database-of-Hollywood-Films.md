##### Abstract
Detecting scene types in a movie can be very useful for application such as video editing, ratings assignment, and personalization. We propose a system for detecting kissing scenes in a movie. This system consists of two components. The first component is a binary classifier that predicts a binary label (i.e. kissing or not) given a features exctracted from both the still frames and audio waves of a one-second segment. The second component aggregates the binary labels for contiguous non-overlapping segments into a set of kissing scenes. We experimented with a variety of 2D and 3D convolutional architectures such as ResNet, DesnseNet, and VGGish and developed a highly accurate kissing detector that achieves a validation F1 score of 0.95 on a diverse database of Hollywood films ranging many genres and spanning multiple decades. The code for this project is available at <a href="http://github.com/amirziai/kissing-detector.">this http URL</a>
