##### Abstract
Underwater images suffer from extremely unfavourable conditions. Light is heavily attenuated and scattered. Attenuation creates change in hue, scattering causes so called veiling light. General state of the art methods for enhancing image quality are either unreliable or cannot be easily used in underwater operations. On the other hand there is a well known method for haze removal in air, called Dark Channel Prior. Even though there are known adaptations of this method to underwater applications, they do not always work correctly. This work elaborates and improves upon the initial concept presented in [1]. A modification to the Dark Channel Prior is proposed that allows for an easy application to underwater images. It is also shown that our method outperforms competing solutions based on the Dark Channel Prior. Experiments on real-life data collected within the DexROV project are also presented, showing the robustness and high performance of the proposed algorithm.

水下图像受到极端不利条件的影响。光被严重衰减和散射。衰减会产生色调变化，散射会导致所谓的遮蔽光。用于增强图像质量的一般现有技术方法要么不可靠，要么不能容易地用于水下操作。另一方面，有一种众所周知的在空气中去除雾度的方法，称为Dark Channel Prior。即使已知这种方法适用于水下应用，但它们并不总能正常工作。这项工作阐述并改进了[1]中提出的初始概念。提出了对Dark Channel Prior的修改，其允许容易地应用于水下图像。还表明我们的方法优于基于Dark Channel Prior的竞争解决方案。还介绍了在DexROV项目中收集的实际数据的实验，显示了所提算法的鲁棒性和高性能。
