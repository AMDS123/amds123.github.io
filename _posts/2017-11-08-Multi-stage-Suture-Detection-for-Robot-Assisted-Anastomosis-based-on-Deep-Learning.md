##### Abstract
In robotic surgery, task automation and learning from demonstration combined with human supervision is an emerging trend for many new surgical robot platforms. One such task is automated anastomosis, which requires bimanual needle handling and suture detection. Due to the complexity of the surgical environment and varying patient anatomies, reliable suture detection is difficult, which is further complicated by occlusion and thread topologies. In this paper, we propose a multi-stage framework for suture thread detection based on deep learning. Fully convolutional neural networks are used to obtain the initial detection and the overlapping status of suture thread, which are later fused with the original image to learn a gradient road map of the thread. Based on the gradient road map, multiple segments of the thread are extracted and linked to form the whole thread using a curvilinear structure detector. Experiments on two different types of sutures demonstrate the accuracy of the proposed framework.

在机器人手术中，任务自动化和示范学习相结合的人体监督是许多新型手术机器人平台的一个新兴趋势。一个这样的任务是自动吻合，这需要双手的针处理和缝合检测。由于手术环境的复杂性和不同的患者解剖结构，可靠的缝线检测是困难的，并且由于闭塞和螺纹拓扑而进一步复杂化。在本文中，我们提出了一个基于深度学习的多阶段缝合线检测框架。完全卷积神经网络用于获得缝合线的初始检测和重叠状态，后者与原始图像融合，以学习线程的梯度路线图。基于梯度路线图，使用曲线结构检测器提取并链接多个线段以形成整个线程。两种不同类型的缝合的实验证明了所提出的框架的准确性。
