##### Abstract
Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has been proposed as a complimentary method to measure bone quality and assess fracture risk. However, manual segmentation of MR images of bone is time-consuming, limiting the use of MRI measurements in the clinical practice. The purpose of this paper is to present an automatic proximal femur segmentation method that is based on deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs). This study had institutional review board approval and written informed consent was obtained from all subjects. A dataset of volumetric structural MR images of the proximal femur from 86 subject were manually-segmented by an expert. We performed experiments by training two different CNN architectures with multiple number of initial feature maps and layers, and tested their segmentation performance against the gold standard of manual segmentations using four-fold cross-validation. Automatic segmentation of the proximal femur achieved a high dice similarity score of 0.94$\pm$0.05 with precision = 0.95$\pm$0.02, and recall = 0.94$\pm$0.08 using a CNN architecture based on 3D convolution exceeding the performance of 2D CNNs. The high segmentation accuracy provided by CNNs has the potential to help bring the use of structural MRI measurements of bone quality into clinical practice for management of osteoporosis.

已经提出将磁共振成像（MRI）作为测量骨质量和评估骨折风险的补充方法。然而，手动分割骨骼的MR图像是耗时的，限制了在临床实践中使用MRI测量。本文的目的是提出一种基于深度卷积神经网络（CNN）的自动近端股骨分割方法。这项研究有机构审查委员会的批准，并从所有科目获得书面知情同意。来自86个受试者的股骨近端的体积结构MR图像的数据集由专家手动分割。我们通过训练两个不同的CNN体​​系结构，并使用多个初始特征图和图层进行实验，并使用四重交叉验证对照手动分割的黄金标准测试其分割性能。使用基于3D卷积的CNN体​​系结构，超过2D CNN的性能，自动分割股骨近端获得0.94 $ \ pm $ 0.05的高骰子相似性得分，精确度= 0.95 $ \ pm $ 0.02，回忆= 0.94 $ \ pm $ 0.08。由CNN提供的高分割准确性有助于将骨质量的结构MRI测量结果应用到骨质疏松症治疗的临床实践中。
