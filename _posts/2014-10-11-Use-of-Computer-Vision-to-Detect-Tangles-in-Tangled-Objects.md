##### Abstract
Untangling of structures like ropes and wires by autonomous robots can be useful in areas such as personal robotics, industries and electrical wiring & repairing by robots. This problem can be tackled by using computer vision system in robot. This paper proposes a computer vision based method for analyzing visual data acquired from camera for perceiving the overlap of wires, ropes, hoses i.e. detecting tangles. Information obtained after processing image according to the proposed method comprises of position of tangles in tangled object and which wire passes over which wire. This information can then be used to guide robot to untangle wire/s. Given an image, preprocessing is done to remove noise. Then edges of wire are detected. After that, the image is divided into smaller blocks and each block is checked for wire overlap/s and finding other relevant information. TANGLED-100 dataset was introduced, which consists of images of tangled linear deformable objects. Method discussed in here was tested on the TANGLED-100 dataset. Accuracy achieved during experiments was found to be 74.9%. Robotic simulations were carried out to demonstrate the use of the proposed method in applications of robot. Proposed method is a general method that can be used by robots working in different situations.

通过自主机器人解开绳索和电线等结构，可以在个人机器人，工业和机器人的电线和修理等领域发挥作用。这个问题可以通过在机器人中使用计算机视觉系统来解决。本文提出了一种基于计算机视觉的方法，用于分析从摄像机获取的视觉数据，以感知电线，绳索，软管即检测到缠结的重叠。根据所提出的方法在处理图像之后获得的信息包括缠结物体中缠结的位置以及哪根线穿过哪根线。这些信息可以用来引导机器人来解开导线。给定一个图像，预处理完成，以消除噪音。然后检测导线的边缘。之后，将图像分成较小的块，并检查每个块重叠/ s并找到其他相关信息。介绍了TANGLED-100数据集，该数据集由缠结的线性变形物体的图像组成。在这里讨论的方法在TANGLED-100数据集上进行了测试。实验中达到的准确度为74.9％。机器人仿真进行了展示使用提出的方法在机器人的应用。提出的方法是机器人在不同情况下使用的一般方法。
