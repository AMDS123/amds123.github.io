##### Abstract
The presentations in the 2nd Hellenic Cosmology Workshop covered a broad range of cosmological subjects. Following the analogy with the architectural masters of Ancient Greece, the contributions are presented in ``architectural'' sessions. The session on the ``Architects'' involves ``fundamental cosmology'', focussing on the topology and geometry of our Universe and the fundamental physical laws and processes at work in the first decisive moments of the (Very) Early Universe. Following these cosmic blueprints, the ``Constructors'' set out to present the ultimate realization of the cosmic framework. This concerns the search for the best available estimates of the parameters characterizing the Friedmann-Robertson-Walker metric. The specification of these cosmic measures paves the way for the ``Interior Decorators'' to take care of the cosmic ``Infrastructure''. This involves the patterns and morphology of Megaparsec scale cosmic structure and its emergence through gravitational instability, as well as aspects concerning the rise of galaxies through the complex interplay of gravitational, hydrodynamic, radiative, stellar and other dissipative processes.
