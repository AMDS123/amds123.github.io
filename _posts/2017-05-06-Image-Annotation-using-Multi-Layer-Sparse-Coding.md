##### Abstract
Automatic annotation of images with descriptive words is a challenging problem with vast applications in the areas of image search and retrieval. This problem can be viewed as a label-assignment problem by a classifier dealing with a very large set of labels, i.e., the vocabulary set. We propose a novel annotation method that employs two layers of sparse coding and performs coarse-to-fine labeling. Themes extracted from the training data are treated as coarse labels. Each theme is a set of training images that share a common subject in their visual and textual contents. Our system extracts coarse labels for training and test images without requiring any prior knowledge. Vocabulary words are the fine labels to be associated with images. Most of the annotation methods achieve low recall due to the large number of available fine labels, i.e., vocabulary words. These systems also tend to achieve high precision for highly frequent words only while relatively rare words are more important for search and retrieval purposes. Our system not only outperforms various previously proposed annotation systems, but also achieves symmetric response in terms of precision and recall. Our system scores and maintains high precision for words with a wide range of frequencies. Such behavior is achieved by intelligently reducing the number of available fine labels or words for each image based on coarse labels assigned to it.

在图像搜索和检索领域中，用描述性词语自动注释图像是一个具有挑战性的问题，具有广泛的应用。这个问题可以被分类器看作是一个标签分配问题，这个分类器处理一个非常大的标签集，即词汇集。我们提出了一种新的注释方法，采用两层稀疏编码，并执行从粗到细的标记。从训练数据中提取的主题被视为粗略标签。每个主题都是一组训练图像，在视觉和文本内容中共享一个共同主题。我们的系统提取粗糙的标签用于训练和测试图像，而不需要任何预先知识词汇单词是与图像相关的优良标签。由于大量可用的精细标签，即词汇单词，大多数注释方法实现低回忆。这些系统也倾向于为高度频繁的单词实现高精度，而相对罕见的单词对于搜索和检索目的更重要。我们的系统不仅比以前提出的各种注释系统更胜一筹，而且在精确度和召回率方面也达到了对称响应。我们的系统对频率范围广泛的文字进行分数计算并保持高精度。这种行为是通过智能地减少基于分配给它的粗糙标签的每个图像的可用精细标签或字的数量来实现的。
