##### Abstract
We present a model for the time evolution of network architectures based on dynamical systems. We show that the evolution of the existence of a connection in a network can be described as a stochastic non-markovian telegraphic signal (NMTS). Such signal is formulated in two ways: as an algorithm and as the result of a system of differential equations. The autonomous learning conjecture [Phys. Rev. E \textbf{90},030901(R) (2014)] is implemented in the proposed dynamics. As a result, we construct self-organizing dynamical systems (networks) able to modify their structures in order to learn prescribed target functionalities. This theory is applied to two systems: the flow processing networks with time-programmed responses, and a system of first-order chemical reactions. In both cases, we show examples of the evolution and a statistical analysis of the obtained functional networks with respect to the model parameters.
