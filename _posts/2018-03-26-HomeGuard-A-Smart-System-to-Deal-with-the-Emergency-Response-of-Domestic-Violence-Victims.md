##### Abstract
Domestic violence is a silent crisis in the developing and underdeveloped countries, though developed countries also remain drowned in the curse of it. In developed countries, victims can easily report and ask help on the contrary in developing and underdeveloped countries victims hardly report the crimes and when it's noticed by the authority it's become too late to save or support the victim. If this kind of problems can be identified at the very beginning of the event and proper actions can be taken, it'll not only help the victim but also reduce the domestic violence crimes. This paper proposed a smart system which can extract victim's situation and provide help according to it. Among of the developing and underdeveloped countries Bangladesh has been chosen though the rate of reporting of domestic violence is low, the extreme report collected by authorities is too high. Case studies collected by different NGO's relating to domestic violence have been studied and applied to extract possible condition for the victims.

##### Abstract (translated by Google)
家庭暴力是发展中国家和不发达国家的沉默危机，尽管发达国家也依然受到诅咒。在发达国家，受害者可以很容易地向发展中国家和欠发达国家报告并寻求帮助，受害者几乎不会报告犯罪情况，并且在当局注意到救助或支持受害者已经太迟了。如果在事件发生的一开始就能确定这类问题，并采取适当的行动，这不仅可以帮助受害者，还可以减少家庭暴力犯罪。本文提出了一个智能系统，可以根据这个智能系统提取受害者的情况并提供帮助。在发展中国家和不发达国家中，虽然家庭暴力报告率较低，但孟加拉国已被选中，但当局收集的极端报告太高。不同的非政府组织收集的有关家庭暴力的案例研究已经被研究并应用于为受害者提供可能的条件。
