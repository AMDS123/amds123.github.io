##### Abstract
Understanding physical phenomena is a key competence that enables humans and animals to act and interact under uncertain perception in previously unseen environments containing novel objects and their configurations. Developmental psychology has shown that such skills are acquired by infants from observations at a very early stage. In this paper, we contrast a more traditional approach of taking a model-based route with explicit 3D representations and physical simulation by an {\em end-to-end} approach that directly predicts stability from appearance. We ask the question if and to what extent and quality such a skill can directly be acquired in a data-driven way---bypassing the need for an explicit simulation at run-time. We present a learning-based approach based on simulated data that predicts stability of towers comprised of wooden blocks under different conditions and quantities related to the potential fall of the towers. We first evaluate the approach on synthetic data and compared the results to human judgments on the same stimuli. Further, we extend this approach to reason about future states of such towers that in turn enables successful stacking.

理解物理现象是一个关键的能力，使人类和动物能够在以前看不见的环境中，在包含新物体和它们的配置的不确定感知下行动和相互作用。发育心理学表明，这种技能是在很早的阶段由观察婴儿获得的。在本文中，我们比较了一种更传统的方法，即采用基于模型的路线与明确的3D表示和物理模拟，采用直接从外观预测稳定性的{端对端}方法。我们问这样一个问题，是否以及以何种程度和质量直接以数据驱动的方式获得这种技能 - 绕开运行时需要进行明确的模拟。我们提出了一种基于模拟数据的基于学习的方法，该模拟数据预测在不同的条件和数量的木块组成的塔的稳定性与塔的潜在的秋天有关。我们首先评估合成数据的方法，并将结果与​​人类对相同刺激的判断进行比较。此外，我们将这种方法扩展到对这样的塔的未来状态的原因，从而实现成功的堆叠。
