##### Abstract
Imaging-based, non-contact measurement of physiology (including imaging photoplethysmography and imaging ballistocardiography) is a growing field of research. There are several strengths of imaging methods that make them attractive. They remove the need for uncomfortable contact sensors and can enable spatial and concomitant measurement from a single sensor. Furthermore, cameras are ubiquitous and often low-cost solutions for sensing. Open source toolboxes help accelerate the progress of research by providing a means to compare new approaches against standard implementations of the state-of-the-art. We present an open source imaging-based physiological measurement toolbox with implementations of many of the most frequently employed computational methods. We hope that this toolbox will contribute to the advancement of non-contact physiological sensing methods.
