##### Abstract
Agglutinative languages such as Turkish, Finnish and Hungarian require morphological disambiguation before further processing due to the complex morphology of words. A morphological disambiguator is used to select the correct morphological analysis of a word. Morphological disambiguation is important because it generally is one of the first steps of natural language processing and its performance affects subsequent analyses. In this paper, we propose a system that uses deep learning techniques for morphological disambiguation. Many of the state-of-the-art results in computer vision, speech recognition and natural language processing have been obtained through deep learning models. However, applying deep learning techniques to morphologically rich languages is not well studied. In this work, while we focus on Turkish morphological disambiguation we also present results for French and German in order to show that the proposed architecture achieves high accuracy with no language-specific feature engineering or additional resource. In the experiments, we achieve 84.12, 88.35 and 93.78 morphological disambiguation accuracy among the ambiguous words for Turkish, German and French respectively.

像土耳其语，芬兰语和匈牙利语等混合语言由于词汇的复杂形态，在进一步处理之前需要进行形态学消歧。形态消歧器被用来选择一个单词的正确形态分析。形态学消歧是重要的，因为它通常是自然语言处理的第一步之一，其性能影响后续的分析。在本文中，我们提出了一个使用深度学习技术进行形态消歧的系统。计算机视觉，语音识别和自然语言处理方面的许多最新成果已通过深度学习模式获得。然而，将深度学习技术应用于形态丰富的语言还没有得到很好的研究。在这项工作中，虽然我们专注于土耳其形态消歧，但是我们也展示了法语和德语的结果，以显示所提出的体系结构在没有特定于语言的特征工程或额外资源的情况下实现了高准确性。在实验中，土耳其语，德语和法语的歧义词分别达到了84.12，88.35和93.78的形态歧义准确率。
