##### Abstract
In this paper, we propose a spectral-spatial feature extraction and classification framework based on artificial neuron network (ANN) in the context of hyperspectral imagery. With limited labeled samples, only spectral information is exploited for training and spatial context is integrated posteriorly at the testing stage. Taking advantage of recent advances in face recognition, a joint supervision symbol that combines softmax loss and center loss is adopted to train the proposed network, by which intra-class features are gathered while inter-class variations are enlarged. Based on the learned architecture, the extracted spectrum-based features are classified by a center classifier. Moreover, to fuse the spectral and spatial information, an adaptive spectral-spatial center classifier is developed, where multiscale neighborhoods are considered simultaneously, and the final label is determined using an adaptive voting strategy. Finally, experimental results on three well-known datasets validate the effectiveness of the proposed methods compared with the state-of-the-art approaches.

本文提出了一种基于人工神经网络（ANN）的光谱空间特征提取和分类框架。对于有限的标记样本，只有光谱信息被用于训练，空间上下文在测试阶段被整合。利用人脸识别技术的最新进展，采用结合softmax损失和中心损失的联合监督符号对提出的网络进行训练，通过该网络收集课堂特征，扩大课堂间的差异。基于学习的体系结构，提取的基于频谱的特征被中心分类器分类。此外，为了融合频谱和空间信息，开发了自适应频谱空间中心分类器，其中多尺度邻域被同时考虑，并且最终标签使用自适应投票策略来确定。最后，三个众所周知的数据集上的实验结果证明了所提出的方法与最先进的方法相比的有效性。
