##### Abstract
Deep reinforcement learning has seen great success across a breadth of tasks such as in game playing and robotic manipulation. However, the modern practice of attempting to learn tabula rasa disregards the logical structure of many domains and the wealth of readily-available human domain experts' knowledge that could help ``warm start'' the learning process. Further, learning from demonstration techniques are not yet sufficient to infer this knowledge through sampling-based mechanisms in large state and action spaces, or require immense amounts of data. We present a new reinforcement learning architecture that can encode expert knowledge, in the form of propositional logic, directly into a neural, tree-like structure of fuzzy propositions that are amenable to gradient descent. We show that our novel architecture is able to outperform reinforcement and imitation learning techniques across an array of canonical challenge problems for artificial intelligence.
