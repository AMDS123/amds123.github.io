##### Abstract
This work explores the problem of exercise quality measurement since it is essential for effective management of diseases like cerebral palsy (CP). This work examines the assessment of quality of large amplitude movement (LAM) exercises designed to treat CP in an automated fashion. Exercise data was collected by trained participants to generate ideal examples to use as a positive samples for machine learning. Following that, subjects were asked to deliberately make subtle errors during the exercise, such as restricting movements, as is commonly seen in cases of patients suffering from CP. The quality measurement problem was then posed as a classification to determine whether an example exercise was either "good" or "bad". Popular machine learning techniques for classification, including support vector machines (SVM), single and doublelayered neural networks (NN), boosted decision trees, and dynamic time warping (DTW), were compared. The AdaBoosted tree performed best with an accuracy of 94.68% demonstrating the feasibility of assessing exercise quality.

这项工作探讨了运动质量测量的问题，因为它是脑瘫（CP）等疾病的有效管理的关键。这项工作审查了大幅度运动（LAM）练习的质量评估，旨在以自动化的方式治疗CP。运动数据由受过训练的参与者收集，生成理想的例子，用作机器学习的正面样本。之后，受试者被要求在锻炼期间刻意地犯下微妙的错误，例如限制移动，如在患有CP的患者中经常见到的。然后将质量测量问题作为一个分类来确定示例练习是“好”还是“坏”。比较了支持向量机（SVM），单层和双层神经网络（NN），推动决策树和动态时间规整（DTW）等常用的分类机器学习技术。 AdaBoosted树表现最好，准确性为94.68％，证明了评估运动质量的可行性。
