##### Abstract
We consider the problem of estimating repetition in video, such as performing push-ups, cutting a melon or playing violin. Existing work shows good results under the assumption of static and stationary periodicity. As realistic video is rarely perfectly static and stationary, the often preferred Fourier-based measurements is inapt. Instead, we adopt the wavelet transform to better handle non-static and non-stationary video dynamics. From the flow field and its differentials, we derive three fundamental motion types and three motion continuities of intrinsic periodicity in 3D. On top of this, the 2D perception of 3D periodicity considers two extreme viewpoints. What follows are 18 fundamental cases of recurrent perception in 2D. In practice, to deal with the variety of repetitive appearance, our theory implies measuring time-varying flow and its differentials (gradient, divergence and curl) over segmented foreground motion. For experiments, we introduce the new QUVA Repetition dataset, reflecting reality by including non-static and non-stationary videos. On the task of counting repetitions in video, we obtain favorable results compared to a deep learning alternative.

我们考虑估计视频中的重复问题，比如进行俯卧撑，切瓜或拉小提琴。现有工作在静态和静态周期假设下显示出良好的结果。由于逼真的视频几乎不是完美的静态和静止的，通常优选的基于傅里叶的测量不适用。相反，我们采用小波变换来更好地处理非静态和非静态视频动态。从流场及其差分出发，我们推导出三维基本运动类型和三维内在周期性运动连续性。除此之外，3D周期性的2D感知考虑了两个极端的观点。接下来的是二维中18个经常感知的基本情况。在实践中，为了处理各种重复的外观，我们的理论意味着测量时变流动及其在分段前景运动上的差异（梯度，散度和卷曲）。对于实验，我们介绍新的QUVA重复数据集，通过包含非静态和非静态视频来反映真实情况。在计算视频重复的任务中，与深度学习的选择相比，我们获得了有利的结果。
