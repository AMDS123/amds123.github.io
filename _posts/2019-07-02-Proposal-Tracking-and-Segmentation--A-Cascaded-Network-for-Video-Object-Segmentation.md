##### Abstract
Video object segmentation (VOS) aims at pixel-level object tracking given only the annotations in the first frame. Due to the large visual variations of objects in video and the lack of training samples, it remains a difficult task despite the upsurging development of deep learning. Toward solving the VOS problem, we bring in several new insights by the proposed unified framework consisting of object proposal, tracking and segmentation components. The object proposal network transfers objectness information as generic knowledge into VOS; the tracking network identifies the target object from the proposals; and the segmentation network is performed based on the tracking results with a novel dynamic-reference based model adaptation scheme. Extensive experiments have been conducted on the DAVIS'17 dataset and the YouTube-VOS dataset, our method achieves the state-of-the-art performance on several video object segmentation benchmarks. We make the code publicly available at https://github.com/sydney0zq/PTSNet.
