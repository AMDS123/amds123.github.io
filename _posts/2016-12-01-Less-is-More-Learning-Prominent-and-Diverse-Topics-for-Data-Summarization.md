##### Abstract
Statistical topic models efficiently facilitate the exploration of large-scale data sets. Many models have been developed and broadly used to summarize the semantic structure in news, science, social media, and digital humanities. However, a common and practical objective in data exploration tasks is not to enumerate all existing topics, but to quickly extract representative ones that broadly cover the content of the corpus, i.e., a few topics that serve as a good summary of the data. Most existing topic models fit exactly the same number of topics as a user specifies, which have imposed an unnecessary burden to the users who have limited prior knowledge. We instead propose new models that are able to learn fewer but more representative topics for the purpose of data summarization. We propose a reinforced random walk that allows prominent topics to absorb tokens from similar and smaller topics, thus enhances the diversity among the top topics extracted. With this reinforced random walk as a general process embedded in classical topic models, we obtain \textit{diverse topic models} that are able to extract the most prominent and diverse topics from data. The inference procedures of these diverse topic models remain as simple and efficient as the classical models. Experimental results demonstrate that the diverse topic models not only discover topics that better summarize the data, but also require minimal prior knowledge of the users.

统计主题模型有效地促进了大规模数据集的探索。许多模型已经被开发出来，被广泛地用来总结新闻，科学，社交媒体和数字人文学的语义结构。然而，数据探索任务中一个普遍而实际的目标并不是要列举所有现有的主题，而是要快速提取广泛涵盖语料库内容的代表性主题，即作为数据良好总结的一些主题。大多数现有的主题模型与用户指定的主题数量完全相同，这对于具有有限的先验知识的用户施加了不必要的负担。相反，我们提出了新的模型，能够为数据总结学习更少但更具代表性的主题。我们提出了一个强化的随机游走，允许突出话题吸收来自类似和较小话题的令牌，从而增强提取的热门话题的多样性。通过这种增强的随机游走作为嵌入经典主题模型中的一般过程，我们获得了能够从数据中提取最突出和多样的主题的\多样化主题模型。这些不同主题模型的推理过程与经典模型一样简单高效。实验结果表明，不同的话题模型不仅发现了更好地总结数据的话题，而且还要求对用户的先验知识最少。
