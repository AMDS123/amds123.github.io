##### Abstract
This paper contains analysis of main modern approaches to dynamic code generation, in particular generation of new classes of objects during program execution. The main attention was paid to universal exploiters of homogeneous classes of objects, which were proposed as a part of such knowledge representation model as object-oriented dynamic networks, as the tools for generation of new classes of objects in program runtime. As the result, algorithms for implementation of such universal exploiters of classes of objects as union, intersection, difference and symmetric difference were developed. These algorithms can be used knowledge-based intelligent systems, which are based on object-oriented dynamic networks, and they can be adapted for some object-oriented programming languages with powerful metaprogramming opportunities.
