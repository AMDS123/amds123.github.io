##### Abstract
Face authentication systems are becoming increasingly prevalent, especially with the rapid development of Deep Learning technologies. However, human facial information is easy to be captured and reproduced, which makes face authentication systems vulnerable to various attacks. Liveness detection is an important defense technique to prevent such attacks, but existing solutions did not provide clear and strong security guarantees, especially in terms of time. 
 To overcome these limitations, we propose a new liveness detection protocol called Face Flashing that significantly increases the bar for launching successful attacks on face authentication systems. By randomly flashing well-designed pictures on a screen and analyzing the reflected light, our protocol has leveraged physical characteristics of human faces: reflection processing at the speed of light, unique textual features, and uneven 3D shapes. Cooperating with working mechanism of the screen and digital cameras, our protocol is able to detect subtle traces left by an attacking process. 
 To demonstrate the effectiveness of Face Flashing, we implemented a prototype and performed thorough evaluations with large data set collected from real-world scenarios. The results show that our Timing Verification can effectively detect the time gap between legitimate authentications and malicious cases. Our Face Verification can also differentiate 2D plane from 3D objects accurately. The overall accuracy of our liveness detection system is 98.8\%, and its robustness was evaluated in different scenarios. In the worst case, our system's accuracy decreased to a still-high 97.3\%.

面部认证系统正变得越来越普遍，特别是随着深度学习技术的快速发展。然而，人脸信息易于被捕获和再现，这使得面部认证系统易受各种攻击。活动检测是防止此类攻击的重要防御技术，但现有解决方案并未提供明确而强大的安全保障，尤其是在时间方面。
 为了克服这些限制，我们提出了一种新的活动检测协议，称为Face Flashing，它显着增加了在面部认证系统上启动成功攻击的标准。通过在屏幕上随意闪烁精心设计的图片并分析反射光，我们的协议利用了人脸的物理特性：光速下的反射处理，独特的文本特征和不均匀的3D形状。通过与屏幕和数码相机的工作机制配合，我们的协议能够检测攻击过程留下的细微痕迹。
 为了证明Face Flashing的有效性，我们实现了一个原型，并对从实际场景中收集的大量数据集进行了全面的评估。结果表明，我们的时序验证可以有效地检测合法身份验证与恶意案件之间的时间差距。我们的面部验证还可以准确地区分2D平面和3D对象。我们的活体检测系统的整体精度为98.8％，并且在不同情况下评估其稳健性。在最坏的情况下，我们的系统的准确度降低到仍然高达97.3％。
