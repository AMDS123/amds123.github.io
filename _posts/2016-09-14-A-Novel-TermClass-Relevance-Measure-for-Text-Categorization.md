##### Abstract
In this paper, we introduce a new measure called Term_Class relevance to compute the relevancy of a term in classifying a document into a particular class. The proposed measure estimates the degree of relevance of a given term, in placing an unlabeled document to be a member of a known class, as a product of Class_Term weight and Class_Term density; where the Class_Term weight is the ratio of the number of documents of the class containing the term to the total number of documents containing the term and the Class_Term density is the relative density of occurrence of the term in the class to the total occurrence of the term in the entire population. Unlike the other existing term weighting schemes such as TF-IDF and its variants, the proposed relevance measure takes into account the degree of relative participation of the term across all documents of the class to the entire population. To demonstrate the significance of the proposed measure experimentation has been conducted on the 20 Newsgroups dataset. Further, the superiority of the novel measure is brought out through a comparative analysis.

在本文中，我们引入一个称为Term_Class相关性的新度量来计算将文档分类到特定类中的术语的相关性。所提出的测量方法估计给定术语的相关程度，将未标记文档作为已知类别的成员，作为Class_Term权重和Class_Term密度的乘积;其中Class_Term权重是包含该期限的类别的文件数量与包含该期限的文件总数的比率，并且Class_Term密度是该期间在该类别中出现的次数与该期限的总发生次数之间的相对密度在整个人口中。与TF-IDF及其变体等现有的其他加权方案不同，所提出的相关性度量考虑到该类别对全部人口的相对参与程度。为了证明所提出的措施的重要性，已经对20个新闻组数据集进行了实验。进一步通过比较分析，提出了新的措施的优越性。
