##### Abstract
The ambiguous annotation criteria bring into the divergence of Chinese Word Segmentation (CWS) datasets with various granularities. Multi-criteria learning leverage the annotation style of individual datasets and mine their common basic knowledge. In this paper, we proposed a domain adaptive segmenter to capture diverse criteria of datasets. Our model is based on Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT), which is responsible for introducing external knowledge. We also optimize its computational efficiency via model pruning, quantization, and compiler optimization. Experiments show that our segmenter outperforms the previous results on 10 CWS datasets and is faster than the previous state-of-the-art Bi-LSTM-CRF model.
