##### Abstract
This paper deals with the prediction of the memorability of a given image. We start by proposing an algorithm that reaches human-level performance on the LaMem dataset - the only large scale benchmark for memorability prediction. The suggested algorithm is based on three observations we make regarding convolutional neural networks (CNNs) that affect memorability prediction. Having reached human-level performance we were humbled, and asked ourselves whether indeed we have resolved memorability prediction - and answered this question in the negative. We studied a few factors and made some recommendations that should be taken into account when designing the next benchmark.
