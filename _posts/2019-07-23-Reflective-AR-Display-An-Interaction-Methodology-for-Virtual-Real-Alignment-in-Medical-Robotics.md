##### Abstract
Robot-assisted minimally invasive surgery has shown to improve patient outcomes, as well as reduce complications and recovery time for several clinical applications. However, increasingly configurable robotic arms require careful setup by surgical staff to maximize anatomical reach and avoid collisions. Furthermore, safety regulations prevent automatically driving robotic arms to this optimal positioning. We propose a Head-Mounted Display (HMD) based augmented reality (AR) guidance system for optimal surgical arm setup. In this case, the staff equipped with HMD aligns the robot with its planned virtual counterpart. The main challenge, however, is the perspective ambiguities hindering such collaborative robotic solution. To overcome this challenge, we introduce a novel registration concept for intuitive alignment of such AR content by providing a multi-view AR experience via reflective-AR displays that show the augmentations from multiple viewpoints. Using this system, operators can visualize different perspectives simultaneously while actively adjusting the pose to determine the registration transformation that most closely superimposes the virtual onto real. The experimental results demonstrate improvement in the interactive alignment of a virtual and real robot when using a reflective-AR display. We also present measurements from configuring a robotic manipulator in a simulated trocar placement surgery using the AR guidance methodology.
