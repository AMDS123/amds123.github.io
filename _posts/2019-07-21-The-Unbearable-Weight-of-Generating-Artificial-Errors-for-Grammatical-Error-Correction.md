##### Abstract
In recent years, sequence-to-sequence models have been very effective for end-to-end grammatical error correction (GEC). As creating human-annotated parallel corpus for GEC is expensive and time-consuming, there has been work on artificial corpus generation with the aim of creating sentences that contain realistic grammatical errors from grammatically correct sentences. In this paper, we investigate the impact of using recent neural models for generating errors to help neural models to correct errors. We conduct a battery of experiments on the effect of data size, models, and comparison with a rule-based approach.
