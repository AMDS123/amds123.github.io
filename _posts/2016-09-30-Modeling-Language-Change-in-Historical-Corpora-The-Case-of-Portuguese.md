##### Abstract
This paper presents a number of experiments to model changes in a historical Portuguese corpus composed of literary texts for the purpose of temporal text classification. Algorithms were trained to classify texts with respect to their publication date taking into account lexical variation represented as word n-grams, and morphosyntactic variation represented by part-of-speech (POS) distribution. We report results of 99.8% accuracy using word unigram features with a Support Vector Machines classifier to predict the publication date of documents in time intervals of both one century and half a century. A feature analysis is performed to investigate the most informative features for this task and how they are linked to language change.

##### Abstract (translated by Google)
本文提出了一系列实验来模拟由文本文本组成的历史葡萄牙语语料库中的时间文本分类变化。对算法进行训练，根据出版日期对文本进行分类，同时考虑用词n-gram表示的词汇变异和由词性（POS）分布表示的形态句法变化。我们使用支持向量机分类器的单字unigram特征来报告99.8％的准确性的结果，以预测在一个世纪和半个世纪的时间间隔内的文档的出版日期。执行功能分析以调查此任务的最丰富信息功能以及它们如何与语言更改相关联。
