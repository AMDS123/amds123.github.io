##### Abstract
Image classification is an ongoing research challenge. Most of the available research focuses on image classification for the English language, however there is very little research on image classification for the Arabic language. Expanding image classification to Arabic has several applications. The present study investigated a method for generating Arabic labels for images of objects. The method used in this study involved a direct English to Arabic translation of the labels that are currently available on ImageNet, a database commonly used in image classification research. The purpose of this study was to test the accuracy of this method. In this study, 2,887 labeled images were randomly selected from ImageNet. All of the labels were translated from English to Arabic using Google Translate. The accuracy of the translations was evaluated. Results indicated that that 65.6% of the Arabic labels were accurate. This study makes three important contributions to the image classification literature: (1) it determined the baseline level of accuracy for algorithms that provide Arabic labels for images, (2) it provided 1,895 images that are tagged with accurate Arabic labels, and (3) provided the accuracy of translations of image labels from English to Arabic.

图像分类是一项持续的研究挑战。大多数可用的研究都集中在英语语言的图像分类上，但对阿拉伯语的图像分类研究却很少。将图像分类扩展为阿拉伯语有几个应用程序。本研究调查了一种为物体图像生成阿拉伯标签的方法。本研究中使用的方法涉及ImageNet上目前可用的标签的直接英语到阿拉伯语的翻译，ImageNet是图像分类研究中常用的数据库。这项研究的目的是测试这种方法的准确性。在该研究中，从ImageNet中随机选择了2,887个标记图像。所有标签均使用Google翻译从英语翻译成阿拉伯语。评估了翻译的准确性。结果表明，65.6％的阿拉伯标签是准确的。这项研究对图像分类文献做出了三个重要贡献：（1）它确定了为图像提供阿拉伯标签的算法的基准准确度，（2）它提供了1,895个用准确的阿拉伯标签标记的图像，以及（3）提供了从英语到阿拉伯语的图像标签翻译的准确性。
