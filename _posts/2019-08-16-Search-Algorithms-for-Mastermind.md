##### Abstract
his paper presents two novel approaches to solving the classic board game mastermind, including a variant of simulated annealing (SA) and a technique we term maximum expected reduction in consistency (MERC). In addition, we compare search results for these algorithms to two baseline search methods: a random, uninformed search and the method of minimizing maximum query partition sets as originally developed by both Donald Knuth and Peter Norvig.
