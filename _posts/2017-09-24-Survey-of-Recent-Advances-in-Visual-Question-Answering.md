##### Abstract
Visual Question Answering (VQA) presents a unique challenge as it requires the ability to understand and encode the multi-modal inputs - in terms of image processing and natural language processing. The algorithm further needs to learn how to perform reasoning over this multi-modal representation so it can answer the questions correctly. This paper presents a survey of different approaches proposed to solve the problem of Visual Question Answering. We also describe the current state of the art model in later part of paper. In particular, the paper describes the approaches taken by various algorithms to extract image features, text features and the way these are employed to predict answers. We also briefly discuss the experiments performed to evaluate the VQA models and report their performances on diverse datasets including newly released VQA2.0[8].
