##### Abstract
Predicting TNM stage is the major determinant of breast cancer prognosis and treatment. The essential part of TNM stage classification is whether the cancer has metastasized to the regional lymph nodes (N-stage). Pathologic N-stage (pN-stage) is commonly performed by pathologists detecting metastasis in histological slides. However, this diagnostic procedure is prone to misinterpretation and would normally require extensive time by pathologists because of the sheer volume of data that needs a thorough review. Automated detection of lymph node metastasis and pN-stage prediction has a great potential to reduce their workload and help the pathologist. Recent advances in convolutional neural networks (CNN) have shown significant improvements in histological slide analysis, but accuracy is not optimized because of the difficulty in the handling of gigapixel images. In this paper, we propose a robust method for metastasis detection and pN-stage classification in breast cancer from multiple gigapixel pathology images in an effective way. pN-stage is predicted by combining patch-level CNN based metastasis detector and slide-level lymph node classifier. The proposed framework achieves a state-of-the-art quadratic weighted kappa score of 0.9203 on the Camelyon17 dataset, outperforming the previous winning method of the Camelyon17 challenge.

预测TNM分期是乳腺癌预后和治疗的主要决定因素。 TNM分期分类的关键部分是癌症是否已转移至区域淋巴结（N期）。病理性N期（pN期）通常由病理学家检测组织切片中的转移。但是，这种诊断程序很容易被误解，并且通常需要病理学家花费大量时间，因为需要彻底检查的数据量很大。自动检测淋巴结转移和pN期预测有很大的潜力来减少他们的工作量并帮助病理学家。卷积神经网络（CNN）的最新进展已显示组织学滑动分析的显着改进，但由于难以处理千兆像素图像，所以精确度未被优化。在本文中，我们提出了一种有效的方法，用于从多个千兆像素病理图像中有效地转移检测和乳腺癌pN阶段分类。通过结合贴片级CNN转移检测器和滑级淋巴结分类器预测pN期。所提出的框架在Camelyon17数据集上实现了最新的二次加权kappa评分0.9203，超过了Camelyon17挑战的先前获胜方法。
