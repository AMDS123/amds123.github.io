##### Abstract
We report on experimental realization of p-n heterojunctions based on p-type GaN, and an n-type correlated oxide, VO2. The band offsets are evaluated by current-voltage and capacitance voltage measurements at various temperatures. A band diagram based on the conventional band bending picture is proposed to explain the evolution of the apparent barier height from electrical measurements and it suggests that the work function of VO2 decreases by ~0.2 eV when it goes through the insulator to metal transtion, in qualitative agreement with Kelvin force microscopy measurements reported in literature. The frequency dependent capacitance measurements allows us to differentiate the miniority carrier effect from the interface states and series resistance contributions, and estimate the minority carrier lifetime in insulating phase of VO2 to be of the order of few microseconds. The nitride-oxide based p-n heterojunctions provide a new dimension

我们报告基于p型GaN的p-n异质结实验实现以及n型相关氧化物VO2。频带偏移通过在各种温度下的电流 - 电压和电容电压测量来评估。提出了一个基于传统能带弯曲图的能带图，来解释电学测量表观纬度的变化，表明当VO2的功函数通过绝缘体到金属转变时，其功函数降低〜0.2 eV，与文献报道的Kelvin力显微镜测量结果一致。频率相关的电容测量允许我们区分界面态和串联电阻贡献的最小载流子效应，并估计VO2绝缘阶段中的少数载流子寿命为几微秒。基于氮氧化物的p-n异质结提供了新的维度
