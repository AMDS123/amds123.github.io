##### Abstract
We propose a framework of genetic algorithms which use multi-level hierarchies to solve an optimization problem by searching over the space of simpler objective functions. We solve a variant of Travelling Salesman Problem called \texttt{soft-TSP} and show that when the constraints on the overall objective function are changed the algorithm adapts to churn out solutions for the changed objective. We use this idea to speed up learning by systematically altering the constraints to find a more globally optimal solution. We also use this framework to solve polynomial regression where the actual objective function is unknown but searching over space of available objective functions yields a good approximate solution.
