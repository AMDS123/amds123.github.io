##### Abstract
Neural segmentation has a great impact on the smooth implementation of local anesthesia surgery. At present, the network for the segmentation includes U-NET [1] and SegNet [2]. U-NET network has short training time and less training parameters, but the depth is not deep enough. SegNet network has deeper structure, but it needs longer training time, and more training samples. In this paper, we propose an improved U-NET neural network for the segmentation. This network deepens the original structure through importing residual network. Compared with U-NET and SegNet, the improved U-NET network has fewer training parameters, shorter training time and get a great improvement in segmentation effect. The improved U-NET network structure has a good application scene in neural segmentation.

神经分割对局部麻醉手术的顺利实施影响很大。目前，分割的网络包括U-NET [1]和SegNet [2]。 U-NET网络训练时间短，训练参数少，但深度不够深。 SegNet网络结构较为深入，但需要较长的训练时间和更多的训练样本。在本文中，我们提出了一个改进的U-NET神经网络的分割。该网络通过导入残留网络来加深原有结构。与U-NET和SegNet相比，改进的U-NET网络训练参数少，训练时间短，分割效果大大提高。改进后的U-NET网络结构在神经网络分割中具有良好的应用前景。
