##### Abstract
Retinal fundus photographs have been used in the diagnosis of many ocular diseases such as glaucoma, pathological myopia, age-related macular degeneration and diabetic retinopathy. With the development of computer science, computer aided diagnosis has been developed to process and analyse the retinal images automatically. One of the challenges in the analysis is that the quality of the retinal image is often degraded. For example, a cataract in human lens will attenuate the retinal image, just as a cloudy camera lens which reduces the quality of a photograph. It often obscures the details in the retinal images and posts challenges in retinal image processing and analysing tasks. In this paper, we approximate the degradation of the retinal images as a combination of human-lens attenuation and scattering. A novel structure-preserving guided retinal image filtering (SGRIF) is then proposed to restore images based on the attenuation and scattering model. The proposed SGRIF consists of a step of global structure transferring and a step of global edge-preserving smoothing. Our results show that the proposed SGRIF method is able to improve the contrast of retinal images, measured by histogram flatness measure, histogram spread and variability of local luminosity. In addition, we further explored the benefits of SGRIF for subsequent retinal image processing and analysing tasks. In the two applications of deep learning based optic cup segmentation and sparse learning based cup-to-disc ratio (CDR) computation, our results show that we are able to achieve more accurate optic cup segmentation and CDR measurements from images processed by SGRIF.

视网膜眼底照片已被用于诊断许多眼部疾病，例如青光眼，病理性近视，年龄相关性黄斑变性和糖尿病性视网膜病。随着计算机科学的发展，计算机辅助诊断技术已经发展到可以自动处理和分析视网膜图像。分析中的挑战之一是视网膜图像的质量经常降低。例如，人体晶状体中的白内障会使视网膜图像衰减，就像多云照相机镜头会降低照片的质量。它常常模糊了视网膜图像中的细节，并在视网膜图像处理和分析任务中发布挑战。在本文中，我们将视网膜图像的退化近似为人类晶状体衰减和散射的组合。然后基于衰减和散射模型提出了一种新的保存结构的导向视网膜图像滤波（SGRIF）来恢复图像。提出的SGRIF由全局结构转移步骤和全局边缘保持平滑步骤组成。我们的结果表明，所提出的SGRIF方法能够改善视网膜图像的对比度，通过直方图平直度测量，直方图传播和局部光度的可变性来测量。另外，我们进一步探索了SGRIF对后续视网膜图像处理和分析任务的益处。在基于深度学习的视杯分割和基于稀疏学习的杯盘比（CDR）计算的两种应用中，我们的结果显示我们能够通过SGRIF处理的图像实现更精确的视杯分割和CDR测量。
