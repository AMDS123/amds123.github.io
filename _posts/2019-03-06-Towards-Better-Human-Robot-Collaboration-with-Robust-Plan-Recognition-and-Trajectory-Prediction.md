##### Abstract
Human robot collaboration (HRC) is becoming increasingly important as the paradigm of manufacturing is shifting from mass production to mass customization. The introduction of HRC can significantly improve the flexibility and intelligence of automation. However, due to the stochastic and time-varying nature of human collaborators, it is challenging for the robot to efficiently and accurately identify the plan of human and respond in a safe manner. To address this challenge, we propose an integrated human robot collaboration framework in this paper which includes both plan recognition and trajectory prediction. Such a framework enables the robot to perceive, predict and adapt their actions to human's plan and intelligently avoid collision with human based on the predicted human trajectory. Moreover, by explicitly leveraging the hierarchical relationship between the plan and trajectories, more robust plan recognition performance can be achieved. Experiments are conducted on an industrial robot to verify the proposed framework.which shows that our proposed framework can not only assures safe HRC, but also improve the time efficiency of the HRC team, and the plan recognition module is not sensitive to noises.
