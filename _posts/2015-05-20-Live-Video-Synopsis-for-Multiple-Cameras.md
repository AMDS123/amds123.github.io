##### Abstract
Video surveillance cameras generate most of recorded video, and there is far more recorded video than operators can watch. Much progress has recently been made using summarization of recorded video, but such techniques do not have much impact on live video surveillance. We assume a camera hierarchy where a Master camera observes the decision-critical region, and one or more Slave cameras observe regions where past activity is important for making the current decision. We propose that when people appear in the live Master camera, the Slave cameras will display their past activities, and the operator could use past information for real-time decision making. The basic units of our method are action tubes, representing objects and their trajectories over time. Our object-based method has advantages over frame based methods, as it can handle multiple people, multiple activities for each person, and can address re-identification uncertainty.

视频监控摄像机产生大部分录制的视频，并且录制的视频比操作员可以观看的要多得多。近期录制视频的总结取得了很大的进展，但这种技术对现场视频监控的影响不大。我们假定一个摄像头层次结构，其中一个主摄像头观察决策关键区域，一个或多个从属摄像头观察过去活动对于做出当前决定的重要区域。我们建议，当人们出现在现场主摄像机中时，从摄像机将显示他们过去的活动，操作员可以使用过去的信息进行实时决策。我们的方法的基本单位是行动管，代表对象及其随着时间的轨迹。我们基于对象的方法相对于基于框架的方法具有优势，因为它可以处理多个人，针对每个人的多个活动，并且可以解决重新识别的不确定性。
