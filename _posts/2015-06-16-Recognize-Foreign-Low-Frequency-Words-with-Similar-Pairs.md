##### Abstract
Low-frequency words place a major challenge for automatic speech recognition (ASR). The probabilities of these words, which are often important name entities, are generally under-estimated by the language model (LM) due to their limited occurrences in the training data. Recently, we proposed a word-pair approach to deal with the problem, which borrows information of frequent words to enhance the probabilities of low-frequency words. This paper presents an extension to the word-pair method by involving multiple `predicting words' to produce better estimation for low-frequency words. We also employ this approach to deal with out-of-language words in the task of multi-lingual speech recognition.

低频词对于自动语音识别（ASR）是一个重大挑战。语言模型（LM）通常低估了这些通常是重要的名称实体的这些词的概率，这是因为它们在训练数据中的出现次数有限。最近，我们提出了一个词对处理这个问题的方法，它利用频繁词汇的信息来提高低频词汇的概率。本文通过涉及多个“预测词”对低频词产生更好的估计，给出了词对法的扩展。我们也采用这种方法来处理多语言语音识别任务中的外语单词。
