##### Abstract
This paper proposes Architectural Pattern Recommender (APR) system which helps in such architecture selection process. Main contribution of this work is in replacing the manual effort required to identify and analyse relevant architectural patterns in context of a particular set of software requirements. Key input to APR is a set of architecturally significant use cases concerning the application being developed. Central idea of APR's design is two folds: a) transform the unstructured information about software architecture design into a structured form which is suitable for recognizing textual entailment between a requirement scenario and a potential architectural pattern. b) leverage the rich experiential knowledge embedded in discussions on professional developer support forums such as Stackoverflow to check the sentiment about a design decision. APR makes use of both the above elements to identify a suitable architectural pattern and assess its suitability for a given set of requirements. Efficacy of APR has been evaluated by comparing its recommendations for "ground truth" scenarios (comprising of applications whose architecture is well known).

本文提出了建筑模式推荐（APR）系统，它有助于这种架构选择过程。这项工作的主要贡献在于替换在特定软件需求集的上下文中识别和分析相关架构模式所需的手动工作。 APR的关键输入是一组涉及正在开发的应用程序的架构上重要的用例。 APR设计的核心思想有两个方面：a）将关于软件架构设计的非结构化信息转换为结构化形式，适合于识别需求场景和潜在架构模式之间的文本蕴涵。 b）利用Stackoverflow等专业开发人员支持论坛中讨论中丰富的经验知识来检查有关设计决策的情绪。 APR利用上述两个元素来确定合适的架构模式，并评估其对一组给定要求的适用性。通过比较其对“地面实况”情景（包括其结构众所周知的应用程序）的建议，评估了APR的功效。
