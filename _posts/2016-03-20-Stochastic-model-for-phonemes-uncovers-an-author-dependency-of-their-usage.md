##### Abstract
We study rank-frequency relations for phonemes, the minimal units that still relate to linguistic meaning. We show that these relations can be described by the Dirichlet distribution, a direct analogue of the ideal-gas model in statistical mechanics. This description allows us to demonstrate that the rank-frequency relations for phonemes of a text do depend on its author. The author-dependency effect is not caused by the author's vocabulary (common words used in different texts), and is confirmed by several alternative means. This suggests that it can be directly related to phonemes. These features contrast to rank-frequency relations for words, which are both author and text independent and are governed by the Zipf's law.

##### Abstract (translated by Google)
我们研究音素的等级频率关系，即与语言意义相关的最小单位。我们证明这些关系可以用Dirichlet分布来描述，这是统计力学中理想气体模型的一个直接类比。这个描述使我们能够证明文本音素的等级频率关系取决于其作者。作者依赖效应不是由作者的词汇（不同文本中使用的常用词）引起的，而是由多种替代手段所确认的。这表明它可以直接与音素相关。这些特征与单词的等级 - 频率关系形成对比，这些关系既是作者也是文本独立的，并受Zipf定律的支配。
