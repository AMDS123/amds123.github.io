##### Abstract
Facial recognition has always been a challeng- ing task for computer vision scientists and experts. Despite complexities arising due to variations in camera parameters, illumination and face orientations, significant progress has been made in the field with deep learning algorithms now competing with human-level accuracy. But in contrast to the recent advances in face recognition techniques, Disguised Facial Identification continues to be a tougher challenge in the field of computer vision. The modern day scenario, where security is of prime concern, regular face identification techniques do not perform as required when the faces are disguised, which calls for a different approach to handle situations where intruders have their faces masked. Along the same lines, we propose a deep learning architecture for disguised facial recognition (DFR). The algorithm put forward in this paper detects 20 facial key-points in the first stage, using a 14-layered convolutional neural network (CNN). These facial key-points are later utilized by a support vector machine (SVM) for classifying the disguised faces based on the euclidean distance ratios and angles between different facial key-points. This overall architecture imparts a basic intelligence to our system. Our key-point feature prediction accuracy is 65% while the classification rate is 72.4%. Moreover, the architecture works at 19 FPS, thereby performing in almost real-time. The efficiency of our approach is also compared with the state-of-the-art Disguised Facial Identification methods.

面部识别一直是计算机视觉科学家和专家的一项挑战性任务。尽管由于相机参数，照明和面部方向的变化而产生复杂性，但是在该领域中已经取得了显着的进步，其中深度学习算法现在与人类级精度竞争。但与人脸识别技术的最新进展相反，伪装面部识别仍然是计算机视觉领域的一个更严峻的挑战。在现代情景中，安全性是首要关注的问题，当面部伪装时，常规的面部识别技术不能按要求执行，这需要采用不同的方法来处理入侵者掩盖其面部的情况。同样，我们提出了一种伪装面部识别（DFR）的深度学习架构。本文提出的算法使用14层卷积神经网络（CNN）检测第一阶段的20个面部关键点。这些面部关键点稍后由支持向量机（SVM）利用，用于基于欧几里德距离比和不同面部关键点之间的角度对伪装面进行分类。这种整体架构为我们的系统提供了基本的智能。我们的关键点特征预测准确率为65％，而分类率为72.4％。此外，该架构工作在19 FPS，因此几乎可以实时执行。我们的方法的效率也与最先进的伪装面部识别方法进行了比较。
