##### Abstract
Hand-crafted features based on linguistic and domain-knowledge play crucial role in determining the performance of disease name recognition systems. Such methods are further limited by the scope of these features or in other words, their ability to cover the contexts or word dependencies within a sentence. In this work, we focus on reducing such dependencies and propose a domain-invariant framework for the disease name recognition task. In particular, we propose various end-to-end recurrent neural network (RNN) models for the tasks of disease name recognition and their classification into four pre-defined categories. We also utilize convolution neural network (CNN) in cascade of RNN to get character-based embedded features and employ it with word-embedded features in our model. We compare our models with the state-of-the-art results for the two tasks on NCBI disease dataset. Our results for the disease mention recognition task indicate that state-of-the-art performance can be obtained without relying on feature engineering. Further the proposed models obtained improved performance on the classification task of disease names.

基于语言和领域知识的手工特征在确定疾病名称识别系统的性能方面起着至关重要的作用。这些方法进一步受限于这些特征的范围，或者换句话说，它们覆盖句子内的上下文或单词依赖性的能力。在这项工作中，我们专注于减少这种依赖关系，并提出一个领域不变框架疾病名称识别任务。具体而言，我们提出了用于疾病名称识别任务的各种端到端递归神经网络（RNN）模型，并将其分类为四个预先定义的类别。我们还利用RNN级联中的卷积神经网络（CNN）来获得基于字符的嵌入式特征，并在模型中使用带有字嵌入特征的特征。我们将我们的模型与NCBI疾病数据集的两项任务的最新成果进行比较。我们的疾病提及识别任务的结果表明，可以在不依赖特征工程的情况下获得最先进的性能。此外，所提出的模型在疾病名称分类任务上获得了改进的性能。
