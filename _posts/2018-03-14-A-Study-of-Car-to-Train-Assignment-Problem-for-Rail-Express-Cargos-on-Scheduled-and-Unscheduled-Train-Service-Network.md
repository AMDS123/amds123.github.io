##### Abstract
Freight train services in a railway network system are generally divided into two categories: one is the unscheduled train, whose operating frequency fluctuates with origin-destination (OD) demands; the other is the scheduled train, which is running based on regular timetable just like the passenger trains. The timetable will be released to the public if determined and it would not be influenced by OD demands. Typically, the total capacity of scheduled trains can usually satisfy the predicted demands of express cargos in average. However, the demands are changing in practice. Therefore, how to distribute the shipments between different stations to unscheduled and scheduled train services has become an important research field in railway transportation. This paper focuses on the coordinated optimization of the rail express cargos distribution in two service networks. On the premise of fully utilizing the capacity of scheduled service network first, we established a Car-to-Train (CTT) assignment model to assign rail express cargos to scheduled and unscheduled trains scientifically. The objective function is to maximize the net income of transporting the rail express cargos. The constraints include the capacity restriction on the service arcs, flow balance constraints, logical relationship constraint between two groups of decision variables and the due date constraint. The last constraint is to ensure that the total transportation time of a shipment would not be longer than its predefined due date. Finally, we discuss the linearization techniques to simplify the model proposed in this paper, which make it possible for obtaining global optimal solution by using the commercial software.

铁路网络系统中的货运列车服务一般分为两类：一类是未计划列车，其运行频率随起点 - 目的地（OD）需求而波动;另一种是定期列车，按照客运列车的常规时间表运行。如果确定，时间表将公布给公众，并且不会受到OD要求的影响。通常情况下，预定列车的总容量通常能够平均满足快递货物的预计需求。但是，实践中需求正在发生变化。因此，如何将不同车站间的货物分配到不定期和定期的列车服务，已成为铁路运输的重要研究领域。本文重点讨论了两个服务网络中铁路快递货物配送的协调优化问题。在充分利用定期服务网络能力的前提下，我们建立了车到车（CTT）分配模型，将铁路快递货物科学地分配到定时和不定期的列车上。目标函数是最大化运输铁路快递货物的净收入。约束条件包括服务弧上的容量限制，流量平衡约束，两组决策变量之间的逻辑关系约束以及到期日约束。最后一个约束是确保货物的总运输时间不会超过预定的到期日。最后，我们讨论线性化技术以简化本文提出的模型，这使得使用商业软件获得全局最优解成为可能。
