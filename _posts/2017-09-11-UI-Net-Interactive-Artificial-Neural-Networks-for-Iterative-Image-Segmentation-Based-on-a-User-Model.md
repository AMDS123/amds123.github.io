##### Abstract
For complex segmentation tasks, fully automatic systems are inherently limited in their achievable accuracy for extracting relevant objects. Especially in cases where only few data sets need to be processed for a highly accurate result, semi-automatic segmentation techniques exhibit a clear benefit for the user. One area of application is medical image processing during an intervention for a single patient. We propose a learning-based cooperative segmentation approach which includes the computing entity as well as the user into the task. Our system builds upon a state-of-the-art fully convolutional artificial neural network (FCN) as well as an active user model for training. During the segmentation process, a user of the trained system can iteratively add additional hints in form of pictorial scribbles as seed points into the FCN system to achieve an interactive and precise segmentation result. The segmentation quality of interactive FCNs is evaluated. Iterative FCN approaches can yield superior results compared to networks without the user input channel component, due to a consistent improvement in segmentation quality after each interaction.

对于复杂的分割任务，全自动系统本身就限制了其提取相关对象的可实现精度。特别是在仅需要处理少量数据集以获得高度准确的结果的情况下，半自动分割技术对用户显示出明显的益处。一个应用领域是在针对单个患者进行干预期间的医学图像处理。我们提出了一个基于学习的协作分割方法，其中包括计算实体以及用户进入任务。我们的系统建立在最先进的全卷积人工神经网络（FCN）以及用于训练的活动用户模型之上。在分割过程中，被训练系统的用户可以将图形涂鸦形式的附加提示作为种子点迭代添加到FCN系统中，实现交互性和精确的分割结果。评估交互式FCN的分割质量。由于每次交互之后分段质量的一致改进，与没有用户输入信道分量的网络相比，迭代FCN方法可以产生更好的结果。
