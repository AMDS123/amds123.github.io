##### Abstract
Hyperspectral imaging provides detailed information about the scanned objects, as it captures their spectral characteristics within a large number of wavelength bands. Classification of such data has become an active research topic due to its wide applicability in a variety of fields. Deep learning has established the state of the art in the area, and it constitutes the current research mainstream. In this letter, we introduce a new spectral-spatial convolutional neural network, benefitting from a battery of data augmentation techniques which help deal with a real-life problem of lacking ground-truth training data. Our rigorous experiments showed that the proposed method outperforms other spectral-spatial techniques from the literature, and delivers precise hyperspectral classification in real time.
