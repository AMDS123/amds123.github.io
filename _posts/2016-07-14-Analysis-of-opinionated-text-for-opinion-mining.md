##### Abstract
In sentiment analysis, the polarities of the opinions expressed on an object/feature are determined to assess the sentiment of a sentence or document whether it is positive/negative/neutral. Naturally, the object/feature is a noun representation which refers to a product or a component of a product, let us say, the "lens" in a camera and opinions emanating on it are captured in adjectives, verbs, adverbs and noun words themselves. Apart from such words, other meta-information and diverse effective features are also going to play an important role in influencing the sentiment polarity and contribute significantly to the performance of the system. In this paper, some of the associated information/meta-data are explored and investigated in the sentiment text. Based on the analysis results presented here, there is scope for further assessment and utilization of the meta-information as features in text categorization, ranking text document, identification of spam documents and polarity classification problems.

在情感分析中，对某个客体/特征所表达的意见的极性决定了对一个句子或文件的情感进行评估，以判断其是正面/负面/中性。自然地，对象/特征是指产品或产品组件的名词表示，让我们说，照相机中的“镜头”和发出的意见被形容词，动词，副词和名词词组自己捕捉。除此之外，其他元信息和多样化的有效特征也将在影响情感极性方面发挥重要作用，并对系统的性能起重要作用。在本文中，一些相关的信息/元数据在情感文本中被探索和调查。根据这里给出的分析结果，可以进一步评估和利用元信息作为文本分类，排序文本文件，垃圾文档识别和极性分类问题的特征。
