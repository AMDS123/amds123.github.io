##### Abstract
In this paper, we tackle the problem of RGB-D semantic segmentation of indoor images. We take advantage of deconvolutional networks which can predict pixel-wise class labels, and develop a new structure for deconvolution of multiple modalities. We propose a novel feature transformation network to bridge the convolutional networks and deconvolutional networks. In the feature transformation network, we correlate the two modalities by discovering common features between them, as well as characterize each modality by discovering modality specific features. With the common features, we not only closely correlate the two modalities, but also allow them to borrow features from each other to enhance the representation of shared information. With specific features, we capture the visual patterns that are only visible in one modality. The proposed network achieves competitive segmentation accuracy on NYU depth dataset V1 and V2.

本文针对室内图像的RGB-D语义分割问题，我们利用可以预测像素级标签的去卷积网络，并开发出一种新的多模式反卷积结构。我们提出了一种新的特征变换网络来桥接卷积网络和反卷积网络。在特征转换网络中，我们通过发现它们之间的共同特征来关联这两种模式，并且通过发现特定模式特征来表征每种模式。有了这些共同的特点，我们不仅将两种模式紧密联系在一起，而且还可以互相借用特征来提高共享信息的表达。具有特定的功能，我们捕捉只在一种模式中可见的视觉模式。所提出的网络在NYU深度数据集V1和V2上实现了有竞争力的分割准确性。
