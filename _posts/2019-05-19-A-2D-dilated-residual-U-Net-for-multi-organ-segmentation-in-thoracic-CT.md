##### Abstract
Automatic segmentation of organs-at-risk (OAR) in computed tomography (CT) is an essential part of planning effective treatment strategies to combat lung and esophageal cancer. Accurate segmentation of organs surrounding tumours helps account for the variation in position and morphology inherent across patients, thereby facilitating adaptive and computer-assisted radiotherapy. Although manual delineation of OARs is still highly prevalent, it is prone to errors due to complex variations in the shape and position of organs across patients, and low soft tissue contrast between neighbouring organs in CT images. Recently, deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have gained tremendous traction and achieved state-of-the-art results in medical image segmentation. In this paper, we propose a deep learning framework to segment OARs in thoracic CT images, specifically for the: heart, esophagus, trachea and aorta. Our approach employs dilated convolutions and aggregated residual connections in the bottleneck of a U-Net styled network, which incorporates global context and dense information. Our method achieved an overall Dice score of 91.57% on 20 unseen test samples from the ISBI 2019 SegTHOR challenge.
