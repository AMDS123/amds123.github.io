##### Abstract
Thanks to the growing availability of spoofing databases and rapid advances in using them, systems for detecting voice spoofing attacks are becoming more and more capable, and error rates close to zero are being reached for the ASVspoof2015 database. However, speech synthesis and voice conversion paradigms that are not considered in the ASVspoof2015 database are appearing. Such examples include direct waveform modelling and generative adversarial networks. We also need to investigate the feasibility of training spoofing systems using only low-quality found data. For that purpose, we developed a generative adversarial network-based speech enhancement system that improves the quality of speech data found in publicly available sources. Using the enhanced data, we trained state-of-the-art text-to-speech and voice conversion models and evaluated them in terms of perceptual speech quality and speaker similarity. The results show that the enhancement models significantly improved the SNR of low-quality degraded data found in publicly available sources and that they significantly improved the perceptual cleanliness of the source speech without significantly degrading the naturalness of the voice. However, the results also show limitations when generating speech with the low-quality found data.

由于欺骗数据库的可用性不断提高以及使用这些数据库的快速进展，用于检测语音欺骗攻击的系统的能力越来越强大，ASVspoof2015数据库的错误率也接近于零。但是，ASVspoof2015数据库中未考虑的语音合成和语音转换范例正在出现。这样的例子包括直接波形建模和生成对抗网络。我们还需要调查只使用低质量数据的训练欺骗系统的可行性。为此，我们开发了一种基于网络的生成对抗语音增强系统，可以提高公开可用来源中的语音数据质量。使用增强型数据，我们训练了最先进的文本到语音和语音转换模型，并根据感知语音质量和说话人相似性对其进行评估。结果表明，增强模型显着改善了公共可用来源中发现的低质量降级数据的信噪比，并且它们显着改善了源语音的感知清洁度，而不显着降低语音的自然度。然而，当使用低质量的发现数据产生​​语音时，结果也显示出局限性。
