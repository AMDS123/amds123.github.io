##### Abstract
Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) are able to learn excellent representations for unlabelled data which can be applied to image generation and scene classification. Representations learned by GANs have not yet been applied to retrieval. In this paper, we show that the representations learned by GANs can indeed be used for retrieval. We consider heritage documents that contain unlabelled Merchant Marks, sketch-like symbols that are similar to hieroglyphs. We introduce a novel GAN architecture with design features that make it suitable for sketch retrieval. The performance of this sketch-GAN is compared to a modified version of the original GAN architecture with respect to simple invariance properties. Experiments suggest that sketch-GANs learn representations that are suitable for retrieval and which also have increased stability to rotation, scale and translation compared to the standard GAN architecture.

生成对抗网络（GAN）能够学习可用于图像生成和场景分类的未标记数据的优秀表示。 GAN学到的表示法尚未应用于检索。在本文中，我们表明，GAN学到的表示确实可以用于检索。我们考虑遗产文件，其中包含未标记的商标，类似于象形文字的草图符号。我们引入了一种新颖的GAN架构，其设计特点使其适合草图检索。 GAN的性能与原始GAN体系结构的简单不变特性的修改版本进行了比较。实验表明，sketch-GANs学习表示适合于检索，并且与标准GAN结构相比，也具有增加的旋转，缩放和平移的稳定性。
