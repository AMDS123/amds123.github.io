##### Abstract
Quantum information technologies, and intelligent learning systems, are both emergent technologies that will likely have a transforming impact on our society. The respective underlying fields of research -- quantum information (QI) versus machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) -- have their own specific challenges, which have hitherto been investigated largely independently. However, in a growing body of recent work, researchers have been probing the question to what extent these fields can learn and benefit from each other. QML explores the interaction between quantum computing and ML, investigating how results and techniques from one field can be used to solve the problems of the other. Recently, we have witnessed breakthroughs in both directions of influence. For instance, quantum computing is finding a vital application in providing speed-ups in ML, critical in our "big data" world. Conversely, ML already permeates cutting-edge technologies, and may become instrumental in advanced quantum technologies. Aside from quantum speed-up in data analysis, or classical ML optimization used in quantum experiments, quantum enhancements have also been demonstrated for interactive learning, highlighting the potential of quantum-enhanced learning agents. Finally, works exploring the use of AI for the very design of quantum experiments, and for performing parts of genuine research autonomously, have reported their first successes. Beyond the topics of mutual enhancement, researchers have also broached the fundamental issue of quantum generalizations of ML/AI concepts. This deals with questions of the very meaning of learning and intelligence in a world that is described by quantum mechanics. In this review, we describe the main ideas, recent developments, and progress in a broad spectrum of research investigating machine learning and artificial intelligence in the quantum domain.

量子信息技术和智能学习系统都是新兴技术，可能会对我们的社会产生转变的影响。各自的研究领域 - 量子信息（QI）与机器学习（ML）和人工智能（AI） - 都有其独特的挑战，迄今为止这些挑战在很大程度上是独立进行的。然而，在近期的研究中，研究人员一直在探索这些领域在多大程度上可以相互学习和获益的问题。 QML探索了量子计算和ML之间的相互作用，研究了一个领域的结果和技术如何被用来解决另一个领域的问题。最近，我们看到了两个影响力方面的突破。例如，量子计算正在为ML提供加速，在我们的“大数据”世界中至关重要。相反，ML已经渗透了尖端的技术，并可能成为先进的量子技术的工具。除了数据分析中的量子加速或量子实验中使用的经典ML最优化之外，量子增强也被用于交互学习，突出了量子增强学习代理的潜力。最后，探索使用人工智能进行量子实验的设计，并自主地进行真正的研究部分，已经报告了他们的第一个成功。除了相互促进的话题之外，研究人员还提出了ML / AI概念的量子概括的基本问题。这涉及量子力学所描述的世界中学习和智力的意义问题。在这篇综述中，我们描述了在量子领域中研究机器学习和人工智能的广泛研究的主要思想，最新进展和进展。
