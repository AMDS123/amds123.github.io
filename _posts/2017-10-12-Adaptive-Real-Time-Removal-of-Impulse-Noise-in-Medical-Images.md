##### Abstract
Noise is an important factor that degrades the quality of medical images. Impulse noise is a common noise, which is caused by malfunctioning of sensor elements or errors in the transmission of images. In medical images due to presence of white foreground and black background, many pixels have intensities similar to impulse noise and distinction between noisy and regular pixels is difficult. In software techniques, the accuracy of the noise removal is more important than the algorithm's complexity. But for hardware implementation having a low complexity algorithm with an acceptable accuracy is essential. In this paper a low complexity de-noising method is proposed that removes the noise by local analysis of the image blocks. The proposed method distinguishes non-noisy pixels that have noise-like intensities. All steps are designed to have low hardware complexity. Simulation results show that for different magnetic resonance images, the proposed method removes impulse noise with an acceptable accuracy.

噪声是影响医学图像质量的重要因素。脉冲噪声是常见的噪声，这是由传感器元件的故障或图像传输中的错误引起的。在医学图像中，由于存在白色前景和黑色背景，许多像素具有类似于脉冲噪声的强度，并且难以区分噪声和规则像素。在软件技术中，噪声去除的准确性比算法的复杂性更重要。但是对于具有可接受的精度的低复杂度算法的硬件实现是必不可少的。本文提出了一种低复杂度的去噪方法，通过局部分析图像块来消除噪声。所提出的方法区分具有噪声强度的非噪声像素。所有步骤都设计为具有较低的硬件复杂性。仿真结果表明，对于不同的磁共振图像，所提出的方法去除了可接受的精度的脉冲噪声。
