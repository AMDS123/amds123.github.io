##### Abstract
Emoticons (e.g., :) and :( ) have been widely used in sentiment analysis and other NLP tasks as features to ma- chine learning algorithms or as entries of sentiment lexicons. In this paper, we argue that while emoticons are strong and common signals of sentiment expression on social media the relationship between emoticons and sentiment polarity are not always clear. Thus, any algorithm that deals with sentiment polarity should take emoticons into account but extreme cau- tion should be exercised in which emoticons to depend on. First, to demonstrate the prevalence of emoticons on social media, we analyzed the frequency of emoticons in a large re- cent Twitter data set. Then we carried out four analyses to examine the relationship between emoticons and sentiment polarity as well as the contexts in which emoticons are used. The first analysis surveyed a group of participants for their perceived sentiment polarity of the most frequent emoticons. The second analysis examined clustering of words and emoti- cons to better understand the meaning conveyed by the emoti- cons. The third analysis compared the sentiment polarity of microblog posts before and after emoticons were removed from the text. The last analysis tested the hypothesis that removing emoticons from text hurts sentiment classification by training two machine learning models with and without emoticons in the text respectively. The results confirms the arguments that: 1) a few emoticons are strong and reliable signals of sentiment polarity and one should take advantage of them in any senti- ment analysis; 2) a large group of the emoticons conveys com- plicated sentiment hence they should be treated with extreme caution.

表情符号（例如:)和:(）已被广泛用于情感分析和其他NLP任务，作为机器学习算法的特征或作为情感词典的条目。在本文中，我们认为，虽然表情符号是强烈的，在社交媒体上表达情感的共同信号，表情符号和情感极性之间的关系并不总是清晰的。因此，任何处理情感极性的算法都应该考虑表情符号，但是应该非常小心地使用表情符号。首先，为了展示社交媒体上表情符号的流行，我们分析了大量最新的Twitter数据集中的表情符号的频率。然后，我们进行了四个分析，以检查表情符号和情绪极性之间的关系以及表情符号的使用环境。第一个分析调查了一组参与者感受到最频繁的表情的情绪极性。第二个分析考察了词汇和情感的集聚，以更好地理解情感所表达的意义。第三个分析比较了表情符号从文本中删除前后的微博帖子的情感极性。最后的分析测试了这样一个假设，即从文本中删除表情符号，通过分别训练两个带有和不带有表情符号的机器学习模型来伤害情感分类。结果证实了以下论点：1）少数表情符号是情感极性强而可靠的信号，任何情感分析都应该利用这些信息; 2）一大批表情传达着复杂的情绪，所以应该小心谨慎。
