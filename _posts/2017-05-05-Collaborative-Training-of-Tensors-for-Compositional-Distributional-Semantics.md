##### Abstract
Type-based compositional distributional semantic models present an interesting line of research into functional representations of linguistic meaning. One of the drawbacks of such models, however, is the lack of training data required to train each word-type combination. In this paper we address this by introducing training methods that share parameters between similar words. We show that these methods enable zero-shot learning for words that have no training data at all, as well as enabling construction of high-quality tensors from very few training examples per word.

基于类型的成分分布语义模型提出了一个有趣的语言意义功能表征研究线。然而，这种模型的缺点之一是缺乏培训每个单词组合所需的训练数据。在本文中，我们通过引入在相似词之间共享参数的训练方法来解决这个问题。我们表明，这些方法可以对没有任何训练数据的单词进行零点学习，也可以从每个单词的极少数训练样例中构建高质量的张量。
