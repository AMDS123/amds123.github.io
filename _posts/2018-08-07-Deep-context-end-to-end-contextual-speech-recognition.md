##### Abstract
In automatic speech recognition (ASR) what a user says depends on the particular context she is in. Typically, this context is represented as a set of word n-grams. In this work, we present a novel, all-neural, end-to-end (E2E) ASR sys- tem that utilizes such context. Our approach, which we re- fer to as Contextual Listen, Attend and Spell (CLAS) jointly- optimizes the ASR components along with embeddings of the context n-grams. During inference, the CLAS system can be presented with context phrases which might contain out-of- vocabulary (OOV) terms not seen during training. We com- pare our proposed system to a more traditional contextualiza- tion approach, which performs shallow-fusion between inde- pendently trained LAS and contextual n-gram models during beam search. Across a number of tasks, we find that the pro- posed CLAS system outperforms the baseline method by as much as 68% relative WER, indicating the advantage of joint optimization over individually trained components. Index Terms: speech recognition, sequence-to-sequence models, listen attend and spell, LAS, attention, embedded speech recognition.

在自动语音识别（ASR）中，用户所说的取决于她所处的特定上下文。通常，该上下文表示为一组单词n-gram。在这项工作中，我们提出了一个利用这种背景的新颖的，全神经的端到端（E2E）ASR系统。我们的方法，我们称之为Contextual Listen，Attend and Spell（CLAS）联合优化ASR组件以及上下文n-gram的嵌入。在推理期间，可以向CLAS系统呈现上下文短语，其可以包含在训练期间未见的词外（OOV）术语。我们将我们提出的系统与更传统的情境化方法进行比较，该方法在光束搜索期间在独立训练的LAS和上下文n-gram模型之间执行浅层融合。在许多任务中，我们发现建议的CLAS系统优于基线方法的相对WER高达68％，表明联合优化优于单独训练的组件。索引术语：语音识别，序列到序列模型，听力参与和拼写，LAS，注意力，嵌入式语音识别。
