##### Abstract
Pooling is an important component in convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for aggregating features and reducing computational burden. Compared with other components such as convolutional layers and fully connected layers which are completely learned from data, the pooling component is still handcrafted such as max pooling and average pooling. This paper proposes a learnable pooling function using recurrent neural networks (RNN) so that the pooling can be fully adapted to data and other components of the network, leading to an improved performance. Such a network with learnable pooling function is referred to as a fully trainable network (FTN). Experimental results have demonstrated that the proposed RNN-based pooling can well approximate the existing pooling functions and improve the performance of the network. Especially for small networks, the proposed FTN can improve the performance by seven percentage points in terms of error rate on the CIFAR-10 dataset compared with the traditional CNN.

集合是卷积神经网络（CNN）中的重要组成部分，用于聚合特征并减少计算负担。与完全从数据中学习的卷积层和完全连接层等其他组件相比，池化组件仍然是手工制作的，如最大池和平均池。本文提出了一种使用递归神经网络（RNN）的可学习池功能，以使池可以完全适应网络中的数据和其他组件，从而提高性能。这种具有可学习池功能的网络被称为完全可训练网络（FTN）。实验结果表明，提出的基于RNN的池可以很好地逼近现有的池功能，提高网络的性能。特别是对于小型网络，与传统CNN相比，所提出的FTN在CIFAR-10数据集上的性能提高了7个百分点。
