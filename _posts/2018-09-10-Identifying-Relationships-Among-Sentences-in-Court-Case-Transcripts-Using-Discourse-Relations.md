##### Abstract
Case Law has a significant impact on the proceedings of legal cases. Therefore, the information that can be obtained from previous court cases is valuable to lawyers and other legal officials when performing their duties. This paper describes a methodology of applying discourse relations between sentences when processing text documents related to the legal domain. In this study, we developed a mechanism to classify the relationships that can be observed among sentences in transcripts of United States court cases. First, we defined relationship types that can be observed between sentences in court case transcripts. Then we classified pairs of sentences according to the relationship type by combining a machine learning model and a rule-based approach. The results obtained through our system were evaluated using human judges. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study where discourse relationships between sentences have been used to determine relationships among sentences in legal court case transcripts.

判例法对法律案件的诉讼程序产生重大影响。因此，从以前的法院案件中获得的信息对律师和其他法律官员履行职责很有价值。本文描述了在处理与法律领域相关的文本文档时应用句子之间的话语关系的方法。在这项研究中，我们开发了一种机制，可以对美国法院案件的抄本中的句子之间可以观察到的关系进行分类。首先，我们定义了可以在法庭案件记录中的句子之间观察到的关系类型。然后，我们通过结合机器学习模型和基于规则的方法，根据关系类型对句子对进行分类。通过我们的系统获得的结果使用人类评判进行评估。据我们所知，这是第一项研究，其中句子之间的话语关系被用来确定法律案件案件抄本中句子之间的关系。
