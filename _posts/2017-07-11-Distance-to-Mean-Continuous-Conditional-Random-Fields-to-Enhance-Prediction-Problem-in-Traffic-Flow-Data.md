##### Abstract
The increase of vehicle in highways may cause traffic congestion as well as in the normal roadways. Predicting the traffic flow in highways especially, is demanded to solve this congestion problem. Predictions on time-series multivariate data, such as in the traffic flow dataset, have been largely accomplished through various approaches. The approach with conventional prediction algorithms, such as with Support Vector Machine (SVM), is only capable of accommodating predictions that are independent in each time unit. Hence, the sequential relationships in this time series data is hardly explored. Continuous Conditional Random Field (CCRF) is one of Probabilistic Graphical Model (PGM) algorithms which can accommodate this problem. The neighboring aspects of sequential data such as in the time series data can be expressed by CCRF so that its predictions are more reliable. In this article, a novel approach called DM-CCRF is adopted by modifying the CCRF prediction algorithm to strengthen the probability of the predictions made by the baseline regressor. The result shows that DM-CCRF is superior in performance compared to CCRF. This is validated by the error decrease of the baseline up to 9% significance. This is twice the standard CCRF performance which can only decrease baseline error by 4.582% at most.

高速公路上的车辆增加可能造成交通堵塞，也可能造成正常的道路。特别是要预测高速公路的交通流量，就要解决这个拥堵问题。时间序列多变量数据的预测，例如交通流量数据集，已经通过各种方法在很大程度上完成。传统预测算法（如支持向量机（SVM））的方法只能适应每个时间单元独立的预测。因此，这个时间序列数据中的顺序关系很难被探索。连续条件随机场（CCRF）是可以容纳这个问题的概率图形模型（PGM）算法之一。诸如时间序列数据的顺序数据的相邻方面可以由CCRF表示，使得其预测更可靠。在本文中，通过修改CCRF预测算法来增强基线回归器预测的概率，采用一种称为DM-CCRF的新方法。结果表明DM-CCRF在性能上优于CCRF。这通过基线的误差减少达到9％的显着性来验证。这是标准CCRF性能的两倍，最多只能将基线误差减少4.582％。
