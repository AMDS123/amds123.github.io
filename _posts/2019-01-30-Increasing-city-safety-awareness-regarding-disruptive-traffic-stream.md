##### Abstract
Transportation systems serve the people in essence, in this study we focus in traffic information related to violation events to respond to safety requirements of the cities. Traffic violation events have an important role in city safety awareness and secure travel. In this work, we describe the use of knowledge discovery from traffic violation reports in combination with demographics approach using inductive logic programming to automatically extract knowledge about traffic violation behavior and their impact on the environment.
