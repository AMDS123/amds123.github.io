##### Abstract
Recent progress in artificial intelligence (AI) has renewed interest in building systems that learn and think like people. Many advances have come from using deep neural networks trained end-to-end in tasks such as object recognition, video games, and board games, achieving performance that equals or even beats humans in some respects. Despite their biological inspiration and performance achievements, these systems differ from human intelligence in crucial ways. We review progress in cognitive science suggesting that truly human-like learning and thinking machines will have to reach beyond current engineering trends in both what they learn, and how they learn it. Specifically, we argue that these machines should (a) build causal models of the world that support explanation and understanding, rather than merely solving pattern recognition problems; (b) ground learning in intuitive theories of physics and psychology, to support and enrich the knowledge that is learned; and (c) harness compositionality and learning-to-learn to rapidly acquire and generalize knowledge to new tasks and situations. We suggest concrete challenges and promising routes towards these goals that can combine the strengths of recent neural network advances with more structured cognitive models.

人工智能（AI）方面的最新进展重新构建了像人一样学习和思考的系统。在诸如对象识别，视频游戏和棋盘游戏等任务中使用深入训练的深度神经网络取得了许多进步，实现了在某些方面等于或甚至击败人类的表现。尽管他们具有生物学上的灵感和成就，但这些系统在关键方面与人类的智能不同。我们回顾了认知科学的进展，认为真正类似人类的学习和思维机器必须超越当前的工程学趋势，无论学到什么，学到什么。具体而言，我们认为这些机器应该（a）建立支持解释和理解的世界因果模型，而不仅仅是解决模式识别问题; （b）用直观的物理学和心理学理论进行基础学习，支持和丰富所学知识; （c）利用组合性和学习学习来快速获取知识并将其推广到新的任务和情境中。我们建议实现这些目标的具体挑战和有希望的路线，可以将近期神经网络进步的优势与更多结构化的认知模型相结合。
