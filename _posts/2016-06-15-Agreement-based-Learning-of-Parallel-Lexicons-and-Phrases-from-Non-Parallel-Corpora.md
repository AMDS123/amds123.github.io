##### Abstract
We introduce an agreement-based approach to learning parallel lexicons and phrases from non-parallel corpora. The basic idea is to encourage two asymmetric latent-variable translation models (i.e., source-to-target and target-to-source) to agree on identifying latent phrase and word alignments. The agreement is defined at both word and phrase levels. We develop a Viterbi EM algorithm for jointly training the two unidirectional models efficiently. Experiments on the Chinese-English dataset show that agreement-based learning significantly improves both alignment and translation performance.

我们介绍一种基于协议的方法来学习平行语料库和来自非平行语料库的短语。其基本思想是鼓励两个不对称的潜变量模型（即源到目标和目标到源）共同识别潜在的短语​​和字对齐。这个协议是在单词和短语两个层面上定义的。我们开发了一个Viterbi EM算法来有效地联合训练这两个单向模型。汉英数据集的实验表明，基于协议的学习能显着提高对齐和翻译的性能。
