##### Abstract
Understanding physical phenomena is a key competence that enables humans and animals to act and interact under uncertain perception in previously unseen environments containing novel object and their configurations. Developmental psychology has shown that such skills are acquired by infants from observations at a very early stage. In this paper, we contrast a more traditional approach of taking a model-based route with explicit 3D representations and physical simulation by an end-to-end approach that directly predicts stability and related quantities from appearance. We ask the question if and to what extent and quality such a skill can directly be acquired in a data-driven way bypassing the need for an explicit simulation. We present a learning-based approach based on simulated data that predicts stability of towers comprised of wooden blocks under different conditions and quantities related to the potential fall of the towers. The evaluation is carried out on synthetic data and compared to human judgments on the same stimuli.

理解物理现象是一个关键的能力，使人类和动物能够在以前看不见的环境中，在包含新物体和它们的配置的不确定感知下行动和相互作用。发育心理学表明，这种技能是在很早的阶段由观察婴儿获得的。在本文中，我们比较了一种更传统的方法，即采用基于模型的路线与明确的3D表示和物理模拟，通过直接从外观预测稳定性和相关量的端到端方法。我们问这个问题是否可以直接以数据驱动的方式获得这种技能的程度和质量，而忽略了对显式模拟的需求。我们提出了一种基于模拟数据的基于学习的方法，该模拟数据预测在不同的条件和数量的木块组成的塔的稳定性与塔的潜在的秋天有关。对合成数据进行评估，并与相同刺激的人类判断进行比较。
