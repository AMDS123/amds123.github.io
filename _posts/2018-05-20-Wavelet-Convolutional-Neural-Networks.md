##### Abstract
Spatial and spectral approaches are two major approaches for image processing tasks such as image classification and object recognition. Among many such algorithms, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have recently achieved significant performance improvement in many challenging tasks. Since CNNs process images directly in the spatial domain, they are essentially spatial approaches. Given that spatial and spectral approaches are known to have different characteristics, it will be interesting to incorporate a spectral approach into CNNs. We propose a novel CNN architecture, wavelet CNNs, which combines a multiresolution analysis and CNNs into one model. Our insight is that a CNN can be viewed as a limited form of a multiresolution analysis. Based on this insight, we supplement missing parts of the multiresolution analysis via wavelet transform and integrate them as additional components in the entire architecture. Wavelet CNNs allow us to utilize spectral information which is mostly lost in conventional CNNs but useful in most image processing tasks. We evaluate the practical performance of wavelet CNNs on texture classification and image annotation. The experiments show that wavelet CNNs can achieve better accuracy in both tasks than existing models while having significantly fewer parameters than conventional CNNs.

空间和光谱方法是图像处理任务的两种主要方法，例如图像分类和对象识别。在许多此类算法中，卷积神经网络（CNN）最近在许多具有挑战性的任务中取得了显着的性能提升。由于CNN直接在空间域处理图像，它们本质上是空间方法。由于已知空间和光谱方法具有不同的特征，因此将频谱方法纳入CNN将是有趣的。我们提出了一种新颖的CNN架构，即小波CNN，它将多分辨率分析和CNN组合成一个模型。我们的见解是，CNN可以被看作是多分辨率分析的有限形式。基于这种见解，我们通过小波变换补充了多分辨率分析的缺失部分，并将它们作为整个架构中的附加组件进行整合。小波CNN允许我们利用在常规CNN中大部分丢失但在大多数图像处理任务中有用的频谱信息。我们评估小波CNNs在纹理分类和图像注释上的实际性能。实验表明，小波CNNs可以比现有模型在两种任务中获得更好的精确度，而参数比传统的CNN少得多。
