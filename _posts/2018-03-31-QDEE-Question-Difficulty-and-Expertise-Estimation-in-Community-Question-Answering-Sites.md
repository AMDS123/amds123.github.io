##### Abstract
In this paper, we present a framework for Question Difficulty and Expertise Estimation (QDEE) in Community Question Answering sites (CQAs) such as Yahoo! Answers and Stack Overflow, which tackles a fundamental challenge in crowdsourcing: how to appropriately route and assign questions to users with the suitable expertise. This problem domain has been the subject of much research and includes both language-agnostic as well as language conscious solutions. We bring to bear a key language-agnostic insight: that users gain expertise and therefore tend to ask as well as answer more difficult questions over time. We use this insight within the popular competition (directed) graph model to estimate question difficulty and user expertise by identifying key hierarchical structure within said model. An important and novel contribution here is the application of "social agony" to this problem domain. Difficulty levels of newly posted questions (the cold-start problem) are estimated by using our QDEE framework and additional textual features. We also propose a model to route newly posted questions to appropriate users based on the difficulty level of the question and the expertise of the user. Extensive experiments on real world CQAs such as Yahoo! Answers and Stack Overflow data demonstrate the improved efficacy of our approach over contemporary state-of-the-art models. The QDEE framework also allows us to characterize user expertise in novel ways by identifying interesting patterns and roles played by different users in such CQAs.

在本文中，我们提出了社区问答网站（CQA）中的问题难度和专业技能估计（QDEE）框架，如Yahoo!答案和堆栈溢出，解决了众包中的根本挑战：如何适当地发送问题并将问题分配给具有适当专业知识的用户。这个问题领域一直是许多研究的主题，包括语言不可知以及有语言意识的解决方案。我们带来了一个关键的语言不可知论的洞察力：用户获得专业知识，因此倾向于随着时间的推移回答更多难题。我们在流行的竞争（定向）图模型中使用这种洞察力，通过识别所述模型中的关键分层​​结构来估计问题难度和用户专业知识。这里一个重要和新颖的贡献是对这个问题领域的“社会痛苦”的应用。通过使用我们的QDEE框架和其他文本特征来估计新发布的问题难度（冷启动问题）。我们还提出了一个模型，根据问题的难易程度和用户的专业知识，将新发布的问题发送给适当的用户。对现实世界CQA进行大量实验，例如Yahoo!答案和堆栈溢出数据证明了我们的方法相对于当代最先进的模型的改进的功效。 QDEE框架还允许我们通过识别不同用户在这些CQA中发挥的有趣模式和角色，以新颖的方式表征用户专业知识。
