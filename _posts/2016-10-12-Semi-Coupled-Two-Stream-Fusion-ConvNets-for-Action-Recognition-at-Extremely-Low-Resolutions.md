##### Abstract
Deep convolutional neural networks (ConvNets) have been recently shown to attain state-of-the-art performance for action recognition on standard-resolution videos. However, less attention has been paid to recognition performance at extremely low resolutions (eLR) (e.g., 16 x 12 pixels). Reliable action recognition using eLR cameras would address privacy concerns in various application environments such as private homes, hospitals, nursing/rehabilitation facilities, etc. In this paper, we propose a semi-coupled filter-sharing network that leverages high resolution (HR) videos during training in order to assist an eLR ConvNet. We also study methods for fusing spatial and temporal ConvNets customized for eLR videos in order to take advantage of appearance and motion information. Our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods at extremely low resolutions on IXMAS (93.7%) and HMDB (29.2%) datasets.

最近，深度卷积神经网络（ConvNets）被证明可以获得标准分辨率视频动作识别的最新性能。然而，在极低分辨率（eLR）（例如，16×12像素）下对识别性能的关注较少。使用eLR摄像机进行可靠的动作识别将解决私人住宅，医院，护理/康复设施等各种应用环境中的隐私问题。本文中，我们提出了一个半耦合滤波器共享网络，利用高分辨率（HR）视频在培训期间，以协助eLR ConvNet。我们还研究融合eLR视频定制的空间和时间ConvNets的方法，以利用外观和运动信息。我们的方法在IXMAS（93.7％）和HMDB（29.2％）数据集的极低分辨率下胜过最先进的方法。
