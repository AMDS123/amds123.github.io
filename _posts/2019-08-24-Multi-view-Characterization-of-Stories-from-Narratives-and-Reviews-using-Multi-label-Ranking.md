##### Abstract
This paper considers the problem of characterizing stories by inferring attributes like theme and genre using the written narrative and user reviews. We experiment with a multi-label dataset of narratives representing the story of movies and a tagset representing various attributes of stories. To identify the story attributes, we propose a hierarchical representation of narratives that improves over the traditional feature-based machine learning methods as well as sequential representation approaches. Finally, we demonstrate a multi-view method for discovering story attributes from user opinions in reviews that are complementary to the gold standard data set.
