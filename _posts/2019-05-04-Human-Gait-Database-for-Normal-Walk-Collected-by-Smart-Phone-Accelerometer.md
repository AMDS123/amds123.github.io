##### Abstract
The goal of this study is to introduce a comprehensive gait database of 93 human subjects who walked between two end points during two different sessions and record their gait data using two smart phones, one was attached to right thigh and another one on left side of waist. This data is collected with intention to be utilized by deep learning-based method which requires enough time points. The meta data including age, gender, smoking, daily exercise time, height, and weight of an individual is recorded. this data set is publicly available.
