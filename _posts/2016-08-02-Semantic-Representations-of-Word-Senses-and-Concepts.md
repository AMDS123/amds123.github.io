##### Abstract
Representing the semantics of linguistic items in a machine-interpretable form has been a major goal of Natural Language Processing since its earliest days. Among the range of different linguistic items, words have attracted the most research attention. However, word representations have an important limitation: they conflate different meanings of a word into a single vector. Representations of word senses have the potential to overcome this inherent limitation. Indeed, the representation of individual word senses and concepts has recently gained in popularity with several experimental results showing that a considerable performance improvement can be achieved across different NLP applications upon moving from word level to the deeper sense and concept levels. Another interesting point regarding the representation of concepts and word senses is that these models can be seamlessly applied to other linguistic items, such as words, phrases and sentences.

##### Abstract (translated by Google)
以机器可解释的形式来表示语言项目的语义已经成为自然语言处理从最初的日子起的一个主要目标。在不同的语言项目范围内，词汇吸引了最多的研究关注。然而，单词表示有一个重要的局限性：它们将一个单词的不同含义混合成一个单独的矢量。词义的表示有可能克服这个固有的限制。事实上，单个词义和概念的表现最近已经流行起来，几个实验结果表明，当从单词级别转换到更深层次的意义和概念级别时，在不同的NLP应用中可以实现显着的性能改进。关于概念和词义的表示的另一个有趣的观点是，这些模型可以无缝地应用于其他语言项目，例如单词，短语和句子。
