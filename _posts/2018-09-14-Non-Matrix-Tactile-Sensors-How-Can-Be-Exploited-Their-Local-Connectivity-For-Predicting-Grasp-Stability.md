##### Abstract
Tactile sensors supply useful information during the interaction with an object that can be used for assessing the stability of a grasp. Most of the previous works on this topic processed tactile readings as signals by calculating hand-picked features. Some of them have processed these readings as images calculating characteristics on matrix-like sensors. In this work, we explore how non-matrix sensors (sensors with taxels not arranged exactly in a matrix) can be processed as tactile images as well. In addition, we prove that they can be used for predicting grasp stability by training a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with them. We captured over 2500 real three-fingered grasps on 41 everyday objects to train a CNN that exploited the local connectivity inherent on the non-matrix tactile sensors, achieving 94.2% F1-score on predicting stability.

触觉传感器在与物体相互作用期间提供有用信息，该物体可用于评估抓握的稳定性。之前关于该主题的大部分工作都是通过计算手工挑选的特征将触觉读数作为信号处理。他们中的一些人已经将这些读数处理为计算矩阵状传感器特征的图像。在这项工作中，我们探讨了如何将非矩阵传感器（没有精确排列在矩阵中的紫杉醇传感器）作为触觉图像处理。此外，我们通过训练卷积神经网络（CNN）证明它们可用于预测抓握稳定性。我们在41个日常物体上捕获了超过2500个真正的三指抓取来训练CNN，该CNN利用非矩阵触觉传感器固有的局部连接，在预测稳定性方面达到94.2％的F1得分。
