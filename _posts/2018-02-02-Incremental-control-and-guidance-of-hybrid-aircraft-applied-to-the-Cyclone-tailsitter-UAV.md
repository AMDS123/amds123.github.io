##### Abstract
Hybrid unmanned aircraft, that combine hover capability with a wing for fast and efficient forward flight, have attracted a lot of attention in recent years. Many different designs are proposed, but one of the most promising is the tailsitter concept. However, tailsitters are difficult to control across the entire flight envelope, which often includes stalled flight. Additionally, their wing surface makes them susceptible to wind gusts. In this paper, we propose incremental nonlinear dynamic inversion control for the attitude and position control. The result is a single, continuous controller, that is able to track the acceleration of the vehicle across the flight envelope. The proposed controller is implemented on the Cyclone hybrid UAV. Multiple outdoor experiments are performed, showing that unmodeled forces and moments are effectively compensated by the incremental control structure, and that accelerations can be tracked across the flight envelope. Finally, we provide a comprehensive procedure for the implementation of the controller on other types of hybrid UAVs.

混合无人驾驶飞机将飞行能力与机翼相结合，快速高效地向前飞行，近年来备受关注。提出了许多不同的设计，但其中最有前途的是taililsitter概念。然而，在整个飞行包线上，尾巴难以控制，这往往包括停飞的飞行。另外，他们的机翼表面使他们容易受风阵风。在本文中，我们提出增量非线性动态反转控制的姿态和位置控制。其结果是一个单一的连续控制器，能够跟踪飞行包线上的车辆加速度。所提出的控制器在Cyclone混合型无人机上实现。进行多个室外实验，显示未建模的力和力矩可以通过增量控制结构得到有效补偿，并且可以在飞行包线上追踪加速度。最后，我们为其他类型的混合型无人机实施控制器提供了一个全面的程序。
