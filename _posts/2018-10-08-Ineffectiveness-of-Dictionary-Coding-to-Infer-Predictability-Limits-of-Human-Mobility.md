##### Abstract
Recently, a series of models have been proposed to predict future movements of people. Meanwhile, dictionary coding algorithms are used to estimate the predictability limit of human mobility. Although dictionary coding is optimal, it takes long time to converge. Consequently, it is ineffective to infer predictability through dictionary coding algorithms. In this report, we illustrate this ineffectiveness on the basis of human movements in urban space.
