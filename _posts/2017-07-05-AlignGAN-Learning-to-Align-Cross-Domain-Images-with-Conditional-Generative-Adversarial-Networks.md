##### Abstract
Recently, several methods based on generative adversarial network (GAN) have been proposed for the task of aligning cross-domain images or learning a joint distribution of cross-domain images. One of the methods is to use conditional GAN for alignment. However, previous attempts of adopting conditional GAN do not perform as well as other methods. In this work we present an approach for improving the capability of the methods which are based on conditional GAN. We evaluate the proposed method on numerous tasks and the experimental results show that it is able to align the cross-domain images successfully in absence of paired samples. Furthermore, we also propose another model which conditions on multiple information such as domain information and label information. Conditioning on domain information and label information, we are able to conduct label propagation from the source domain to the target domain. A 2-step alternating training algorithm is proposed to learn this model.

近来，已经提出了几种基于生成对抗网络（GAN）的方法，用于对齐跨域图像或者学习跨域图像的联合分布。其中一种方法是使用条件GAN进行比对。然而，采用条件GAN的先前尝试不如其他方法那样好。在这项工作中，我们提出了一种方法来提高基于条件GAN的方法的能力。我们评估提出的方法在众多的任务和实验结果表明，它能够对齐的跨域图像成对样本的情况下成功。此外，我们还提出了另外一个模型，对域信息和标签信息等多重信息进行条件化。通过调整域信息和标签信息，我们能够从源域到目标域进行标签传播。提出了一种两步交替训练算法来学习该模型。
