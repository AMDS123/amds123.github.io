##### Abstract
Road extraction from very high resolution satellite images is one of the most important topics in the field of remote sensing. For the road segmentation problem, spatial properties of the data can usually be captured using Convolutional Neural Networks. However, this approach only considers a few local neighborhoods at a time and has difficulty capturing long-range dependencies. In order to overcome the problem, we propose Non-Local LinkNet with non-local blocks that can grasp relations between global features. It enables each spatial feature point to refer to all other contextual information and results in more accurate road segmentation. In detail, our method achieved 65.00\% mIOU scores on the DeepGlobe 2018 Road Extraction Challenge dataset. Our best model outperformed D-LinkNet, 1st-ranked solution, by a significant gap of mIOU 0.88\% with much less number of parameters. We also present empirical analyses on proper usage of non-local blocks for the baseline model.
