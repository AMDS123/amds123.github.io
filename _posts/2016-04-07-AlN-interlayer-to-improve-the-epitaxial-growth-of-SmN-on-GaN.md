##### Abstract
An in situ study of the epitaxial growth of SmN thin films on Ga-polar GaN (0001)templates by molecular beam epitaxy is reported. Using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy we found that Ga segregates at the surface during the first stages of growth. We showed that the problem related to Ga surface segregation can be simply suppressed by growing a few monolayers of AlN before starting the SmN growth. This results in a significant improvement of the crystallinity of SmN thin films assessed by X-ray diffraction.
