##### Abstract
While open-domain question answering (QA) systems have proven effective for answering simple questions, they struggle with more complex questions. Our goal is to answer more complex questions reliably, without incurring a significant cost in knowledge resource construction to support the QA. One readily available knowledge resource is a term bank, enumerating the key concepts in a domain. We have developed an unsupervised learning approach that leverages a term bank to guide a QA system, by representing the terminological knowledge with thousands of specialized vector spaces. In experiments with complex science questions, we show that this approach significantly outperforms several state-of-the-art QA systems, demonstrating that significant leverage can be gained from continuous vector representations of domain terminology.

虽然开放域问答（QA）系统在回答简单问题方面已被证明是有效的，但它们却面临着更复杂的问题。我们的目标是可靠地回答更复杂的问题，而不需要花费大量的知识资源建设来支持QA。一个现成的知识资源是一个术语库，列举了一个领域的关键概念。我们已经开发了一种无监督的学习方法，利用术语库来指导一个QA系统，通过用数以千计的专业向量空间表示术语知识。在复杂的科学问题的实验中，我们显示这种方法明显优于几个最先进的QA系统，证明了从连续的领域术语的矢量表示中可以获得显着的影响力。
