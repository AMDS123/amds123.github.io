##### Abstract
We elaborate a quantum model for the meaning associated with corpora of written documents, like the pages forming the World Wide Web. To that end, we are guided by how physicists constructed quantum theory for microscopic entities, which unlike classical objects cannot be fully represented in our spatial theater. We suggest that a similar construction needs to be carried out by linguists and computational scientists, to capture the full meaning carried by collections of documental entities. More precisely, we show how to associate a quantum-like 'entity of meaning' to a 'language entity formed by printed documents', considering the latter as the collection of traces that are left by the former, in specific results of search actions that we describe as measurements. In other words, we offer a perspective where a collection of documents, like the Web, is described as the space of manifestation of a more complex entity - the QWeb - which is the object of our modeling, drawing its inspiration from previous studies on operational-realistic approaches to quantum physics and quantum modeling of human cognition and decision-making. We emphasize that a consistent QWeb model needs to account for the observed correlations between words appearing in printed documents, e.g., co-occurrences, as the latter would depend on the 'meaning connections' existing between the concepts that are associated with these words. In that respect, we show that both 'context and interference (quantum) effects' are required to explain the probabilities calculated by counting the relative number of documents containing certain words and co-ocurrrences of words.

我们为与书面文档的语料库相关的含义（如形成万维网的页面）阐述了一个量子模型。为此，我们以物理学家如何为微观实体构建量子理论为指导，这些实体与经典物体不同，不能在我们的空间影院中充分表现出来。我们认为，语言学家和计算科学家需要进行类似的构建，以获取文献实体收集的全部意义。更确切地说，我们展示了如何将类似量子的“意义实体”与由印刷文档形成的语言实体联系起来，将后者视为前者留下的痕迹的集合，在搜索行为的具体结果中我们将其描述为度量。换句话说，我们提供了一个观点，像Web这样的文档集合被描述为一个更复杂实体的表现空间 -  QWeb  - 这是我们建模的对象，从以前的操作研究中吸取灵感量子物理学的实用方法和人类认知与决策的量子建模。我们强调，一个一致的QWeb模型需要考虑在印刷文档中出现的单词之间的观察到的相关性，例如共现，因为后者将取决于与这些单词相关的概念之间存在的“意义连接”。在这方面，我们表明，需要“背景和干扰（量子）效应”来解释通过计算包含某些单词的文档的相对数量和单词的同时出现计算的概率。
