##### Abstract
The isiZulu verb is known for its morphological complexity, which is a subject for on-going linguistics research, as well as for prospects of computational use, such as controlled natural language interfaces, machine translation, and spellcheckers. To this end, we seek to answer the question as to what the precise grammar rules for the isiZulu complex verb are (and, by extension, the Bantu verb morphology). To this end, we iteratively specify the grammar as a Context Free Grammar, and evaluate it computationally. The grammar presented in this paper covers the subject and object concords, negation, present tense, aspect, mood, and the causative, applicative, stative, and the reciprocal verbal extensions, politeness, the wh-question modifiers, and aspect doubling, ensuring their correct order as they appear in verbs. The grammar conforms to specification.

isiZulu动词以其形态复杂性而闻名，这是一个正在进行的语言学研究的主题，也是计算使用的前景，如受控的自然语言界面，机器翻译和拼写检查。为此，我们试图回答关于isiZulu复合动词的精确语法规则（以及扩展Bantu动词形态）的问题。为此，我们迭代地将语法指定为上下文无关语法，并对其进行计算评估。本文提出的语法涵盖了主语和客体的一致，否定，现在时，方面，情绪，致使，应用，态度和相互的口头延伸，礼貌，问题修饰语和方面倍增，确保了它们正确的顺序，因为它们出现在动词中。语法符合规范。
