##### Abstract
In this paper we survey, analyze and criticize current art on automated melanoma screening, reimplementing a baseline technique, and proposing two novel ones. Melanoma, although highly curable when detected early, ends as one of the most dangerous types of cancer, due to delayed diagnosis and treatment. Its incidence is soaring, much faster than the number of trained professionals able to diagnose it. Automated screening appears as an alternative to make the most of those professionals, focusing their time on the patients at risk while safely discharging the other patients. However, the potential of automated melanoma diagnosis is currently unfulfilled, due to the emphasis of current literature on outdated computer vision models. Even more problematic is the irreproducibility of current art. We show how streamlined pipelines based upon current Computer Vision outperform conventional models - a model based on an advanced bags of words reaches an AUC of 84.6%, and a model based on deep neural networks reaches 89.3%, while the baseline (a classical bag of words) stays at 81.2%. We also initiate a dialog to improve reproducibility in our community

在本文中，我们调查，分析和批评当前的黑色素瘤自动筛查技术，重新实施基准技术，并提出两个新的。黑色素瘤尽管在早期发现时具有很高的治愈率，但是由于延误诊断和治疗，最终成为最危险的癌症之一。它的发病率飞涨，比能够诊断的专业人员要快得多。自动化筛查似乎是替代这些专业人士的最佳选择，他们将时间安排在危险的患者身上，同时安全地排出其他患者。然而，由于当前文献对过时的计算机视觉模型的强调，自动黑素瘤诊断的潜力目前尚未得到满足。更有问题的是当前艺术的不可重现性。我们展示了基于当前计算机视觉的流水线如何优于传统模型 - 基于高级词袋的模型达到了84.6％的AUC，基于深度神经网络的模型达到了89.3％，而基线字）保持在81.2％。我们也发起一个对话来提高我们社区的可重复性
