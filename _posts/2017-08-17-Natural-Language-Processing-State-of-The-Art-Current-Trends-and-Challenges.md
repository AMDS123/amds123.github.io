##### Abstract
Natural language processing (NLP) has recently gained much attention for representing and analysing human language computationally. It has spread its applications in various fields such as machine translation, email spam detection, information extraction, summarization, medical, and question answering etc. The paper distinguishes four phases by discussing different levels of NLP and components of Natural Language Generation (NLG) followed by presenting the history and evolution of NLP, state of the art presenting the various applications of NLP and current trends and challenges.

##### Abstract (translated by Google)
自然语言处理（NLP）最近在计算表示和分析人类语言时倍受关注。它已经在机器翻译，垃圾邮件检测，信息抽取，摘要，医疗和问题回答等各个领域得到了广泛的应用。本文通过讨论不同层次的NLP和自然语言生成（NLG）组件，区分了四个阶段。通过介绍NLP的历史和演变，介绍NLP的各种应用以及当前的趋势和挑战。
