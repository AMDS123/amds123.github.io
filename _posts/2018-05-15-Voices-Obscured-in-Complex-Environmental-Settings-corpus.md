##### Abstract
This paper introduces the Voices Obscured In Complex Environmental Settings (VOICES) corpus, a freely available dataset under Creative Commons BY 4.0. This dataset will promote speech and signal processing research of speech recorded by far-field microphones in noisy room conditions. Publicly available speech corpora are mostly composed of isolated speech at close-range microphony. A typical approach to better represent realistic scenarios, is to convolve clean speech with noise and simulated room response for model training. Despite these efforts, model performance degrades when tested against uncurated speech in natural conditions. For this corpus, audio was recorded in furnished rooms with background noise played in conjunction with foreground speech selected from the LibriSpeech corpus. Multiple sessions were recorded in each room to accommodate for all foreground speech-background noise combinations. Audio was recorded using twelve microphones placed throughout the room, resulting in 120 hours of audio per microphone. This work is a multi-organizational effort led by SRI International and Lab41 with the intent to push forward state-of-the-art distant microphone approaches in signal processing and speech recognition.

本文介绍了复杂环境设置（VOICES）语料库中的声音，这是Creative Commons BY 4.0中免费提供的数据集。该数据集将促进在嘈杂的房间条件下由远场麦克风录制的语音的语音和信号处理研究。公开可用的语音语料库主要由近距离微距中的孤立语音组成。更好地代表现实场景的典型方法是将干净的语音与噪音以及模拟房间响应进行模型训练。尽管做出了这些努力，但在自然条件下测试未经准备的语音时，模型性能会降低。对于这个语料库，在装备过的房间录制音频，并伴随从LibriSpeech语料库中选择的前景语音播放背景噪音。每个房间都记录了多个会话以适应​​所有前景语音背景噪音组合。使用放置在房间内的十二个麦克风录制音频，每个麦克风的音频达到120小时。这项工作是由SRI International和Lab41领导的多组织努力，旨在推进信号处理和语音识别领域的最先进的远距离麦克风方法。
