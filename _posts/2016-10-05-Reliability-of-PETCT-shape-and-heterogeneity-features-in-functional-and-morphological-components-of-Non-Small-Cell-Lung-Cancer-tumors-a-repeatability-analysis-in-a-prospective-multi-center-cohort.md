##### Abstract
Purpose: The main purpose of this study was to assess the reliability of shape and heterogeneity features in both Positron Emission Tomography (PET) and low-dose Computed Tomography (CT) components of PET/CT. A secondary objective was to investigate the impact of image quantization.Material and methods: A Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act -compliant secondary analysis of deidentified prospectively acquired PET/CT test-retest datasets of 74 patients from multi-center Merck and ACRIN trials was performed. Metabolically active volumes were automatically delineated on PET with Fuzzy Locally Adaptive Bayesian algorithm. 3DSlicerTM was used to semi-automatically delineate the anatomical volumes on low-dose CT components. Two quantization methods were considered: a quantization into a set number of bins (quantizationB) and an alternative quantization with bins of fixed width (quantizationW). Four shape descriptors, ten first-order metrics and 26 textural features were computed. Bland-Altman analysis was used to quantify repeatability. Features were subsequently categorized as very reliable, reliable, moderately reliable and poorly reliable with respect to the corresponding volume variability. Results: Repeatability was highly variable amongst features. Numerous metrics were identified as poorly or moderately reliable. Others were (very) reliable in both modalities, and in all categories (shape, 1st-, 2nd- and 3rd-order metrics). Image quantization played a major role in the features repeatability. Features were more reliable in PET with quantizationB, whereas quantizationW showed better results in CT.Conclusion: The test-retest repeatability of shape and heterogeneity features in PET and low-dose CT varied greatly amongst metrics. The level of repeatability also depended strongly on the quantization step, with different optimal choices for each modality. The repeatability of PET and low-dose CT features should be carefully taken into account when selecting metrics to build multiparametric models.

目的：本研究的主要目的是评估正电子发射断层扫描（PET）和PET / CT低剂量计算机断层扫描（CT）成分的形状和异质性特征的可靠性。第二个目标是调查图像量化的影响。材料和方法：健康保险携带和责任法案 - 对来自多中心Merck和ACRIN试验的74例患者进行前瞻性收购的PET / CT重测数据集的二次分析，执行。采用模糊局部自适应贝叶斯算法在PET上自动描绘代谢活性体积。使用3DSlicerTM半自动描绘低剂量CT成分的解剖体积。考虑了两种量化方法：量化为一定数量的箱（量化B）和使用固定宽度的箱（量化W）的替代量化。计算四个形状描述符，十个一阶度量和26个纹理特征。使用Bland-Altman分析来量化重复性。随后将特征分类为非常可靠，可靠，适度可靠并且相对于相应的体积可变性不可靠。结果：特征之间的可重复性高度不同。许多指标被认定为不可靠或适度可靠。其他人在这两种模式，以及所有类别（形状，一阶，二阶和三阶度量）方面都非常可靠。图像量化在特征重复性中起主要作用。在量化B的情况下PET的特征更为可靠，而量化W在CT中的结果更好。结论：PET和低剂量CT的形状和异质性特征的重复测试重复性在不同的度量方面差异很大。可重复性水平也强烈地依赖于量化步骤，对于每种模式具有不同的最佳选择。在选择建立多参数模型的指标时，应仔细考虑PET和低剂量CT特征的可重复性。
