##### Abstract
The reconstructions of the Ga polarity GaN(0 0 0 1) surface with and without trace amounts of arsenic and prepared by molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) have been studied with in situ reflection high-energy electron diffraction (RHEED) and scanning tunneling microscopy (STM). Various reconstructions are observed with RHEED by analyzing patterns while the substrate is exposed to a fixed NH3 flux or after depositing known amounts of Ga as a function of substrate temperature. In situ STM images reveal that only a few of these reconstructions yield long-range periodicity in real space. The controversial role of arsenic on Ga induced reconstructions was also investigated using two independent MBE chambers and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy.
