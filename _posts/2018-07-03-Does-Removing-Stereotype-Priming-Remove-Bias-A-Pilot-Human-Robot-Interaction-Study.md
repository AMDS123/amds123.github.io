##### Abstract
Robots capable of participating in complex social interactions have shown great potential in a variety of applications. As these robots grow more popular, it is essential to continuously evaluate the dynamics of the human-robot relationship. One factor shown to have potential impacts on this critical relationship is the human projection of stereotypes onto social robots, a practice that is implicitly known to effect both developers and users of this technology. As such, in this research, we wished to investigate the difference in participants' perceptions of the robot interaction if we removed stereotype priming. This has not yet been a common practice in similar studies. Given the stereotypes of emotions among ethnic groups, especially in the U.S., this study specifically sought to investigate the impact that robot "skin color" could potentially have on the human perception of a robot's emotional expressive behavior. A between-subject experiment with 198 individuals was conducted. The results showed no significant differences in the overall emotion classification or intensity ratings for the different robot skin colors. These results lend credence to our hypothesis that when individuals are not primed with information related to human stereotypes, robots are evaluated based on functional attributes versus stereotypical attributes. This provides some confidence that robots, if designed correctly, can potentially be used as a tool to override stereotype-based biases associated with human behavior.

能够参与复杂社交互动的机器人在各种应用中显示出巨大的潜力。随着这些机器人越来越受欢迎，必须不断评估人机器人关系的动态。显示对这种关键关系具有潜在影响的一个因素是人类对社交机器人的刻板印象的投射，这种做法被隐含地知道影响该技术的开发者和用户。因此，在本研究中，我们希望研究参与者对机器人相互作用的看法的差异，如果我们删除了刻板印象。这在类似研究中尚未成为常见做法。鉴于族群之间的情绪刻板印象，特别是在美国，这项研究专门研究了机器人“肤色”可能对人类对机器人情绪表达行为的感知所带来的影响。进行了198名个体的受试者间实验。结果显示，不同机器人肤色的总体情绪分类或强度等级没有显着差异。这些结果证实了我们的假设，即当个体没有准备好与人类刻板印象相关的信息时，机器人会根据功能属性与刻板印象属性进行评估。这提供了一些信心，即机器人如果设计得当，可以潜在地用作覆盖与人类行为相关的基于刻板印象的偏见的工具。
