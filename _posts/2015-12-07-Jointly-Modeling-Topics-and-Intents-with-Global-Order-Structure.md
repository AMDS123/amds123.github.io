##### Abstract
Modeling document structure is of great importance for discourse analysis and related applications. The goal of this research is to capture the document intent structure by modeling documents as a mixture of topic words and rhetorical words. While the topics are relatively unchanged through one document, the rhetorical functions of sentences usually change following certain orders in discourse. We propose GMM-LDA, a topic modeling based Bayesian unsupervised model, to analyze the document intent structure cooperated with order information. Our model is flexible that has the ability to combine the annotations and do supervised learning. Additionally, entropic regularization can be introduced to model the significant divergence between topics and intents. We perform experiments in both unsupervised and supervised settings, results show the superiority of our model over several state-of-the-art baselines.

建模文档结构对话语分析和相关应用是非常重要的。本研究的目标是通过将文档建模为主题词和修辞词的混合来捕获文档意图结构。虽然通过一个文档的话题是相对不变的，但是句子的修辞功能通常会随着话语中的某些顺序而改变。我们提出了基于主题建模的贝叶斯无监督模型GMM-LDA来分析与订单信息相配合的文档意图结构。我们的模型是灵活的，有能力结合注释和做监督学习。另外，可以引入熵正则化来模拟主题和意图之间的显着差异。我们在无监督和监督设置下进行实验，结果显示我们的模型优于几个最先进的基线。
