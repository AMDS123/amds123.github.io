##### Abstract
We work on the task of automatically designing a treatment plan from the findings included in the medical certificate written by the dentist. To develop an artificial intelligence system that deals with free-form certificates written by dentists, we annotate the findings and utilized the natural language processing approach. As a result of the experiment using 990 certificates, 0.585 F1-score was achieved for the task of extracting orthodontic problems from findings, and 0.584 correlation coefficient with the human ranking was achieved for the treatment prioritization task.
