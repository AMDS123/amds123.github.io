##### Abstract
With the arrival of the big data era, more and more data are becoming readily available in various real world applications and those data are usually highly heterogeneous. Taking computational medicine as an example, we have both Electronic Health Records (EHR) and medical images for each patient. For complicated diseases such as Parkinson's and Alzheimer's, both EHR and neuroimaging information are very important for disease understanding because they contain complementary aspects of the disease. However, EHR and neuroimage are completely different. So far the existing research has been mainly focusing on one of them. In this paper, we proposed a framework, Memory-Based Graph Convolution Network (MemGCN), to perform integrative analysis with such multi-modal data. Specifically, GCN is used to extract useful information from the patients' neuroimages. The information contained in the patient EHRs before the acquisition of each brain image is captured by a memory network because of its sequential nature. The information contained in each brain image is combined with the information read out from the memory network to infer the disease state at the image acquisition timestamp. To further enhance the analytical power of MemGCN, we also designed a multi-hop strategy that allows multiple reading and updating on the memory can be performed at each iteration. We conduct experiments using the patient data from the Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative (PPMI) with the task of classification of Parkinson's Disease (PD) cases versus controls. We demonstrate that superior classification performance can be achieved with our proposed framework, comparing with existing approaches involving a single type of data.

随着大数据时代的到来，越来越多的数据在各种实际应用中变得容易获得，并且这些数据通常是高度异构的。以计算医学为例，我们为每位患者提供电子健康记录（EHR）和医学图像。对于帕金森氏症和阿尔茨海默氏症等复杂疾病，EHR和神经影像学信息对于疾病理解非常重要，因为它们包含疾病的互补方面。然而，EHR和神经图像完全不同。到目前为止，现有的研究主要集中在其中之一。在本文中，我们提出了一个框架，基于记忆的图形卷积网络（MemGCN），用这种多模态数据进行综合分析。具体而言，GCN用于从患者的神经图像中提取有用信息。由于其顺序性质，在获取每个脑图像之前包含在患者EHR中的信息由存储器网络捕获。将每个脑图像中包含的信息与从存储器网络读出的信息组合以推断图像获取时间戳处的疾病状态。为了进一步增强MemGCN的分析能力，我们还设计了一种多跳策略，允许在每次迭代时对存储器进行多次读取和更新。我们使用来自帕金森氏病进展标记计划（PPMI）的患者数据进行实验，其任务是帕金森病（PD）病例与对照的分类。我们证明，与涉及单一类型数据的现有方法相比，我们提出的框架可以实现卓越的分类性能。
