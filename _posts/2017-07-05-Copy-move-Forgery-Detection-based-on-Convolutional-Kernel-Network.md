##### Abstract
In this paper, a copy-move forgery detection method based on Convolutional Kernel Network is proposed. Different from methods based on conventional hand-crafted features, Convolutional Kernel Network is a kind of data-driven local descriptor with the deep convolutional structure. Thanks to the development of deep learning theories and widely available datasets, the data-driven methods can achieve competitive performance on different conditions for its excellent discriminative capability. Besides, our Convolutional Kernel Network is reformulated as a series of matrix computations and convolutional operations which are easy to parallelize and accelerate by GPU, leading to high efficiency. Then, appropriate preprocessing and postprocessing for Convolutional Kernel Network are adopted to achieve copy-move forgery detection. Particularly, a segmentation-based keypoints distribution strategy is proposed and a GPU-based adaptive oversegmentation method is adopted. Numerous experiments are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of the GPU version of Convolutional Kernel Network, and the state-of-the-art performance of the proposed copy-move forgery detection method based on Convolutional Kernel Network.

本文提出了一种基于卷积核的网络复制伪造检测方法。与基于传统手工特征的方法不同，卷积核心网络是一种具有深卷积结构的数据驱动局部描述符。由于深度学习理论的发展和广泛使用的数据集，数据驱动的方法可以在不同的条件下获得具有优异判别能力的竞争性能。此外，我们的卷积核心网络被重新表述为一系列矩阵计算和卷积运算，它们易于GPU并行化和加速，从而提高效率。然后，对卷积核网络进行适当的预处理和后处理，实现复制移动伪造检测。特别是提出了一种基于分割的关键点分布策略，并采用了基于GPU的自适应阈值分割方法。为了验证GPU版本的卷积核心网络的有效性和鲁棒性以及基于卷积核心网络的复制移动伪造检测方法的最新性能，进行了大量的实验。
