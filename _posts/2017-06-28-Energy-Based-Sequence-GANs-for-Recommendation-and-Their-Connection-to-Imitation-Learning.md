##### Abstract
Recommender systems aim to find an accurate and efficient mapping from historic data of user-preferred items to a new item that is to be liked by a user. Towards this goal, energy-based sequence generative adversarial nets (EB-SeqGANs) are adopted for recommendation by learning a generative model for the time series of user-preferred items. By recasting the energy function as the feature function, the proposed EB-SeqGANs is interpreted as an instance of maximum-entropy imitation learning.

推荐系统旨在从用户首选项目的历史数据到用户喜欢的新项目中找到准确和有效的映射。为了实现这一目标，通过学习用户首选项目时间序列的生成模型，采用基于能量的序列生成对抗网络（EB-SeqGANs）进行推荐。通过将能量函数重构为特征函数，将所提出的EB-SeqGANs解释为最大熵模仿学习的一个实例。
