##### Abstract
Soft robotics is an emerging field of research where the robot body is composed of compliant and soft materials. It allows the body to bend, twist, and deform to move or to adapt its shape to the environment for grasping, all of which are difficult for traditional hard robots with rigid bodies. However, the theoretical basis and design principles for soft robotics are not well-founded despite their recognized importance. For example, the control of soft robots is outsourced to morphological attributes and natural processes; thus, the coupled relations between a robot and its environment are particularly crucial. In this paper, we propose a mathematical foundation for soft robotics based on category theory, which is a branch of abstract math where any notions can be described by objects and arrows. It allows for a rigorous description of the inherent characteristics of soft robots and their relation to the environment as well as the differences compared to conventional hard robots. We present a notion called the category of mobility that well describes the subject matter. The theory was applied to a model system and analysis to highlight the adaptation behavior observed in universal grippers, which are a typical example of soft robotics. This paper paves the way to developing a theoretical background and design principles for soft robotics.

软机器人技术是一个新兴的研究领域，其机器人主体由柔软且柔软的材料组成。它允许身体弯曲，扭曲和变形以移动或适应其环境的抓取形式，所有这些对于具有刚体的传统硬机器人来说都很困难。然而，尽管软件机器人具有公认的重要性，但其理论基础和设计原则并不完善。例如，软机器人的控制外包给形态属性和自然过程;因此，机器人与其环境之间的耦合关系尤为重要。在本文中，我们提出了一个基于类别理论的软机器人的数学基础，它是抽象数学的一个分支，任何概念都可以用对象和箭头来描述。它允许对软机器人的固有特性及其与环境的关系以及与传统硬机器人相比的差异进行严格描述。我们提出一个被称为移动范畴的概念，它很好地描述了这个主题。该理论被应用于模型系统和分析，以突出在通用夹具中观察到的适应行为，这是软机器人的典型例子。本文为开发软机器人的理论背景和设计原则铺平了道路。
