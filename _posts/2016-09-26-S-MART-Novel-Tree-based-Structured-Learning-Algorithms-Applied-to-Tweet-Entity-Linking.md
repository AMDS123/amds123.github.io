##### Abstract
Non-linear models recently receive a lot of attention as people are starting to discover the power of statistical and embedding features. However, tree-based models are seldom studied in the context of structured learning despite their recent success on various classification and ranking tasks. In this paper, we propose S-MART, a tree-based structured learning framework based on multiple additive regression trees. S-MART is especially suitable for handling tasks with dense features, and can be used to learn many different structures under various loss functions. We apply S-MART to the task of tweet entity linking --- a core component of tweet information extraction, which aims to identify and link name mentions to entities in a knowledge base. A novel inference algorithm is proposed to handle the special structure of the task. The experimental results show that S-MART significantly outperforms state-of-the-art tweet entity linking systems.

最近非线性模型受到很多关注，因为人们开始发现统计和嵌入功能的力量。然而，基于树的模型很少在结构化学习的背景下研究，尽管他们最近在各种分类和排序任务上取得了成功。在本文中，我们提出了基于多元叠加回归树的S-MART，一种基于树的结构化学习框架。 S-MART特别适用于处理密集特征的任务，可用于学习各种损失函数下的多种不同结构。我们将S-MART应用于tweet实体链接任务 -  tweet信息提取的核心组件，旨在识别和链接知识库中的实体。提出了一种新的推理算法来处理任务的特殊结构。实验结果显示，S-MART明显优于最先进的tweet实体链接系统。
