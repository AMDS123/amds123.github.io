##### Abstract
With the recent advancements in Image Processing Techniques and development of new robust computer vision algorithms, new areas of research within Medical Diagnosis and Biomedical Engineering are picking up pace. This paper provides a comprehensive in-depth case study of Image Processing, Feature Extraction and Analysis of Apical Periodontitis diagnostic cases in IOPA (Intra Oral Peri-Apical) Radiographs, a common case in oral diagnostic pipeline. This paper provides a detailed analytical approach towards improving the diagnostic procedure with improved and faster results with higher accuracy targeting to eliminate True Negative and False Positive cases.
