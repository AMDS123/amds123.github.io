##### Abstract
Femtosecond pump-probe (PP) differential reflectivity spectroscopy (DRS) and four-wave mixing (FWM) experiments were performed simultaneously to study the initial temporal dynamics of the exciton line-shapes in GaN epilayers. Beats between the A-B excitons were found \textit{only for positive time delay} in both PP and FWM experiments. The rise time at negative time delay for the differential reflection spectra was much slower than the FWM signal or PP differential transmission spectroscopy (DTS) at the exciton resonance. A numerical solution of a six band semiconductor Bloch equation model including nonlinearities at the Hartree-Fock level shows that this slow rise in the DRS results from excitation induced dephasing (EID), that is, the strong density dependence of the dephasing time which changes with the laser excitation energy.
