##### Abstract
The problem of automated crowd segmentation and counting has garnered significant interest in the field of video surveillance. This paper proposes a novel scene invariant crowd segmentation and counting algorithm designed with high accuracy yet low computational complexity in mind, which is key for widespread industrial adoption. A novel low-complexity, scale-normalized feature called Histogram of Moving Gradients (HoMG) is introduced for highly effective spatiotemporal representation of individuals and crowds within a video. Real-time crowd segmentation is achieved via boosted cascade of weak classifiers based on sliding-window HoMG features, while linear SVM regression of crowd-region HoMG features is employed for real-time crowd counting. Experimental results using multi-camera crowd datasets show that the proposed algorithm significantly outperform state-of-the-art crowd counting algorithms, as well as achieve very promising crowd segmentation results, thus demonstrating the efficacy of the proposed method for highly-accurate, real-time video-driven crowd analysis.

自动化人群分割和计数的问题引起了视频监控领域的重大兴趣。本文提出了一种高精度，低计算复杂度的新型场景不变人群分割和计数算法，这是业界普遍采用的关键。引入了一种称为移动梯度直方图（HoMG）的新型低复杂度，尺度归一化特征，用于视频中个体和人群的高效时空表示。实时人群分割是通过基于滑动窗HoMG特征的弱分类器的增强级联实现的，而人群区域HoMG特征的线性SVM回归用于实时人群计数。使用多摄像机人群数据集的实验结果表明，所提出的算法明显优于现有技术的人群统计算法，并且实现了非常有希望的人群分割结果，因此证明了所提出的方法对高精度，真实时间视频驱动的人群分析。
