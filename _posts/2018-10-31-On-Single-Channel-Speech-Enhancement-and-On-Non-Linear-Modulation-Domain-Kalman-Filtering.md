##### Abstract
This report focuses on algorithms that perform single-channel speech enhancement. The author of this report uses modulation-domain Kalman filtering algorithms for speech enhancement, i.e. noise suppression and dereverberation, in [1], [2], [3], [4] and [5]. Modulation-domain Kalman filtering can be applied for both noise and late reverberation suppression and in [2], [1], [3] and [4], various model-based speech enhancement algorithms that perform modulation-domain Kalman filtering are designed, implemented and tested. The model-based enhancement algorithm in [2] estimates and tracks the speech phase. The short-time-Fourier-transform-based enhancement algorithm in [5] uses the active speech level estimator presented in [6]. This report describes how different algorithms perform speech enhancement and the algorithms discussed in this report are addressed to researchers interested in monaural speech enhancement. The algorithms are composed of different processing blocks and techniques [7]; understanding the implementation choices made during the system design is important because this provides insights that can assist the development of new algorithms. Index Terms - Speech enhancement, dereverberation, denoising, Kalman filter, minimum mean squared error estimation.
