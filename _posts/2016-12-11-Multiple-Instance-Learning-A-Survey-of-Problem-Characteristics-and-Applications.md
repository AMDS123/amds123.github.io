##### Abstract
Multiple instance learning (MIL) is a form of weakly supervised learning where training instances are arranged in sets, called bags, and a label is provided for the entire bag. This formulation is gaining interest because it naturally fits various problems and allows to leverage weakly labeled data. Consequently, it has been used in diverse application fields such as computer vision and document classification. However, learning from bags raises important challenges that are unique to MIL. This paper provides a comprehensive survey of the characteristics which define and differentiate the types of MIL problems. Until now, these problem characteristics have not been formally identified and described. As a result, the variations in performance of MIL algorithms from one data set to another are difficult to explain. In this paper, MIL problem characteristics are grouped into four broad categories: the composition of the bags, the types of data distribution, the ambiguity of instance labels, and the task to be performed. Methods specialized to address each category are reviewed. Then, the extent to which these characteristics manifest themselves in key MIL application areas are described. Finally, experiments are conducted to compare the performance of 16 state-of-the-art MIL methods on selected problem characteristics. This paper provides insight on how the problem characteristics affect MIL algorithms, recommendations for future benchmarking and promising avenues for research.

多重实例学习（MIL）是一种弱监督式的学习形式，其训练实例被排列在一个集合中，称为行李，并为整个行李提供一个标签。这个公式引起了人们的兴趣，因为它自然适合各种问题，并且可以利用标记不准确的数据。因此，它已被用于多种应用领域，如计算机视觉和文档分类。然而，从书包学习提出了MIL独有的重要挑战。本文对定义和区分MIL类问题的特点进行了全面的考察。到目前为止，这些问题特征还没有被正式识别和描述。因此，从一个数据集到另一个数据集的MIL算法的性能变化难以解释。本文将MIL问题的特点分为四大类：包的构成，数据分布的类型，实例标签的模糊性以及要执行的任务。审查专门处理每个类别的方法。然后，描述这些特征在关键的MIL应用领域中表现出来的程度。最后，进行实验来比较16种最先进的MIL方法在选定问题特征上的表现。本文提供了有关如何影响MIL算法的问题特征，未来基准测试的建议和有希望的研究途径。
