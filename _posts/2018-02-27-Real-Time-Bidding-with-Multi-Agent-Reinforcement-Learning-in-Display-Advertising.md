##### Abstract
Real-time advertising allows advertisers to bid for each impression for a visiting user. To optimize a specific goal such as maximizing the revenue led by ad placements, advertisers not only need to estimate the relevance between the ads and user's interests, but most importantly require a strategic response with respect to other advertisers bidding in the market. In this paper, we formulate bidding optimization with multi-agent reinforcement learning. To deal with a large number of advertisers, we propose a clustering method and assign each cluster with a strategic bidding agent. A practical Distributed Coordinated Multi-Agent Bidding (DCMAB) has been proposed and implemented to balance the tradeoff between the competition and cooperation among advertisers. The empirical study on our industry-scaled real-world data has demonstrated the effectiveness of our modeling methods. Our results show that a cluster based bidding would largely outperform single-agent and bandit approaches, and the coordinated bidding achieves better overall objectives than the purely self-interested bidding agents.

实时广告允许广告客户针对访问用户的每次展示进行出价。为了优化特定目标，例如最大限度地提高广告展示位置带来的收入，广告客户不仅需要评估广告与用户兴趣之间的相关性，而且最重要的是需要针对其他广告客户在市场上出价进行战略响应。在本文中，我们用多智能体强化学习来制定投标优化。为了处理大量的广告客户，我们提出了一种聚类方法，并为每个群集分配一个战略投标代理。为了平衡广告商之间的竞争与合作之间的权衡，已经提出并实施了实际的分布式协调多代理商投标（DCMAB）。我们对行业规模的实际数据的实证研究证明了我们的建模方法的有效性。我们的研究结果表明，基于聚类的投标在很大程度上将超越单一代理和土匪方法，并且协调投标达到比纯粹自利投标代理更好的总体目标。
