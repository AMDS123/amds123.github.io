##### Abstract
Despite the 'apparent clarity' of a given legal provision, its application may result in an outcome that does not exactly conform to the semantic level of a statute. The vagueness within a legal text is induced intentionally to accommodate all possible scenarios under which such norms should be applied, thus making the role of pragmatics an important aspect also in the representation of a legal norm and reasoning on top of it. The notion of pragmatics considered in this paper does not focus on the aspects associated with judicial decision making. The paper aims to shed light on the aspects of pragmatics in legal linguistics, mainly focusing on the domain of patent law, only from a knowledge representation perspective. The philosophical discussions presented in this paper are grounded based on the legal theories from Grice and Marmor.

##### Abstract (translated by Google)
尽管给定法律规定的“明显”，但其适用可能会导致一个结果不完全符合法律的语义层面。法律文本中的模糊性被有意诱导，以适应应用这种规范的所有可能的场景，从而使得语用学的角色也成为法律规范和推理之上的一个重要方面。本文所考虑的语用学概念并不关注与司法决策有关的方面。本文旨在阐明法律语言学中的语用学方面，主要侧重于专利法领域，仅从知识表示的角度出发。本文的哲学讨论是基于格赖斯和马莫尔的法律理论基础的。
