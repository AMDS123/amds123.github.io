##### Abstract
Fuzzy relation equations (FRE)are associated with the composition of binary fuzzy relations. In the present work FRE are used as a tool for studying the process of learning a new subject matter by a student class. A classroom application and other csuitable examples connected to the student learning of the derivative are also presented illustrating our results and useful conclusions are obtained.
