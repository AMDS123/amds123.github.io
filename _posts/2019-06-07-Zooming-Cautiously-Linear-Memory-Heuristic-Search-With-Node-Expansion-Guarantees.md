##### Abstract
We introduce and analyze two parameter-free linear-memory tree search algorithms. Under mild assumptions we prove our algorithms are guaranteed to perform only a logarithmic factor more node expansions than A* when the search space is a tree. Previously, the best guarantee for a linear-memory algorithm under similar assumptions was achieved by IDA*, which in the worst case expands quadratically more nodes than in its last iteration. Empirical results support the theory and demonstrate the practicality and robustness of our algorithms. Furthermore, they are fast and easy to implement.
