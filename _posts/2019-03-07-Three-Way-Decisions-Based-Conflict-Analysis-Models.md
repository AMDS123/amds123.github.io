##### Abstract
Three-way decision theory, which trisects the universe with less risks or costs, is considered as a powerful mathematical tool for handling uncertainty in incomplete and imprecise information tables, and provides an effective tool for conflict analysis decision making in real-time situations. In this paper, we propose the concepts of the agreement, disagreement and neutral subsets of a strategy with two evaluation functions, which establish the three-way decisions-based conflict analysis models(TWDCAMs) for trisecting the universe of agents, and employ a pair of two-way decisions models to interpret the mechanism of the three-way decision rules for an agent. Subsequently, we develop the concepts of the agreement, disagreement and neutral strategies of an agent group with two evaluation functions, which build the TWDCAMs for trisecting the universe of issues, and take a couple of two-way decisions models to explain the mechanism of the three-way decision rules for an issue. Finally, we reconstruct Fan, Qi and Wei's conflict analysis models(FQWCAMs) and Sun, Ma and Zhao's conflict analysis models(SMZCAMs) with two evaluation functions, and interpret FQWCAMs and SMZCAMs with a pair of two-day decisions models, which illustrates that FQWCAMs and SMZCAMs are special cases of TWDCAMs.
