##### Abstract
We investigate Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to model one particular kind of image: frames from TV cartoons. Cartoons are particularly interesting because their visual appearance emphasizes the important semantic information about a scene while abstracting out the less important details, but each cartoon series has a distinctive artistic style that performs this abstraction in different ways. We consider a dataset consisting of images from two popular television cartoon series, Family Guy and The Simpsons. We examine the ability of GANs to generate images from each of these two domains, when trained independently as well as on both domains jointly. We find that generative models may be capable of finding semantic-level correspondences between these two image domains despite the unsupervised setting, even when the training data does not give labeled alignments between them.

##### Abstract (translated by Google)
我们调查生成敌对网络（GANs）来模拟一种特殊类型的图像：来自电视漫画的帧。漫画特别有趣，因为它们的视觉外观强调了关于场景的重要语义信息，同时抽象出不太重要的细节，但是每个漫画系列具有独特的艺术风格，以不同的方式执行这种抽象。我们考虑一个由两部流行电视连续剧“家庭盖伊”和“辛普森一家”的图片组成的数据集。我们研究了GAN从两个领域的每个领域生成图像的能力，这些领域在独立训练以及在两个领域共同训练。我们发现生成模型可能能够找到这两个图像域之间的语义水平对应，尽管无监督设置，即使训练数据不给它们之间的标记对齐。
