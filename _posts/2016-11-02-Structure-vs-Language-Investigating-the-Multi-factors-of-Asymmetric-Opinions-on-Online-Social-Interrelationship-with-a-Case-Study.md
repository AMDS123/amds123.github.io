##### Abstract
Though current researches often study the properties of online social relationship from an objective view, we also need to understand individuals' subjective opinions on their interrelationships in social computing studies. Inspired by the theories from sociolinguistics, the latest work indicates that interactive language can reveal individuals' asymmetric opinions on their interrelationship. In this work, in order to explain the opinions' asymmetry on interrelationship with more latent factors, we extend the investigation from single relationship to the structural context in online social network. We analyze the correlation between interactive language features and the structural context of interrelationships. The structural context of vertex, edges and triangles in social network are considered. With statistical analysis on Enron email dataset, we find that individuals' opinions (measured by interactive language features) on their interrelationship are related to some of their important structural context in social network. This result can help us to understand and measure the individuals' opinions on their interrelationship with more intrinsic information.

##### Abstract (translated by Google)
虽然目前的研究往往是从客观的角度研究网络社会关系的属性，但也需要理解个人对于社会计算研究中相互关系的主观看法。受到社会语言学理论的启发，最新研究表明，交互式语言可以揭示个体之间相互关系的不对称性。在这项工作中，为了解释意见之间的相互关系不对称与更多的潜在因素，我们将调查范围从单一关系扩展到在线社交网络的结构语境。我们分析互动语言特征与相互关系的结构背景之间的相关性。考虑社交网络中顶点，边和三角形的结构上下文。通过对安然电子邮件数据集进行统计分析，发现个人对互动关系的看法（以互动语言特征衡量）与社交网络中一些重要的结构语境有关。这个结果可以帮助我们更多的内在的信息来理解和衡量个人对他们之间的相互关系的看法。
