##### Abstract
We propose a novel unsupervised singing voice detection method which use single-channel Blind Audio Source Separation (BASS) algorithm as a preliminary step. To reach this goal, we investigate three promising BASS approaches which operate through a morphological filtering of the analyzed mixture spectrogram. The contributions of this paper are manyfold. First, the investigated BASS methods are reworded with the same formalism and we investigate their respective hyperparameters by numerical simulations. Second, we propose an extension of the KAM method for which we propose a novel training algorithm used to compute a source-specific kernel from a given isolated source signal. Second, the BASS methods are compared together in terms of source separation accuracy and in terms of singing voice detection accuracy when they are used in our new singing voice detection framework. Finally, we do an exhaustive singing voice detection evaluation for which we compare both supervised and unsupervised singing voice detection methods. Our comparison explores different combination of the proposed BASS methods with new features such as the new proposed KAM features and the scattering transform through a machine learning framework and also considers convolutional neural networks methods.

我们提出了一种使用单通道盲音频源分离（BASS）算法作为初步步骤的无监督的歌声检测方法。为了实现这一目标，我们调查了三种有前途的BASS方法，这些方法通过分析混合物谱图的形态学滤波来进行操作。本文的贡献有很多。首先，所调查的BASS方法用相同的形式重写，并且我们通过数值模拟研究它们各自的超参数。其次，我们提出了KAM方法的扩展，我们提出了一种新的训练算法，用于从给定的孤立源信号计算源特定的内核。其次，将BASS方法在声源分离精度和歌声检测准确度方面进行比较，当它们用于我们的新歌声检测框架时。最后，我们做了一个详尽的歌声检测评估，我们比较了有监听和无监听的歌声检测方法。我们的比较探讨了所提出的BASS方法与诸如新提出的KAM特征和通过机器学习框架的散射变换之类的新特征的不同组合，并且还考虑了卷积神经网络方法。
