##### Abstract
The use of visual information for the navigation of unmanned ground vehicles in a cross-country environment recently received great attention. However, until now, the use of textural information has been somewhat less effective than color or laser range information. This manuscript reviews the recent achievements in cross-country scene segmentation and addresses their shortcomings. It then describes a problem related to classification of high dimensional texture features. Finally, it compares three machine learning algorithms aimed at resolving this problem. The experimental results for each machine learning algorithm with the discussion of comparisons are given at the end of the manuscript.

##### Abstract (translated by Google)
最近，越野环境中使用视觉信息导航无人地面车辆受到高度重视。然而，到目前为止，纹理信息的使用比彩色或激光距离信息的效果要差一些。这份手稿回顾了近期在跨国场景分割方面取得的成就并解决了它们的不足之处。然后描述与高维纹理特征的分类有关的问题。最后，它比较了三种机器学习算法，旨在解决这个问题。在论文的最后给出了每个机器学习算法的实验结果和讨论的比较。
