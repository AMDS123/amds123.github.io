##### Abstract
Loop Closure Detection (LCD) has been proved to be extremely useful in global consistent visual Simultaneously Localization and Mapping (SLAM) and appearance-based robot relocalization. Methods exploiting binary features in bag of words representation have recently gained a lot of popularity for their efficiency, but suffer from low recall due to the inherent drawback that high dimensional binary feature descriptors lack well-defined centroids. In this paper, we propose a realtime LCD approach called MILD (Multi-Index Hashing for Loop closure Detection), in which image similarity is measured by feature matching directly to achieve high recall without introducing extra computational complexity with the aid of Multi-Index Hashing (MIH). A theoretical analysis of the approximate image similarity measurement using MIH is presented, which reveals the trade-off between efficiency and accuracy from a probabilistic perspective. Extensive comparisons with state-of-the-art LCD methods demonstrate the superiority of MILD in both efficiency and accuracy.

环路闭合检测（LCD）已被证明是非常有用的全球一致的视觉同时定位和映射（SLAM）和基于外观的机器人relocalization。由于二维特征描述符缺乏明确定义的质心，固有的缺点使得在文字表示中利用二进制特征的方法近来获得了很高的效率。在本文中，我们提出了一种称为MILD（多指数散列用于闭环检测）的实时LCD方法，其中通过特征匹配直接测量图像相似性以实现高回忆，而不借助于多指数散列引入额外的计算复杂性（MIH）。提出了利用MIH进行近似图像相似性度量的理论分析，从概率角度揭示了效率和精度之间的折衷。与最先进的LCD方法进行广泛的比较，证明了MILD在效率和准确性方面的优越性。
