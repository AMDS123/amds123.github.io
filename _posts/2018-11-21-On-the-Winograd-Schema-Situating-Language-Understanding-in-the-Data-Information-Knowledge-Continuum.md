##### Abstract
The Winograd Schema (WS) challenge has been proposed as an alternative to the Turing Test as a test for machine intelligence. In this short paper we "situate" the WS challenge in the data-information-knowledge continuum, suggesting in the process what a good WS is. Furthermore, we suggest that the WS is a special case of a more general phenomenon in language understanding, namely the phenomenon of the "missing text". In particular, we will argue that what we usually call thinking in the process of language understanding almost always involves discovering the missing text - text is rarely explicitly stated but is implicitly assumed as shared background knowledge. We therefore suggest extending the WS challenge to include tests beyond those involving reference resolution, including examples that require discovering the missing text in situations that are usually treated in computational linguistics under different labels, such as metonymy, quantifier scope ambiguity, lexical disambiguation, and co-predication, to name a few.
