##### Abstract
This paper focuses on the problem of explaining predictions of psychological attributes such as attractiveness, happiness, confidence and intelligence from face photographs using deep neural networks. Since psychological attribute datasets typically suffer from small sample sizes, we apply transfer learning with two base models to avoid overfitting. These models were trained on an age and gender prediction task, respectively. Using a novel explanation method we extract heatmaps that highlight the parts of the image most responsible for the prediction. We further observe that the explanation method provides important insights into the nature of features of the base model, which allow one to assess the aptitude of the base model for a given transfer learning task. Finally, we observe that the multiclass model is more feature rich than its binary counterpart. The experimental evaluation is performed on the 2222 images from the 10k US faces dataset containing psychological attribute labels as well as on a subset of KDEF images.

本文着重解释使用深度神经网络解释脸部照片的吸引力，快乐，自信和智力等心理属性预测的问题。由于心理属性数据集通常受到小样本量的困扰，因此我们将转移学习应用于两个基本模型以避免过度拟合。这些模型分别接受年龄和性别预测任务的训练。使用一种新颖的解释方法，我们提取热点图，突出显示最负责预测的图像部分。我们进一步观察到，解释方法提供了对基本模型的特征的本质的重要认识，其允许人们评估给定转移学习任务的基础模型的适应性。最后，我们观察到，多类模型比二元模型更丰富。对包含心理属性标签的10k个美国人脸数据集以及KDEF图像的子集上的2222张图像进行实验评估。
