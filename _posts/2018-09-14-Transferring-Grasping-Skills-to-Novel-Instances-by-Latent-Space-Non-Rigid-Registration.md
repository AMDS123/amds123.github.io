##### Abstract
Robots acting in open environments need to be able to handle novel objects. Based on the observation that objects within a category are often similar in their shapes and usage, we propose an approach for transferring grasping skills from known instances to novel instances of an object category. Correspondences between the instances are established by means of a non-rigid registration method that combines the Coherent Point Drift approach with subspace methods. The known object instances are modeled using a canonical shape and a transformation which deforms it to match the instance shape. The principle axes of variation of these deformations define a low-dimensional latent space. New instances can be generated through interpolation and extrapolation in this shape space. For inferring the shape parameters of an unknown instance, an energy function expressed in terms of the latent variables is minimized. Due to the class-level knowledge of the object, our method is able to complete novel shapes from partial views. Control poses for generating grasping motions are transferred efficiently to novel instances by the estimated non-rigid transformation.

在开放环境中行动的机器人需要能够处理新的物体。基于观察到类别中的对象在形状和用途上经常相似，我们提出了一种将抓取技能从已知实例转移到对象类别的新实例的方法。通过将相干点漂移方法与子空间方法相结合的非刚性配准方法来建立实例之间的对应关系。使用规范形状和变形对已知对象实例建模，该变形使其变形以匹配实例形状。这些变形的主要变化轴定义了低维潜在空间。可以通过此形状空间中的插值和外推生成新实例。为了推断未知实例的形状参数，使用潜在变量表示的能量函数最小化。由于对象的类级知识，我们的方法能够从局部视图完成新颖的形状。通过估计的非刚性变换将用于产生抓取运动的控制姿势有效地转移到新的实例。
