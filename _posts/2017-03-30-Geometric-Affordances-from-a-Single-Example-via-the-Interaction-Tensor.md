##### Abstract
This paper develops and evaluates a new tensor field representation to express the geometric affordance of one object over another. We expand the well known bisector surface representation to one that is weight-driven and that retains the provenance of surface points with directional vectors. We also incorporate the notion of affordance keypoints which allow for faster decisions at a point of query and with a compact and straightforward descriptor. Using a single interaction example, we are able to generalize to previously-unseen scenarios; both synthetic and also real scenes captured with RGBD sensors. We show how our interaction tensor allows for significantly better performance over alternative formulations. Evaluations also include crowdsourcing comparisons that confirm the validity of our affordance proposals, which agree on average 84% of the time with human judgments, and which is 20-40% better than the baseline methods.

本文开发和评估了一个新的张量场表示法，以表示一个对象的几何可供性。我们将众所周知的二等分表面表示扩展为一个重量驱动的表面，并保留了具有方向向量的表面点的来源。我们还加入了可供选择的关键点的概念，这些关键点可以在查询点和一个简洁而直接的描述符中进行更快的决策。使用单个交互示例，我们能够推广到以前不可见的场景;用RGBD传感器拍摄的合成和真实场景。我们展示了我们的相互作用张量如何比替代配方显着提高性能。评估还包括众包比较，确认我们的可供件方案的有效性，平均84％的时间与人类判断一致，比基准方法好20-40％。
