##### Abstract
This article provides a brief introduction to the "Theory of Intelligence" and its realisation in the "SP Computer Model". The overall goal of the SP programme of research, in accordance with long-established principles in science, has been the simplification and integration of observations and concepts across artificial intelligence, mainstream computing, mathematics, and human learning, perception, and cognition. In broad terms, the SP system is a brain-like system that takes in "New" information through its senses and stores some or all of it as "Old" information. A central idea in the system is the powerful concept of "SP-multiple-alignment", borrowed and adapted from bioinformatics. This the key to the system's versatility in aspects of intelligence, in the representation of diverse kinds of knowledge, and in the seamless integration of diverse aspects of intelligence and diverse kinds of knowledge, in any combination. There are many potential benefits and applications of the SP system. It is envisaged that the system will be developed as the "SP Machine", which will initially be a software virtual machine, hosted on a high-performance computer, a vehicle for further research and a step towards the development of an industrial-strength SP Machine.

本文简要介绍了“智能理论”及其在“SP计算机模型”中的实现。根据长期确立的科学原理，SP研究计划的总体目标是简化和整合人工智能，主流计算，数学和人类学习，知觉和认知的观察和概念。广义而言，SP系统是一个类似大脑的系统，通过其感官接收“新”信息，并将其中一些或全部信息存储为“旧”信息。该系统的核心思想是“生物信息学”借鉴和改编的“SP多重比对”的强大概念。这是系统在智能，多种知识表示方面的多功能性的关键，也是智能和各种知识的各个方面无缝结合的关键。 SP系统有许多潜在的好处和应用。据设想，该系统将作为“SP机器”开发，该SP机器最初将成为一台软件虚拟机，托管在高性能计算机上，用于进一步研究的车辆和朝向开发工业级SP机。
