##### Abstract
Category, or property generalization is a central function in the human cognition. It plays a crucial role in a variety of domains, such as learning, everyday reasoning, specialized reasoning, and decision making. Judging the content of a dish as edible, a hormone level as healthy, a building as belonging to the same architectural style as previously seen buildings, are examples of category generalization. In this paper, we propose self-organizing maps as candidates to explain the psychological mechanisms underlying category generalization. Self-organizing maps are psychologically and biologically plausible neural network models that learn after limited exposure to positive category examples, without any need of contrastive information. Just like humans. They reproduce human behavior in category generalization, in particular for what concerns the well-known Numerosity and Variability effects, which are usually explained with Bayesian tools. Where category generalization is concerned, self-organizing maps are good candidates to bridge the gap between the computational level of analysis in Marr's hierarchy (where Bayesian models are situated) and the algorithmic level of aanalysis in Marr's hierarchy (where Bayesian models are situated) and the algorithmic level of analysis in which plausible mechanisms are described.

##### Abstract (translated by Google)
范畴或财产泛化是人类认知的核心功能。它在各种领域发挥着至关重要的作用，如学习，日常推理，专业推理和决策制定。将一道菜的内容视为可食用，将激素水平视为健康，将建筑物视为与以前看到的建筑物相同的建筑风格，就是类别概括的例子。在本文中，我们提出自组织地图作为解释范畴泛化的心理机制的候选人。自组织映射是在心理和生物学上似乎合理的神经网络模型，它们在有限范围内暴露于正面类别示例后学习，而不需要任何对比信息。就像人类一样。它们重现了类别概括中的人类行为，特别是涉及众所周知的数字和变异效应的问题，这些效应通常用贝叶斯工具解释。在涉及范畴泛化的情况下，自组织映射是弥补Marr层次结构（贝叶斯模型所处位置）的计算分析水平与Marr层次结构（贝叶斯模型所在的位置）的算法分析层次之间的差距的良好候选者，描述可信机制的分析算法层次。
