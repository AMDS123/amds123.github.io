##### Abstract
Segregation is a popular phenomenon. It has considerable effects on material performance. To the author's knowledge, there is still no automated objective quantitative indicator for segregation. In order to full fill this task, segregation of particles is analyzed. Edges of the particles are extracted from the digital picture. Then, the whole picture of particles is splintered to small rectangles with the same shape. Statistical index of the edges in each rectangle is calculated. Accordingly, segregation between the indexes corresponding to the rectangles is evaluated. The results show coincident with subjective evaluated results. Further more, it can be implemented as an automated system, which would facilitate the materials quality control mechanism during production process.

隔离是一种普遍现象。它对材料性能有相当大的影响。据笔者所知，目前还没有自动化的客观量化指标用于隔离。为了完成这个任务，分析颗粒的分离。从数字图片中提取粒子的边缘。然后，整个粒子的图像被分裂成相同形状的小矩形。计算每个矩形边缘的统计索引。因此，评估与矩形对应的指标之间的分离。结果显示与主观评估结果一致。进一步说，它可以作为一个自动化系统来实施，这将有利于生产过程中的材料质量控制机制。
