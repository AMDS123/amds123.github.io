##### Abstract
The central idea of this paper is to gain a deeper understanding of song lyrics computationally. We focus on two aspects: style and biases of song lyrics. All prior works to understand these two aspects are limited to manual analysis of a small corpus of song lyrics. In contrast, we analyzed more than half a million songs spread over five decades. We characterize the lyrics style in terms of vocabulary, length, repetitiveness, speed, and readability. We have observed that the style of popular songs significantly differs from other songs. We have used distributed representation methods and WEAT test to measure various gender and racial biases in the song lyrics. We have observed that biases in song lyrics correlate with prior results on human subjects. This correlation indicates that song lyrics reflect the biases that exist in society. Increasing consumption of music and the effect of lyrics on human emotions makes this analysis important.
