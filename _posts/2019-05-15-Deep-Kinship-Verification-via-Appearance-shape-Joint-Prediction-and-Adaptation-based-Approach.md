##### Abstract
Kinship verification aims to identify the kin relation between two given face images. It is a very challenging problem due to the lack of training data and facial similarity variations between kinship pairs. In this work, we build a novel appearance and shape based deep learning pipeline. First we adopt the knowledge learned from general face recognition network to learn general facial features. Afterwards, we learn kinship oriented appearance and shape features from kinship pairs and combine them for the final prediction. We have evaluated the model performance on a widely used popular benchmark and demonstrated the superiority over the state-of-the-art.
