##### Abstract
One of the most common critical factors directly related to the cause of a chronic disease is unhealthy diet consumption. In this sense, building an automatic system for food analysis could allow a better understanding of the nutritional information with respect to the food eaten and thus it could help in taking corrective actions in order to consume a better diet. The Computer Vision community has focused its efforts on several areas involved in the visual food analysis such as: food detection, food recognition, food localization, portion estimation, among others. For food detection, the best results evidenced in the state of the art were obtained using Convolutional Neural Network. However, the results of all these different approaches were gotten on different datasets and therefore are not directly comparable. This article proposes an overview of the last advances on food detection and an optimal model based on GoogLeNet Convolutional Neural Network method, principal component analysis, and a support vector machine that outperforms the state of the art on two public food/non-food datasets.

与慢性疾病的原因直接相关的最常见的关键因素之一是不健康的饮食消费。从这个意义上讲，构建食品分析自动化系统可以更好地了解所吃食物的营养信息，从而有助于采取纠正措施，从而消耗更多的食物。计算机视觉社区的工作重点放在视觉食品分析涉及的几个领域，如食品检测，食品识别，食品定位，部分估算等等。对于食物检测，使用卷积神经网络获得现有技术中证明的最好结果。然而，所有这些不同方法的结果都是在不同的数据集上得到的，因此不能直接比较。本文提出了食品检测最新进展的概述，以及基于GoogLeNet卷积神经网络方法，主成分分析和支持向量机的优化模型，其优于两种公共食品/非食品数据集的最新技术水平。
