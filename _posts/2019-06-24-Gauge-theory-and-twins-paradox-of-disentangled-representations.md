##### Abstract
Achieving disentangled representations of information is one of the key goals of deep network based machine learning system. Recently there are more discussions on this issue. In this paper, by comparing the geometric structure of disentangled representation and the geometry of the evolution of mixed states in quantum mechanics, we give a fibre bundle based geometric picture of disentangled representation which can be regarded as a kind of gauge theory. From this perspective we can build a connection between the disentangled representations and the twins paradox in relativity. This can help to clarify some problems about disentangled representation.
