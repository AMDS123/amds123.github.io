##### Abstract
Electroluminescence (EL) imaging is a powerful and established technique for assessing the quality of photovoltaic (PV) modules, which consist of many electrically connected solar cells arranged in a grid. The analysis of imperfect real-world images requires reliable methods for preprocessing, detection and extraction of the cells. We propose several methods for those tasks, which, however, can be modified to related imaging problems where similar geometric objects need to be detected accurately. Allowing for images taken under difficult outdoor conditions, we present methods to correct for rotation and perspective distortions. The next important step is the extraction of the solar cells of a PV module, for instance to pass them to a procedure to detect and analyze defects on their surface. We propose a method based on specialized Hough transforms, which allows to extract the cells even when the module is surrounded by disturbing background and a fast method based on cumulated sums (CUSUM) change detection to extract the cell area of single-cell mini-module, where the correction of perspective distortion is implicitly done. The methods are highly automatized to allow for big data analyses. Their application to a large database of EL images substantiates that the methods work reliably on a large scale for real-world images. Simulations show that the approach achieves high accuracy, reliability and robustness. This even holds for low contrast images as evaluated by comparing the simulated accuracy for a low and a high contrast image.

电致发光（EL）成像是用于评估光伏（PV）模块质量的强大且成熟的技术，其由布置在网格中的许多电连接的太阳能电池组成。对不完美的真实世界图像的分析需要可靠的方法来预处理，检测和提取细胞。我们为这些任务提出了几种方法，然而，这些方法可以修改为需要准确检测相似几何对象的相关成像问题。考虑到在困难的室外条件下拍摄的图像，我们提出了校正旋转和透视扭曲的方法。下一个重要步骤是提取PV模块的太阳能电池，例如将它们传递给检测和分析其表面缺陷的程序。我们提出了一种基于专门Hough变换的方法，即使模块被干扰背景包围也可以提取细胞，并且基于累积和（CUSUM）变化检测的快速方法可以提取单细胞小模块的细胞区域。 ，隐含地完成透视失真的校正。这些方法高度自动化，可以进行大数据分析。它们在大型EL图像数据库中的应用证实了这些方法可以大规模地可靠地用于真实世界的图像。仿真表明，该方法实现了高精度，可靠性和鲁棒性。这通过比较低对比度图像和高对比度图像的模拟精度来评估低对比度图像。
