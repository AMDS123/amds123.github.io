##### Abstract
In recent years there has been significant improvement in the capability of Visual Place Recognition (VPR) methods, building on the success of both hand-crafted and learnt visual features, temporal filtering and usage of semantic scene information. The wide range of approaches and the relatively recent growth in interest in the field has meant that a wide range of datasets and assessment methodologies have been proposed, often with a focus only on precision-recall type metrics, making comparison difficult. In this paper we present a comprehensive approach to evaluating the performance of 10 state-of-the-art recently-developed VPR techniques, which utilizes three standardized metrics: (a) Matching Performance b) Matching Time c) Memory Footprint. Together this analysis provides an up-to-date and widely encompassing snapshot of the various strengths and weaknesses of contemporary approaches to the VPR problem. The aim of this work is to help move this particular research field towards a more mature and unified approach to the problem, enabling better comparison and hence more progress to be made in future research.
