##### Abstract
In Japanese scientific news articles, although the research results are described clearly, the article's sources tend to be uncited. This makes it difficult for readers to know the details of the research. In this paper, we address the task of extracting journal names from Japanese scientific news articles. We hypothesize that a journal name is likely to occur in a specific context. To support the hypothesis, we construct a character-based method and extract journal names using this method. This method only uses the left and right context features of journal names. The results of the journal name extractions suggest that the distribution hypothesis plays an important role in identifying the journal names.
