##### Abstract
In this article, we present a rule-based approach for transliterating two mostly used orthographies in Sorani Kurdish. Our work consists of detecting a character in a word by removing the possible ambiguities and mapping it into the target orthography. We describe different challenges in Kurdish text mining and propose novel ideas concerning the transliteration task for Sorani Kurdish. Our transliteration system, named Wergor, achieves 82.79% overall precision and more than 99% in detecting the double-usage characters. We also present a manually transliterated corpus for Kurdish.
