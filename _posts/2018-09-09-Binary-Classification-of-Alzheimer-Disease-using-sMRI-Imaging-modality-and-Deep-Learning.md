##### Abstract
Alzheimer Disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia affecting the elderly population worldwide. Many neuroimaging modalities have been used to check the detection and progression of AD of which structural Magnetic Resonance Imaging (sMRI) is an important one. The recent rise in the popularity of deep learning methods with applications in computer vision, reinforcement learning and artificial intelligence has created a resurgence in the application of these methods to the classification of AD through different imaging modalities. In this study, by utilizing the concept of transfer learning in deep learning, we propose a classification framework to differentiate subjects with Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) of zero from subjects with CDR greater than zero by using deep learning architectures such as Xception and Inception version 3 in the Keras deep learning library. The attained validation set accuracies are as high as 99.12% for the Inception version 3 network and 97.97% for the Xception network. The presented results suggest that meaningful predictors composed of sMRI and network measures may offer the possibility for early detection of subjects in the early stages of AD.

阿尔茨海默病（AD）是影响全世界老年人群的最常见的痴呆症。已经使用许多神经成像模式来检查AD的检测和进展，其中结构磁共振成像（sMRI）是重要的。近来，深度学习方法在计算机视觉，强化学习和人工智能中的应用越来越普及，这些方法在通过不同成像模式对AD分类中的应用中重新抬头。在本研究中，通过利用深度学习中转移学习的概念，我们提出了一个分类框架，通过使用深度学习架构（如Xception和Inception版本）来区分CDR大于零的受试者的临床痴呆评分（CDR）为零的受试者3在Keras深度学习库中。获得的验证集精度对于Inception版本3网络高达99.12％，对于Xception网络高达97.97％。所呈现的结果表明，由sMRI和网络测量组成的有意义的预测因子可以提供在AD早期阶段早期检测受试者的可能性。
