##### Abstract
Videos contain very rich semantic information. Traditional hand-crafted features are known to be inadequate in analyzing complex video semantics. Inspired by the huge success of the deep learning methods in analyzing image, audio and text data, significant efforts are recently being devoted to the design of deep nets for video analytics. Among the many practical needs, classifying videos (or video clips) based on their major semantic categories (e.g., "skiing") is useful in many applications. In this paper, we conduct an in-depth study to investigate important implementation options that may affect the performance of deep nets on video classification. Our evaluations are conducted on top of a recent two-stream convolutional neural network (CNN) pipeline, which uses both static frames and motion optical flows, and has demonstrated competitive performance against the state-of-the-art methods. In order to gain insights and to arrive at a practical guideline, many important options are studied, including network architectures, model fusion, learning parameters and the final prediction methods. Based on the evaluations, very competitive results are attained on two popular video classification benchmarks. We hope that the discussions and conclusions from this work can help researchers in related fields to quickly set up a good basis for further investigations along this very promising direction.

视频包含非常丰富的语义信息。传统的手工功能在分析复杂的视频语义方面已知是不够的。受深度学习方法在图像，音频和文本数据分析方面的巨大成功的启发，最近正在致力于视频分析深网的设计。在许多实际需求中，基于其主要语义类别（例如“滑雪”）对视频（或视频剪辑）进行分类在许多应用中是有用的。在本文中，我们进行深入研究，以调查可能影响深度网络视频分类性能的重要实施选项。我们的评估是在最近使用静态帧和运动光学流的双流卷积神经网络（CNN）流水线上进行的，并且已经证明了与最先进的方法相比的竞争性能。为了获得见解并得出一个实用指南，研究了许多重要的选项，包括网络架构，模型融合，学习参数和最终预测方法。基于评估，在两个流行的视频分类基准上获得了非常有竞争力的结果。我们希望这项工作的讨论和结论可以帮助相关领域的研究人员迅速为这个非常有希望的方向进一步调查奠定良好的基础。
