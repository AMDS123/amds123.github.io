##### Abstract
Indoor localization is one of the crucial enablers for deployment of service robots. Although several successful techniques for indoor localization have been proposed in the past, the majority of them relies on maps generated based on data gathered with the same sensor modality that is used for localization. Typically, tedious labor by experts is needed to acquire this data, thus limiting the readiness of the system as well as its ease of installation for inexperienced operators. In this paper, we propose a memory and computationally efficient monocular camera-based localization system that allows a robot to estimate its pose given an architectural floor plan. Our method employs a convolutional neural network to predict room layout edges from a single camera image and estimates the robot pose using a particle filter that matches the extracted edges to the given floor plan. We evaluate our localization system with multiple real-world experiments and demonstrate that it has the robustness and accuracy required for reliable indoor navigation.
