##### Abstract
We consider incorporating topic information into message-response matching to boost responses with rich content in retrieval-based chatbots. To this end, we propose a topic-aware convolutional neural tensor network (TACNTN). In TACNTN, matching between a message and a response is not only conducted between a message vector and a response vector generated by convolutional neural networks, but also leverages extra topic information encoded in two topic vectors. The two topic vectors are linear combinations of topic words of the message and the response respectively, where the topic words are obtained from a pre-trained LDA model and their weights are determined by themselves as well as the message vector and the response vector. The message vector, the response vector, and the two topic vectors are fed to neural tensors to calculate a matching score. Empirical study on a public data set and a human annotated data set shows that TACNTN can significantly outperform state-of-the-art methods for message-response matching.

我们考虑将主题信息合并到消息响应匹配中，以提高基于检索的聊天机器人中丰富内容的响应。为此，我们提出了一个主题感知卷积神经张量网络（TACNTN）。在TACNTN中，消息和响应之间的匹配不仅在消息向量和卷积神经网络产生的响应向量之间进行，而且还利用在两个主题向量中编码的额外主题信息。两个主题向量分别是消息的主题词和响应的线性组合，其中主题词从预先训练的LDA模型获得，并且它们的权重由它们自己以及消息向量和响应向量来确定。消息向量，响应向量和两个主题向量被馈送到神经张量以计算匹配分数。公共数据集和人类注释数据集的实证研究表明，TACNTN可以显着优于最先进的消息响应匹配方法。
