##### Abstract
Change detection is one of the most challenging issues when analyzing remotely sensed images. Comparing several multi-date images acquired through the same kind of sensor is the most common scenario. Conversely, designing robust, flexible and scalable algorithms for change detection becomes even more challenging when the images have been acquired by two different kinds of sensors. This situation arises in case of emergency under critical constraints. This paper presents, to the best of authors' knowledge, the first strategy to deal with optical images characterized by dissimilar spatial and spectral resolutions. Typical considered scenarios include change detection between panchromatic or multispectral and hyperspectral images. The proposed strategy consists of a 3-step procedure: i) inferring a high spatial and spectral resolution image by fusion of the two observed images characterized one by a low spatial resolution and the other by a low spectral resolution, ii) predicting two images with respectively the same spatial and spectral resolutions as the observed images by degradation of the fused one and iii) implementing a decision rule to each pair of observed and predicted images characterized by the same spatial and spectral resolutions to identify changes. The performance of the proposed framework is evaluated on real images with simulated realistic changes.

在分析遥感图像时，变化检测是最具挑战性的问题之一。比较通过相同类型的传感器获取的多个多日期图像是最常见的情况。相反，当图像被两种不同类型的传感器采集时，设计用于变化检测的鲁棒性，灵活性和可扩展性算法变得更具挑战性。在紧急情况下出现这种情况。根据作者所知，本文提出了处理具有不同空间和光谱分辨率的光学图像的第一种策略。典型的被考虑的情况包括全色或多光谱与高光谱图像之间的变化检测。所提出的策略包括三个步骤：i）通过融合两个观察到的图像来推断高空间和光谱分辨率图像，其中一个由低空间分辨率表征，另一个由低光谱分辨率表征，ii）用分别具有与通过融合图像的退化所观察到的图像相同的空间和光谱分辨率，以及iii）对由相同空间和光谱分辨率表征的每一对观察和预测图像实施判定规则以识别变化。所提出的框架的性能在真实图像上通过模拟的实际变化进行评估。
