##### Abstract
A new visual navigation based on visual teach and repeat technique is described in this paper. In this kind of navigation, a robot is controlled to follow a path while it is recording a video. Some keyframes are extracted from the video. The extracted keyframes are called visual path and the interval between each two keyframes is called a segment. Later, the robot uses these keyframes to navigate autonomously to follow the desired path. Funnel lane is a recent method to follow visual paths which was proposed by Chen and Birchfield. The method requires a single camera with no calibration or any further calculations such as Jacobian, homography or fundamental matrix. A qualitative comparison between features coordinates is done to follow the visual path. Although experimental results on ground and flying robots show the effectiveness of this method, the method has some limitations. It cannot deal with all types of turning conditions such as rotations in place. Another limitation is an ambiguity between translation and rotation which in some cases may cause the robot to deviate from the desired path. In this paper, we introduce the sloped funnel lane and we explain how it can overcome these limitations. In addition, some challenging scenarios were conducted on a real ground robot to show that. Also, the accuracy and the repeatability of both methods were compared in two different paths. The results show that sloped funnel lane is superior.

本文介绍了一种基于视觉教学和重复技术的视觉导航。在这种导航中，控制机器人在录制视频时遵循路径。从视频中提取一些关键帧。提取的关键帧称为视觉路径，每两个关键帧之间的间隔称为段。之后，机器人使用这些关键帧自主导航以遵循所需的路径。 Funnel lane是最近采用Chen和Birchfield提出的视觉路径的方法。该方法需要单个摄像机，不需要校准或任何进一步的计算，如雅可比，单应性或基本矩阵。在特征坐标之间进行定性比较以遵循视觉路径。虽然地面和飞行机器人的实验结果显示了该方法的有效性，但该方法存在一些局限性。它不能处理所有类型的转弯条件，例如轮换。另一个限制是平移和旋转之间的模糊，在某些情况下可能导致机器人偏离期望的路径。在本文中，我们介绍了倾斜的漏斗通道，并解释了它如何克服这些限制。此外，在真实的地面机器人上进行了一些具有挑战性的场景来展示这一点。此外，两种方法的准确性和可重复性在两个不同的路径中进行了比较。结果表明，倾斜的漏斗道优越。
