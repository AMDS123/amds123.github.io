##### Abstract
Dealing with memory and time constraints are current challenges when learning from data streams with a massive amount of data. Many algorithms have been proposed to handle these difficulties, among them, the Very Fast Decision Tree (VFDT) algorithm. Although the VFDT has been widely used in data stream mining, in the last years, several authors have suggested modifications to increase its performance, putting aside memory concerns by proposing memory-costly solutions. Besides, most data stream mining solutions have been centred around ensembles, which combine the memory costs of their weak learners, usually VFDTs. To reduce the memory cost, keeping the predictive performance, this study proposes the Strict VFDT (SVFDT), a novel algorithm based on the VFDT. The SVFDT algorithm minimises unnecessary tree growth, substantially reducing memory usage and keeping competitive predictive performance. Moreover, since it creates much more shallow trees than VFDT, SVFDT can achieve a shorter processing time. Experiments were carried out comparing the SVFDT with the VFDT in 11 benchmark data stream datasets. This comparison assessed the trade-off between accuracy, memory, and processing time. Statistical analysis showed that the proposed algorithm obtained similar predictive performance and significantly reduced processing time and memory use. Thus, SVFDT is a suitable option for data stream mining with memory and time limitations, recommended as a weak learner in ensemble-based solutions.

在处理大量数据的数据流时，处理内存和时间限制是当前面临的挑战。已经提出了许多算法来处理这些困难，其中包括特快决策树（VFDT）算法。虽然VFDT已被广泛用于数据流挖掘，但在过去的几年中，一些作者建议进行修改以提高其性能，并提出内存昂贵的解决方案来抛开内存问题。此外，大多数数据流挖掘解决方案都以集成为中心，它们结合了弱学习者（通常是VFDT）的内存成本。为了降低存储器成本，保持预测性能，本研究提出了基于VFDT的新算法 - 严格VFDT（SVFDT）。 SVFDT算法最大限度地减少了不必要的树增长，大大减少了内存使用量并保持了竞争性预测性能。此外，由于它创建的树比VFDT多得多，SVFDT可以缩短处理时间。在11个基准数据流数据集中进行了将SVFDT与VFDT进行比较的实验。这种比较评估了精度，内存和处理时间之间的折衷。统计分析表明，该算法获得了相似的预测性能，并显着减少了处理时间和内存使用。因此，SVFDT是适合存储和时间限制的数据流挖掘选项，被推荐为基于集合解决方案的弱学习者。
