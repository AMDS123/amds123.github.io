##### Abstract
The increasing prevalence of diet-related chronic diseases coupled with the ineffectiveness of traditional diet management methods have resulted in a need for novel tools to accurately and automatically assess meals. Recently, computer vision based systems that use meal images to assess their content have been proposed. Food portion estimation is the most difficult task for individuals assessing their meals and it is also the least studied area. The present paper proposes a three-stage system to calculate portion sizes using two images of a dish acquired by mobile devices. The first stage consists in understanding the configuration of the different views, after which a dense 3D model is built from the two images; finally, this 3D model serves to extract the volume of the different items. The system was extensively tested on 77 real dishes of known volume, and achieved an average error of less than 10% in 5.5 seconds per dish. The proposed pipeline is computationally tractable and requires no user input, making it a viable option for fully automated dietary assessment.

与饮食有关的慢性疾病日益普遍，加上传统的饮食管理方法无效，导致需要新颖的工具来准确地自动评估膳食。近来，已经提出了使用膳食图像来评估其内容的基于计算机视觉的系统。估计食物部分是评估个人膳食的最困难的任务，也是研究最少的领域。本文提出了一个三阶段系统来计算部分大小使用两个移动设备获得的碟子的图像。第一阶段是理解不同视图的配置，然后从这两个图像构建一个密集的三维模型;最后，这个3D模型用于提取不同项目的音量。该系统在已知体积的77个实际盘子上进行了广泛测试，并且在每盘5.5秒内达到小于10％的平均误差。拟议的管道计算易于处理，不需要用户输入，使其成为全自动膳食评估的可行选择。
