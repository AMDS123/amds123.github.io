##### Abstract
Topic discovery has witnessed a significant growth as a field of data mining at large. In particular, time-evolving topic discovery, where the evolution of a topic is taken into account has been instrumental in understanding the historical context of an emerging topic in a dynamic corpus. Traditionally, time-evolving topic discovery has focused on this notion of time. However, especially in settings where content is contributed by a community or a crowd, an orthogonal notion of time is the one that pertains to the level of expertise of the content creator: the more experienced the creator, the more advanced the topic. In this paper, we propose a novel time-evolving topic discovery method which, in addition to the extracted topics, is able to identify the evolution of that topic over time, as well as the level of difficulty of that topic, as it is inferred by the level of expertise of its main contributors. Our method is based on a novel formulation of Constrained Coupled Matrix-Tensor Factorization, which adopts constraints well-motivated for, and, as we demonstrate, are essential for high-quality topic discovery. We qualitatively evaluate our approach using real data from the Physics and also Programming Stack Exchange forum, and we were able to identify topics of varying levels of difficulty which can be linked to external events, such as the announcement of gravitational waves by the LIGO lab in Physics forum. We provide a quantitative evaluation of our method by conducting a user study where experts were asked to judge the coherence and quality of the extracted topics. Finally, our proposed method has implications for automatic curriculum design using the extracted topics, where the notion of the level of difficulty is necessary for the proper modeling of prerequisites and advanced concepts.

作为一个数据挖掘领域，主题发现已经见证了显着增长。特别是，时间发展的主题发现，其中主题的演变被考虑在内，有助于理解动态语料库中新兴主题的历史背景。传统上，时间发展的主题发现集中在这个时间概念上。然而，特别是在内容由社区或人群贡献的环境中，正交的时间概念是与内容创建者的专业水平相关的概念：创建者越有经验，主题越高级。在本文中，我们提出了一种新颖的时间演化主题发现方法，除了提取的主题之外，它还能够识别该主题随时间的演变，以及该主题的难易程度，因为它是推断的。根据其主要贡献者的专业水平。我们的方法基于一种新的约束耦合矩阵 - 张量分解的公式，它采用了很好的约束条件，并且正如我们所证明的那样，对于高质量的主题发现至关重要。我们使用物理学和编程堆栈交换论坛的实际数据定性评估我们的方法，我们能够识别可能与外部事件相关的不同难度级别的主题，例如LIGO实验室发布的引力波。物理论坛。我们通过进行用户研究来对我们的方法进行定量评估，要求专家判断所提取主题的一致性和质量。最后，我们提出的方法对使用提取的主题的自动课程设计有影响，其中难度级别的概念对于先决条件和高级概念的正确建模是必要的。
