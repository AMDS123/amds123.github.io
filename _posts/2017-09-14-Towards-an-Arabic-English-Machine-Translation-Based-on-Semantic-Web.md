##### Abstract
Communication tools make the world like a small village and as a consequence people can contact with others who are from different societies or who speak different languages. This communication cannot happen effectively without Machine Translation because they can be found anytime and everywhere. There are a number of studies that have developed Machine Translation for the English language with so many other languages except the Arabic it has not been considered yet. Therefore we aim to highlight a roadmap for our proposed translation machine to provide an enhanced Arabic English translation based on Semantic.

交流工具使世界像一个小村庄，因此人们可以与来自不同社会或讲不同语言的人联系。没有机器翻译，这种沟通不可能有效地发生，因为它们可以随时随地找到。有许多研究已经发展了英语的机器翻译与许多其他语言，除了阿拉伯语尚未考虑。因此，我们的目标是突出我们提出的翻译机的路线图，以提供基于语义的增强的阿拉伯语英语翻译。
