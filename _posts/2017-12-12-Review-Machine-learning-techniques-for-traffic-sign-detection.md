##### Abstract
An automatic road sign detection system localizes road signs from within images captured by an on-board camera of a vehicle, and support the driver to properly ride the vehicle. Most existing algorithms include a preprocessing step, feature extraction and detection step. This paper arranges the methods applied to road sign detection into two groups: general machine learning, neural networks. In this review, the issues related to automatic road sign detection are addressed, the popular existing methods developed to tackle the road sign detection problem are reviewed, and a comparison of the features of these methods is composed.

##### Abstract (translated by Google)
自动道路标志检测系统对来自车辆的车载摄像头拍摄的图像内的道路标志进行定位，并且支持驾驶员正确地驾驶车辆。大多数现有的算法包括预处理步骤，特征提取和检测步骤。本文将用于道路标志检测的方法分为两类：一般机器学习，神经网络。本文综述了有关自动道路标志检测的相关问题，重点介绍了目前为解决道路标志检测问题而开发的现有方法，并对这些方法的特点进行了比较。
