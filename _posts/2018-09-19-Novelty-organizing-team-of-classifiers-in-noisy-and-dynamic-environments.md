##### Abstract
In the real world, the environment is constantly changing with the input variables under the effect of noise. However, few algorithms were shown to be able to work under those circumstances. Here, Novelty-Organizing Team of Classifiers (NOTC) is applied to the continuous action mountain car as well as two variations of it: a noisy mountain car and an unstable weather mountain car. These problems take respectively noise and change of problem dynamics into account. Moreover, NOTC is compared with NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies (NEAT) in these problems, revealing a trade-off between the approaches. While NOTC achieves the best performance in all of the problems, NEAT needs less trials to converge. It is demonstrated that NOTC achieves better performance because of its division of the input space (creating easier problems). Unfortunately, this division of input space also requires a bit of time to bootstrap.

在现实世界中，环境随着输入变量在噪声的影响下不断变化。但是，很少有算法能够在这种情况下工作。在这里，新奇组织团队（NOTC）被应用于连续行动山地车以及它的两个变体：嘈杂的山地车和不稳定的天气山地车。这些问题分别考虑了噪声和问题动态的变化。此外，NOTC与这些问题中的增强拓扑（NEAT）的NeuroEvolution进行了比较，揭示了这些方法之间的权衡。虽然NOTC在所有问题中都能达到最佳性能，但NEAT需要较少的试验才能收敛。证明了NOTC由于其输入空间的划分（创建更容易的问题）而实现了更好的性能。不幸的是，输入空间的这种划分也需要一些时间来引导。
