##### Abstract
We present the application of a low dimensional manifold model (LDMM) on hyperspectral image (HSI) reconstruction. An important property of hyperspectral images is that the patch manifold, which is sampled by the three-dimensional blocks in the data cube, is generally of a low dimensional nature. This is a generalization of low-rank models in that hyperspectral images with nonlinear mixing terms can also fit in this framework. The point integral method (PIM) is used to solve a Laplace-Beltrami equation over a point cloud sampling the patch manifold in LDMM. Both numerical simulations and theoretical analysis show that the sample points constraint is correctly enforced by PIM. The framework is demonstrated by experiments on the reconstruction of both linear and nonlinear mixed hyperspectral images with a significant number of missing voxels and several entirely missing spectral bands.

我们提出了低维流形模型（LDMM）在高光谱图像（HSI）重建中的应用。高光谱图像的一个重要特性是，由数据立方体中的三维块采样的贴片流形通常具有低维性质。这是低阶模型的推广，因为具有非线性混合项的高光谱图像也可以适用于这个框架。点积分法（PIM）用于求解LDMM中斑点流​​形的点云上的Laplace-Beltrami方程。数值模拟和理论分析都表明，采样点约束由PIM正确执行。该框架通过重建线性和非线性混合高光谱图像的实验来证明，其中有大量缺失体素和几个完全缺失的光谱带。
