##### Abstract
With the constant growth of the World Wide Web and the number of documents in different languages accordingly, the need for reliable language detection tools has increased as well. Platforms such as Twitter with predominantly short texts are becoming important information resources, which additionally imposes the need for short texts language detection algorithms. In this paper, we show how incorporating personalized user-specific information into the language detection algorithm leads to an important improvement of detection results. To choose the best algorithm for language detection for short text messages, we investigate several machine learning approaches. These approaches include the use of the well-known classifiers such as SVM and logistic regression, a dictionary based approach, and a probabilistic model based on modified Kneser-Ney smoothing. Furthermore, the extension of the probabilistic model to include additional user-specific information such as evidence accumulation per user and user interface language is explored, with the goal of improving the classification performance. The proposed approaches are evaluated on randomly collected Twitter data containing Latin as well as non-Latin alphabet languages and the quality of the obtained results is compared, followed by the selection of the best performing algorithm. This algorithm is then evaluated against two already existing general language detection tools: Chromium Compact Language Detector 2 (CLD2) and langid, where our method significantly outperforms the results achieved by both of the mentioned methods. Additionally, a preview of benefits and possible applications of having a reliable language detection algorithm is given.

随着万维网的不断增长以及不同语言的文档数量的增加，对可靠的语言检测工具的需求也随之增加。诸如Twitter之类的平台主要以短文本形式成为重要的信息资源，这另外需要短文本语言检测算法。在本文中，我们展示了如何将个性化的用户特定信息结合到语言检测算法中，导致检测结果的重要改进。为了选择最佳的短文本语言检测算法，我们研究了几种机器学习方法。这些方法包括使用众所周知的分类器，如支持向量机和逻辑回归，基于字典的方法，以及基于修正Kneser-Ney平滑的概率模型。此外，还探讨了概率模型的扩展，包括额外的用户特定信息，如每个用户的证据累积和用户界面语言，以提高分类性能为目标。所提出的方法是对随机收集的包含拉丁语以及非拉丁语字母语言的Twitter数据进行评估，并比较获得的结果的质量，然后选择性能最佳的算法。然后，针对两种现有的通用语言检测工具（Chromium Compact Language Detector 2（CLD2）和langid）评估该算法，其中我们的方法明显优于上述两种方法所获得的结果。此外，给出了一个可靠的语言检测算法的好处和可能的应用预览。
