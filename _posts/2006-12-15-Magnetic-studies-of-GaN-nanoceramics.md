##### Abstract
The synthesis, morphology and magnetization measurements of GaN nanoceramics obtained under high pressure are reported. In particular the effect of grain size on magnetic properties of GaN nanopowders and nanoceramics was investigated. It was found that for the GaN nanoceramic characterized by the stronger deformation of nanocrystalline grains the diamagnetic signal changes with external magnetic field similarly to the Meissner effect in superconductors.
