##### Abstract
The growing use of control access systems based on face recognition shed light over the need for even more accurate systems to detect face spoofing attacks. In this paper, an extensive analysis on face spoofing detection works published in the last decade is presented. The analyzed works are categorized by their fundamental parts, i.e., descriptors and classifiers. This structured survey also brings the temporal evolution of the face spoofing detection field, as well as a comparative analysis of the works considering the most important public data sets in the field. The methodology followed in this work is particularly relevant to observe trends in the existing approaches, to discuss still opened issues, and to propose new perspectives for the future of face spoofing detection.

基于人脸识别的控制访问系统的使用越来越多，因此需要更精确的系统来检测人脸欺骗攻击。本文介绍了近十年来发表的关于人脸欺骗检测工作的广泛分析。所分析的作品按其基本部分进行分类，即描述符和分类器。这个结构化的调查也带来了人脸欺骗检测领域的时间演变，并且考虑到了该领域最重要的公共数据集的作品的比较分析。本文所采用的方法尤其适用于观察现有方法的趋势，讨论尚未解决的问题，并为面部欺骗检测的未来提出新的观点。
