##### Abstract
In this article, we study laughter found in child-robot interaction where it had not been prompted intentionally. Different types of laughter and speech-laugh are annotated and processed. In a descriptive part, we report on the position of laughter and speech-laugh in syntax and dialogue structure, and on communicative functions. In a second part, we report on automatic classification performance and on acoustic characteristics, based on extensive feature selection procedures.
