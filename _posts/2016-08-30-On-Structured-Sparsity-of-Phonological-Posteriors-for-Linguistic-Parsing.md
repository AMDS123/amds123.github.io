##### Abstract
The speech signal conveys information on different time scales from short time scale or segmental, associated to phonological and phonetic information to long time scale or supra segmental, associated to syllabic and prosodic information. Linguistic and neurocognitive studies recognize the phonological classes at segmental level as the essential and invariant representations used in speech temporal organization. In the context of speech processing, a deep neural network (DNN) is an effective computational method to infer the probability of individual phonological classes from a short segment of speech signal. A vector of all phonological class probabilities is referred to as phonological posterior. There are only very few classes comprising a short term speech signal; hence, the phonological posterior is a sparse vector. Although the phonological posteriors are estimated at segmental level, we claim that they convey supra-segmental information. Specifically, we demonstrate that phonological posteriors are indicative of syllabic and prosodic events. Building on findings from converging linguistic evidence on the gestural model of Articulatory Phonology as well as the neural basis of speech perception, we hypothesize that phonological posteriors convey properties of linguistic classes at multiple time scales, and this information is embedded in their support (index) of active coefficients. To verify this hypothesis, we obtain a binary representation of phonological posteriors at the segmental level which is referred to as first-order sparsity structure; the high-order structures are obtained by the concatenation of first-order binary vectors. It is then confirmed that the classification of supra-segmental linguistic events, the problem known as linguistic parsing, can be achieved with high accuracy using asimple binary pattern matching of first-order or high-order structures.

语音信号将不同时间尺度上的信息从短时间尺度或节段传达，与语音和语音信息相关联的长时间尺度或超段，与音节和韵律信息相关联。语言学和神经认知研究认识到语言层面上的语音类是语言时态组织中必不可少的和不变的表征。在语音处理的背景下，深度神经网络（DNN）是一种有效的计算方法，可以从短语段的语音信号中推断出单个语音类别的概率。所有音系类概率的矢量被称为语音后验。短期语音信号只有极少数类别，因此，音韵后缀是一个稀疏矢量。虽然音韵学后人是在分段水平上估计的，但我们声称他们传达了超音段信息。具体而言，我们表明，音韵学的后代是音节和韵律事件的指示。我们假设语音学后现代在多个时间尺度上传达了语言类的属性，并将这些信息嵌入到它们的支持（索引）中，的有效系数。为了验证这个假设，我们得到了在分段水平上的音系后验的二元表示，这被称为一阶稀疏结构;高阶结构是通过一阶二元向量的串联而获得的。然后证实了超段语言事件的分类，称为语言分析的问题，可以使用一阶或高阶结构的简单二进制模式匹配来高精度地实现。
