##### Abstract
Honey bees use optical flow to avoid obstacles effectively. In this research work similar methodology was tested on a simulated mobile robot. Simulation framework was based on VRML and Simulink in a 3D world. Optical flow vectors were calculated from a video scene captured by a virtual camera which was used as inputs to a fuzzy logic controller. Fuzzy logic controller decided the locomotion of the robot. Different fuzzy logic rules were evaluated. The robot was able to navigate through complex static and dynamic environments effectively, avoiding obstacles on its path.
