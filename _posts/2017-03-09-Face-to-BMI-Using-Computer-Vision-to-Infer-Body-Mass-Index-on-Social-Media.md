##### Abstract
A person's weight status can have profound implications on their life, ranging from mental health, to longevity, to financial income. At the societal level, "fat shaming" and other forms of "sizeism" are a growing concern, while increasing obesity rates are linked to ever raising healthcare costs. For these reasons, researchers from a variety of backgrounds are interested in studying obesity from all angles. To obtain data, traditionally, a person would have to accurately self-report their body-mass index (BMI) or would have to see a doctor to have it measured. In this paper, we show how computer vision can be used to infer a person's BMI from social media images. We hope that our tool, which we release, helps to advance the study of social aspects related to body weight.

##### Abstract (translated by Google)
一个人的体重状况会对他们的生活产生深远的影响，从精神健康到长寿，再到财务收入。在社会层面上，“胖胖”和其他形式的“大小”是一个越来越令人担忧的问题，而肥胖率的上升与医疗成本的不断上升息息相关。由于这些原因，来自不同背景的研究人员都有兴趣从各个角度研究肥胖症。为了获得数据，传统上，一个人必须准确地自我报告他们的身体质量指数（BMI），或者必须去看医生进行测量。在本文中，我们展示了如何使用计算机视觉从社交媒体图像推断一个人的BMI。我们希望我们发布的这个工具有助于推动与体重有关的社会方面的研究。
