##### Abstract
Exciton fine structures in cubic III-V semiconductor GaAs, InAs and GaN quantum dots are investigated systematically and the exciton spin relaxation in GaN quantum dots is calculated by first setting up the effective exciton Hamiltonian. The electron-hole exchange interaction Hamiltonian, which consists of the long- and short-range parts, is derived within the effective-mass approximation by taking into account the conduction, heavy- and light-hole bands, and especially the split-off band. The scheme applied in this work allows the description of excitons in both the strong and weak confinement regimes. The importance of treating the direct electron-hole Coulomb interaction unperturbatively is demonstrated. We show in our calculation that the light-hole and split-off bands are negligible when considering the exciton fine structure, even for GaN quantum dots, and the short-range exchange interaction is irrelevant when considering the optically active doublet splitting. We point out that the long-range exchange interaction, which is neglected in many previous works, contributes to the energy splitting between the bright and dark states, together with the short-range exchange interaction. Strong dependence of the optically active doublet splitting on the anisotropy of dot shape is reported. Large doublet splittings up to 600 $\mu$eV, and even up to several meV for small dot size with large anisotropy, is shown in GaN quantum dots. The spin relaxation between the lowest two optically active exciton states in GaN quantum dots is calculated, showing a strong dependence on the dot anisotropy. Long exciton spin relaxation time is reported in GaN quantum dots. These findings are in good agreement with the experimental results.

本文系统地研究了立方III-V族半导体GaAs，InAs和GaN量子点中的激子精细结构，首次设置了有效激子哈密顿量，计算了GaN量子点中的激子自旋弛豫。由有效质量近似推导出由长，短距离部分组成的电子 - 空穴交换相互作用哈密顿量，考虑到传导，重和轻空穴带，尤其是分裂带。在这项工作中应用的方案允许描述在强和弱的禁闭状态下的激子。证明了直接电子空穴库仑相互作用的非微扰的重要性。在我们的计算中，我们的计算表明，考虑到激子精细结构，即使对于GaN量子点，光洞和分裂带也是可以忽略的，并且当考虑光学活性双合透镜分裂时，短程交换相互作用是不相关的。我们指出，以前许多作品忽略的远距离交换互动，有助于明朗与黑暗之间的能量分裂，以及短距离交换互动。报道了光学活性双重分裂对点形状各向异性的强烈依赖性。 GaN量子点显示出高达600 $ \ mu $ eV的双峰分裂，甚至高达几meV，对于具有大各向异性的小点尺寸。计算了GaN量子点中最低两个光学活性激子态之间的自旋弛豫，显示出对点各向异性的强烈依赖性。在GaN量子点中报道了长的激子自旋弛豫时间。这些发现与实验结果非常吻合。
