##### Abstract
In this study, a machine learning algorithm is used for disaggregation of SMAP brightness temperatures (T$_{\textrm{B}}$) from 36km to 9km. It uses image segmentation to cluster the study region based on meteorological and land cover similarity, followed by a support vector machine based regression that computes the value of the disaggregated T$_{\textrm{B}}$ at all pixels. High resolution remote sensing products such as land surface temperature, normalized difference vegetation index, enhanced vegetation index, precipitation, soil texture, and land-cover were used for disaggregation. The algorithm was implemented in Iowa, United States, from April to July 2015, and compared with the SMAP L3_SM_AP T$_{\textrm{B}}$ product at 9km. It was found that the disaggregated T$_{\textrm{B}}$ were very similar to the SMAP-T$_{\textrm{B}}$ product, even for vegetated areas with a mean difference $\leq$ 5K. However, the standard deviation of the disaggregation was lower by 7K than that of the AP product. The probability density functions of the disaggregated T$_{\textrm{B}}$ were similar to the SMAP-T$_{\textrm{B}}$. The results indicate that this algorithm may be used for disaggregating T$_{\textrm{B}}$ using complex non-linear correlations on a grid.

在这项研究中，机器学习算法用于从36km到9km分解SMAP亮度温度（T $ _ {textrm {B}} $）。它使用图像分割来根据气象和土地覆盖相似性对研究区域进行聚类，然后是基于支持向量机的回归计算所有像素处的分解T $ _ {textrm {B}} $的值。利用地表温度，归一化差异植被指数，植被指数增强，降水量，土壤质地，土地覆盖等高分辨率遥感产品进行分类。该算法于2015年4月至7月在美国爱荷华州实施，并与9km处的SMAP L3_SM_AP T $ _ {\ textrm {B}} $产品进行比较。据发现，分解的T $ _ {textrm {B}} $与SMAP-T $ _ {\ textrm {B}} $产品非常相似，即使对于平均差异为$ 5q $ 5K的植物区。然而，分解的标准偏差比AP产品低7K。分解T $ _ {textrm {B}} $的概率密度函数类似于SMAP-T $ _ {textrm {B}} $。结果表明，该算法可以用于在网格上使用复杂的非线性相关来分解T $ _ {\ textrm {B}} $。
