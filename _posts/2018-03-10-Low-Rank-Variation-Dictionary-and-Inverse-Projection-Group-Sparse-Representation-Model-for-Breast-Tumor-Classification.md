##### Abstract
Sparse representation classification achieves good results by addressing recognition problem with sufficient training samples per subject. However, SRC performs not very well for small sample data. In this paper, an inverse-projection group sparse representation model is presented for breast tumor classification, which is based on constructing low-rank variation dictionary. The proposed low-rank variation dictionary tackles tumor recognition problem from the viewpoint of detecting and using variations in gene expression profiles of normal and patients, rather than directly using these samples. The inverse projection group sparsity representation model is constructed based on taking full using of exist samples and group effect of microarray gene data. Extensive experiments on public breast tumor microarray gene expression datasets demonstrate the proposed technique is competitive with state-of-the-art methods. The results of Breast-1, Breast-2 and Breast-3 databases are 80.81%, 89.10% and 100% respectively, which are better than the latest literature.

稀疏表示分类通过针对每个主题的足够训练样本解决识别问题来实现良好结果。然而，SRC对小样本数据表现不佳。本文提出了一种基于构建低秩变异字典的乳腺肿瘤分类的反投影组稀疏表示模型。所提出的低秩变异字典从检测和使用正常和患者的基因表达谱变化的观点来处理肿瘤识别问题，而不是直接使用这些样品。在充分利用已有样本和微阵列基因数据的群体效应的基础上，构建反投影群稀疏表示模型。公共乳房肿瘤微阵列基因表达数据集的大量实验表明所提出的技术与最先进的方法相比具有竞争性。 Breast-1，Breast-2和Breast-3数据库的结果分别为80.81％，89.10％和100％，优于最新文献。
