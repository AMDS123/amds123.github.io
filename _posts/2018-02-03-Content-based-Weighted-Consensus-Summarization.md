##### Abstract
Multi-document summarization has received a great deal of attention in the past couple of decades. Several approaches have been proposed, many of which perform equally well and it is becoming in- creasingly difficult to choose one particular system over another. An ensemble of such systems that is able to leverage the strengths of each individual systems can build a better and more robust summary. Despite this, few attempts have been made in this direction. In this paper, we describe a category of ensemble systems which use consensus between the candidate systems to build a better meta-summary. We highlight two major shortcomings of such systems: the inability to take into account relative performance of individual systems and overlooking content of candidate summaries in favour of the sentence rankings. We propose an alternate method, content-based weighted consensus summarization, which address these concerns. We use pseudo-relevant summaries to estimate the performance of individual candidate systems, and then use this information to generate a better aggregate ranking. Experiments on DUC 2003 and DUC 2004 datasets show that the proposed system outperforms existing consensus-based techniques by a large margin.

多文档摘要在过去几十年中受到了极大的关注。已经提出了几种方法，其中许多方法表现相当好，并且越来越难以选择一种特定的系统。能够利用每个系统的优势的这种系统的集合可以构建更好和更强大的总结。尽管如此，这方面的尝试却很少。在本文中，我们描述了一个使用候选系统之间的共识来构建更好的元总结的集合系统。我们强调这样的系统的两个主要缺点：无法考虑个体系统的相对表现，忽略候选摘要的内容而支持句子排名。我们提出了一种替代方法，即基于内容的加权共识汇总，这解决了这些问题。我们使用伪相关摘要来估计个别候选系统的性能，然后使用这些信息来产生更好的总体排名。在DUC 2003和DUC 2004数据集上的实验表明，所提出的系统大大优于现有的基于共识的技术。
