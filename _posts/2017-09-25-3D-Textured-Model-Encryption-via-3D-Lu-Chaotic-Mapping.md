##### Abstract
In the coming Virtual/Augmented Reality (VR/AR) era, 3D contents will be popularized just as images and videos today. The security and privacy of these 3D contents should be taken into consideration. 3D contents contain surface models and solid models. The surface models include point clouds, meshes and textured models. Previous work mainly focus on encryption of solid models, point clouds and meshes. This work focuses on the most complicated 3D textured model. We propose a 3D Lu chaotic mapping based encryption method of 3D textured model. We encrypt the vertexes, the polygons and the textures of 3D models separately using the 3D Lu chaotic mapping. Then the encrypted vertices, edges and texture maps are composited together to form the final encrypted 3D textured model. The experimental results reveal that our method can encrypt and decrypt 3D textured models correctly. In addition, our method can resistant several attacks such as brute-force attack and statistic attack.

在即将到来的虚拟/增强现实（VR / AR）时代，3D内容将像今天的图像和视频一样普及。这些3D内容的安全性和隐私性应该被考虑在内。 3D内容包含表面模型和实体模型。表面模型包括点云，网格和纹理模型。以前的工作主要集中在实体模型，点云和网格的加密上。这项工作专注于最复杂的3D纹理模型。我们提出了一种基于3D Lu混沌映射的3D纹理模型加密方法。我们分别使用3D Lu混沌映射对3D模型的顶点，多边形和纹理进行加密。然后将加密的顶点，边和纹理图合成在一起，形成最终的加密3D纹理模型。实验结果表明，我们的方法可以正确加密和解​​密3D纹理模型。另外，我们的方法可以抵抗诸如暴力攻击和统计攻击等多种攻击。
