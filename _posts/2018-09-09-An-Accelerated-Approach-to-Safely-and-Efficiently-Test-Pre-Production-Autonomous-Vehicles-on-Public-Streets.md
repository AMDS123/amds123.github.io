##### Abstract
Various automobile and mobility companies, for instance Ford, Uber and Waymo, are currently testing their pre-produced autonomous vehicle (AV) fleets on the public roads. However, due to rareness of the safety-critical cases and, effectively, unlimited number of possible traffic scenarios, these on-road testing efforts have been acknowledged as tedious, costly, and risky. In this study, we propose Accelerated De- ployment framework to safely and efficiently estimate the AVs performance on public streets. We showed that by appropriately addressing the gradual accuracy improvement and adaptively selecting meaningful and safe environment under which the AV is deployed, the proposed framework yield to highly accurate estimation with much faster evaluation time, and more importantly, lower deployment risk. Our findings provide an answer to the currently heated and active discussions on how to properly test AV performance on public roads so as to achieve safe, efficient, and statistically-reliable testing framework for AV technologies.

各种汽车和移动公司，例如福特，优步和Waymo，目前正在公共道路上测试他们的预制自动驾驶车辆（AV）车队。然而，由于安全关键案例的罕见性以及实际上无限数量的可能交通场景，这些道路测试工作被认为是乏味，昂贵且具有风险的。在本研究中，我们提出加速部署框架，以安全有效地估算公共街道上的AV表现。我们通过适当地解决逐步准确性改进和自适应地选择部署AV的有意义和安全的环境表明，所提出的框架产生高度准确的估计，更快的评估时间，更重要的是，降低部署风险。我们的研究结果为目前如何在公共道路上正确测试AV性能的热烈讨论提供了答案，以便为AV技术实现安全，高效和统计可靠的测试框架。
