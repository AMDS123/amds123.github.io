##### Abstract
For many real applications, it is equally important to detect objects accurately and quickly. In this paper, we propose an accurate and efficient single shot object detector with fea-ture aggregation and enhancement (FAENet). Our motivation is to enhance and exploit the shallow and deep feature maps of the whole network simultaneously. For achieving this, we introduce a pair of novel feature aggregation modules and two feature enhancement blocks, and integrate them into the original structure of SSD. Extensive experiments on both PASCAL VOC and MS COCO datasets demonstrate that the proposed method achieves much higher accuracy than SSD. In addition, our method performs better than the state-of-the-art one-stage method RefineDet on small objects and can run at a faster speed.
