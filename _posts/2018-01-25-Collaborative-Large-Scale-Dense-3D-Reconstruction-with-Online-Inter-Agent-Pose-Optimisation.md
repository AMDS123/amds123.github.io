##### Abstract
Reconstructing dense, volumetric models of real-world 3D scenes is important for many tasks, but capturing large scenes can take significant time, and the risk of transient changes to the scene goes up as the capture time increases. These are good reasons to want instead to capture several smaller sub-scenes that can be joined to make the whole scene. Achieving this has traditionally been difficult: joining sub-scenes that may never have been viewed from the same angle requires a high-quality relocaliser that can cope with novel poses, and tracking drift in each sub-scene can prevent them from being joined to make a consistent overall scene. Recent advances in mobile hardware, however, have significantly improved our ability to capture medium-sized sub-scenes with little to no tracking drift. Moreover, high-quality regression forest-based relocalisers have recently been made more practical by the introduction of a method to allow them to be trained and used online. In this paper, we leverage these advances to present what to our knowledge is the first system to allow multiple users to collaborate interactively to reconstruct dense, voxel-based models of whole buildings. Using our system, an entire house or lab can be captured and reconstructed in under half an hour using only consumer-grade hardware.

重建真实世界3D场景的密集体积模型对于许多任务来说非常重要，但是捕捉大型场景需要花费大量时间，随着捕获时间的增加，场景瞬态变化的风险也会随之增加。这些是很好的理由，而不是要捕捉几个可以加入到整个场景中的较小的子场景。实现这一点在传统上是困难的：加入从未从相同角度观看的子场景需要高质量的重新定位器来处理新颖的姿势，并且跟踪每个子场景中的漂移可以防止它们被联合起来整体情况一致然而，最近在移动硬件方面的进步显着提高了我们捕捉中等大小的子场景的能力，几乎没有跟踪漂移。此外，通过引入一种方法使其能够在线训练和使用，最近已经使高质量的回归森林型重新定位器变得更为实用。在本文中，我们利用这些进步来展示我们所知道的第一个系统，它允许多个用户交互式协作，重建整个建筑物的密集的基于体素的模型。使用我们的系统，整个房屋或实验室可以在半小时内使用消费级硬件进行采集和重建。
