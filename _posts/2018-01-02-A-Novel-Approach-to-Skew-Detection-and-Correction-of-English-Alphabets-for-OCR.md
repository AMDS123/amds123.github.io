##### Abstract
Optical Character Recognition has been a challenging field in the advent of digital computers. It is needed where information is to be readable both to humans and machines. The process of OCR is composed of a set of pre and post processing steps that decide the level of accuracy of recognition. This paper deals with one of the pre-processing steps involved in the OCR process i.e. Skew (Slant) Detection and Correction. The proposed algorithm implemented for skew-detection is termed as the COG (Centre of Gravity) method and for that of skew-correction is Sub-Pixel Shifting method. The algorithm has been kept simple and optimized for efficient skew-detection and correction. The performance analysis of the algorithm after testing has been aptly demonstrated.

光学字符识别一直是数字计算机出现的一个具有挑战性的领域。需要信息可以被人类和机器读取的地方。 OCR的过程由一组决定识别准确度的前后处理步骤组成。本文涉及OCR过程中涉及的一个预处理步骤，即倾斜（倾斜）检测和校正。所提出的用于偏斜检测的算法被称为COG（重心）方法，并且用于偏斜校正的算法是子像素偏移（Sub-Pixel Shifting）方法。该算法一直保持简单和优化的高效偏斜检测和纠正。经过测试的算法性能分析得到了充分的证明。
