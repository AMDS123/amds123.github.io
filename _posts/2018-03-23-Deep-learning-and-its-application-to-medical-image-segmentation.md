##### Abstract
One of the most common tasks in medical imaging is semantic segmentation. Achieving this segmentation automatically has been an active area of research, but the task has been proven very challenging due to the large variation of anatomy across different patients. However, recent advances in deep learning have made it possible to significantly improve the performance of image recognition and semantic segmentation methods in the field of computer vision. Due to the data driven approaches of hierarchical feature learning in deep learning frameworks, these advances can be translated to medical images without much difficulty. Several variations of deep convolutional neural networks have been successfully applied to medical images. Especially fully convolutional architectures have been proven efficient for segmentation of 3D medical images. In this article, we describe how to build a 3D fully convolutional network (FCN) that can process 3D images in order to produce automatic semantic segmentations. The model is trained and evaluated on a clinical computed tomography (CT) dataset and shows state-of-the-art performance in multi-organ segmentation.

在医学成像中最常见的任务之一是语义分割。自动实现这种分割一直是一个活跃的研究领域，但由于不同患者的解剖结构差异很大，这项任务已被证明非常具有挑战性。然而，深度学习的最新进展使得显着提高计算机视觉领域中的图像识别和语义分割方法的性能成为可能。由于在深度学习框架中采用数据驱动的分层特征学习方法，这些进步可以毫不费力地转化为医学图像。深卷积神经网络的几种变体已成功应用于医学图像。特别是完全卷积体系结构已被证明是有效的3D医学图像分割。在本文中，我们将介绍如何构建一个可以处理3D图像以产生自动语义分割的3D完全卷积网络（FCN）。该模型经过临床计算机断层扫描（CT）数据集的训练和评估，并显示了多器官分割的最新性能。
