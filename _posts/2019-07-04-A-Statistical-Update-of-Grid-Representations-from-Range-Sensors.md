##### Abstract
In a wide range of robotic applications, being able to create a 3D model of the surrounding environment is a key feature for autonomous tasks. In this research report, we present a statistical model to perform 3D reconstructions of the environment from range sensors using an occupancy grid. To do so, we take into account all the available information obtained from the sensor, considering the distances traversed by the rays in each cell and seeking to reduce reconstruction errors caused by discretization. The approach has been validated qualitatively using the KITTI dataset.
