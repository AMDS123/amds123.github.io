##### Abstract
Conventional methods for facial age analysis tend to utilize accurate age labels in a supervised way. However, existing age datasets lies in a limited range of ages, leading to a long-tailed distribution. To alleviate the problem, this paper proposes a Universal Variational Aging (UVA) framework to formulate facial age priors in a disentangling manner. Benefiting from the variational evidence lower bound, the facial images are encoded and disentangled into an age-irrelevant distribution and an age-related distribution in the latent space. A conditional introspective adversarial learning mechanism is introduced to boost the image quality. In this way, when manipulating the age-related distribution, UVA can achieve age translation with arbitrary ages. Further, by sampling noise from the age-irrelevant distribution, we can generate photorealistic facial images with a specific age. Moreover, given an input face image, the mean value of age-related distribution can be treated as an age estimator. These indicate that UVA can efficiently and accurately estimate the age-related distribution by a disentangling manner, even if the training dataset performs a long-tailed age distribution. UVA is the first attempt to achieve facial age analysis tasks, including age translation, age generation and age estimation, in a universal framework. The qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate the superiority of UVA on five popular datasets, including CACD2000, Morph, UTKFace, MegaAge-Asian and FG-NET.
