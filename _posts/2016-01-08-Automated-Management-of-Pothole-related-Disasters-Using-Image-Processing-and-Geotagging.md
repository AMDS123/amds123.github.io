##### Abstract
Potholes though seem inconsequential, may cause accidents resulting in loss of human life. In this paper, we present an automated system to efficiently manage the potholes in a ward by deploying geotagging and image processing techniques that overcomes the drawbacks associated with the existing survey-oriented systems. Image processing is used for identification of target pothole regions in the 2D images using edge detection and morphological image processing operations. A method is developed to accurately estimate the dimensions of the potholes from their images, analyze their area and depth, estimate the quantity of filling material required and therefore enabling pothole attendance on a priority basis. This will further enable the government official to have a fully automated system for effectively managing pothole related disasters.

坑洼似乎无足轻重，可能会造成事故，导致人命丧失。在本文中，我们提出了一种自动化系统，通过部署地理标记和图像处理技术来有效管理病房的坑洞，克服了现有的面向调查的系统的缺点。图像处理用于使用边缘检测和形态学图像处理操作来识别2D图像中的目标坑洞区域。开发了一种方法，根据图像准确估算坑洼大小，分析其面积和深度，估算所需填充材料的数量，从而优先考虑坑洼。这将进一步使政府官员有一个完全自动化的系统来有效管理坑洼相关的灾难。
