##### Abstract
The most famous single-player card game is 'Klondike', but our ignorance of its winnability percentage has been called "one of the embarrassments of applied mathematics". Klondike is just one of many single-player card games, generically called 'patience' or 'solitaire' games, for which players have long wanted to know how likely a particular game is to be winnable for a random deal. A number of different games have been studied empirically in the academic literature and by non-academic enthusiasts. Here we show that a single general purpose Artificial Intelligence program, called "Solvitaire", can be used to determine the winnability percentage of approximately 30 different single-player card games with a 95\% confidence interval of +/- 0.1\% or better. For example, we report the winnability of Klondike as 81.956% +/- 0.096% (in the 'thoughtful' variant where the player knows the location of all cards), a 30-fold reduction in confidence interval over the best previous result. Almost all our results are either entirely new or represent significant improvements on previous knowledge.
