##### Abstract
In recent years, three-dimensional GaN-based transistors have been intensively studied for their dramatically improved output power, better gate controllability, and shorter channels for speedup and miniaturization. However, thermal analysis of such devices is often oversimplified using the conventional Fourier's law and bulk material properties in thermal simulations. In this aspect, accurate temperature predictions can be achieved by coupled phonon and electron Monte Carlo simulations that track the movement and scattering of individual phonons and electrons. However, the heavy computational load often restricts such simulations to nanoscale devices, while a real chip is of millimeter to centimeter sizes. This issue can be addressed by a hybrid simulation technique that employs the Fourier's law for regions away from the hot spot. Using this technique, accurate electrothermal simulations are carried out on a nanowire-based GaN transistor to reveal the temperature rise in such devices.

近年来，三维氮化镓基晶体管的输出功率大大提高，栅极控制性能更好，加速和微型化的通道也越来越短。然而，在热模拟中，使用传统的傅里叶定律和散装材料性质，这种装置的热分析通常被过分简化。在这方面，通过耦合声子和电子Monte Carlo模拟来实现准确的温度预测，该模拟跟踪单个声子和电子的移动和散射。然而，大量的计算负载通常将这种模拟限制在纳米尺寸的器件上，而真正的芯片尺寸是毫米到厘米。这个问题可以通过采用傅里叶定律的混合模拟技术来解决。使用这种技术，在基于纳米线的GaN晶体管上进行准确的电热模拟以揭示这种器件中的温度升高。
