##### Abstract
The SLEUTH model, based on the Cellular Automata (CA), can be applied to city development simulation in metropolitan areas. In this study the SLEUTH model was used to model the urban expansion and predict the future possible behavior of the urban growth in Tehran. The fundamental data were five Landsat TM and ETM images of 1988, 1992, 1998, 2001 and 2010. Three scenarios were designed to simulate the spatial pattern. The first scenario assumed historical urbanization mode would persist and the only limitations for development were height and slope. The second one was a compact scenario which makes the growth mostly internal and limited the expansion of suburban areas. The last scenario proposed a polycentric urban structure which let the little patches grow without any limitation and would not consider the areas beyond the specific buffer zone from the larger patches for development. Results showed that the urban growth rate was greater in the first scenario in comparison with the other two scenarios. Also it was shown that the third scenario was more suitable for Tehran since it could avoid undesirable effects such as congestion and pollution and was more in accordance with the conditions of Tehran city.

基于元胞自动机（CA）的SLEUTH模型可应用于大都市地区的城市开发模拟。在这项研究中，SLEUTH模型被用来模拟城市扩张，并预测未来德黑兰城市增长的可能行为。基本数据是1988年，1992年，1998年，2001年和2010年的5幅Landsat TM和ETM图像。设计了三个场景来模拟空间格局。假定历史城市化模式的第一种情景将持续存在，发展的唯一限制是高度和坡度。第二个是紧凑的情景，使得增长大部分是内部的，限制了郊区的扩张。最后一个场景提出了一个多中心的城市结构，让小补丁没有任何限制地增长，不会从更大的补丁发展的角度考虑特定缓冲区以外的区域。结果显示，与其他两种情景相比，第一种情景下的城市增长率更高。同时也表明，第三种情况更适合德黑兰，因为它可以避免交通堵塞和污染等不利影响，更符合德黑兰市的条件。
