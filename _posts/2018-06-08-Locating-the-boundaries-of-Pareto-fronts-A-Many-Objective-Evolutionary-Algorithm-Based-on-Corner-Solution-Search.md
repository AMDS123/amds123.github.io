##### Abstract
In this paper, an evolutionary many-objective optimization algorithm based on corner solution search (MaOEA-CS) was proposed. MaOEA-CS implicitly contains two phases: the exploitative search for the most important boundary optimal solutions - corner solutions, at the first phase, and the use of angle-based selection [1] with the explorative search for the extension of PF approximation at the second phase. Due to its high efficiency and robustness to the shapes of PFs, it has won the CEC'2017 Competition on Evolutionary Many-Objective Optimization. In addition, MaOEA-CS has also been applied on two real-world engineering optimization problems with very irregular PFs. The experimental results show that MaOEA-CS outperforms other six state-of-the-art compared algorithms, which indicates it has the ability to handle real-world complex optimization problems with irregular PFs.

本文提出了一种基于角解搜索的进化多目标优化算法（MaOEA-CS）。 MaOEA-CS隐含地包含两个阶段：在第一阶段利用搜索最重要的边界最优解 - 角解，以及使用基于角度的选择[1]与探索性地搜索PF近似的扩展第二阶段。由于其高效率和对PF形状的稳健性，它赢得了CEC'2017进化多目标优化竞赛。另外，MaOEA-CS也被应用于非常不规则的PF的两个实际工程优化问题。实验结果表明，MaOEA-CS优于其他六种最先进的比较算法，这表明它具有处理现实世界中不规则PF的复杂优化问题的能力。
