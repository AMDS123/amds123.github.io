##### Abstract
Many types of 3D acquisition sensors have emerged in recent years and point cloud has been widely used in many areas. Accurate and fast registration of cross-source 3D point clouds from different sensors is an emerged research problem in computer vision. This problem is extremely challenging because cross-source point clouds contain a mixture of various variances, such as density, partial overlap, large noise and outliers, viewpoint changing. In this paper, an algorithm is proposed to align cross-source point clouds with both high accuracy and high efficiency. There are two main contributions: firstly, two components, the weak region affinity and pixel-wise refinement, are proposed to maintain the global and local information of 3D point clouds. Then, these two components are integrated into an iterative tensor-based registration algorithm to solve the cross-source point cloud registration problem. We conduct experiments on synthetic cross-source benchmark dataset and real cross-source datasets. Comparison with six state-of-the-art methods, the proposed method obtains both higher efficiency and accuracy.
