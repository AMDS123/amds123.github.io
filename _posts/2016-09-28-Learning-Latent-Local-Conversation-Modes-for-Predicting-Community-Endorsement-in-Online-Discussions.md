##### Abstract
Many social media platforms offer a mechanism for readers to react to comments, both positively and negatively, which in aggregate can be thought of as community endorsement. This paper addresses the problem of predicting community endorsement in online discussions, leveraging both the participant response structure and the text of the comment. The different types of features are integrated in a neural network that uses a novel architecture to learn latent modes of discussion structure that perform as well as deep neural networks but are more interpretable. In addition, the latent modes can be used to weight text features thereby improving prediction accuracy.

##### Abstract (translated by Google)
许多社交媒体平台为读者提供了积极和消极评论的机制，总体上可以被认为是社区的认可。本文讨论了在线讨论中预测社区认可的问题，利用参与者的回应结构和评论文本。不同类型的特征集成在神经网络中，该神经网络使用新颖的体系结构来学习讨论结构的潜在模式，该深度模式的表现与深度神经网络一样好，但更易于理解。另外，潜在模式可用于对文本特征进行加权，从而提高预测的准确性。
