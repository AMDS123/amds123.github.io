##### Abstract
We study digital images of r-regular objects where a pixel is black if it is completely inside the object, white if it is completely inside the complement of the object, and grey otherwise. We call such images trinary. We discuss possible configurations of pixels in trinary images of r-regular objects at certain resolutions and propose a method for reconstructing objects from such images. We show that the reconstructed object is close to the original object in Hausdorff norm, and that there is a homeomorphism of the plane taking the reconstructed set to the original.
