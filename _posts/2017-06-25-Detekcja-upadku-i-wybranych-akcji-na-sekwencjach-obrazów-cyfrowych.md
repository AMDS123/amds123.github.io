##### Abstract
In recent years a growing interest on action recognition is observed, including detection of fall accident for the elderly. However, despite many efforts undertaken, the existing technology is not widely used by elderly, mainly because of its flaws like low precision, large number of false alarms, inadequate privacy preserving during data acquisition and processing. This research work meets these expectations. The work is empirical and it is situated in the field of computer vision systems. The main part of the work situates itself in the area of action and behavior recognition. Efficient algorithms for fall detection were developed, tested and implemented using image sequences and wireless inertial sensor worn by a monitored person. A set of descriptors for depth maps has been elaborated to permit classification of pose as well as the action of a person. Experimental research was carried out based on the prepared data repository consisting of synchronized depth and accelerometric data. The study was carried out in the scenario with a static camera facing the scene and an active camera observing the scene from above. The experimental results showed that the developed algorithms for fall detection have high sensitivity and specificity. The algorithm were designed with regard to low computational demands and possibility to run on ARM platforms. Several experiments including person detection, tracking and fall detection in real-time were carried out to show efficiency and reliability of the proposed solutions.

近年来，人们越来越关注行为识别，包括检测老年人跌倒事故。然而，尽管已经做了很多努力，现有的技术并没有被老年人普遍使用，主要是因为它存在精度低，误报数量大，数据采集和处理过程中隐私保护不足等缺陷。这项研究工作符合这些期望。这项工作是经验性的，位于计算机视觉系统领域。作品的主要部分位于行为和行为识别领域。开发了用于跌倒检测的高效算法，并使用监控人员佩戴的图像序列和无线惯性传感器进行测试和实施。已经详细描述了一组深度图描述符，以允许分类姿势以及人的动作。实验研究基于由同步深度和加速度计数据组成的准备好的数据库进行。研究是在场景中使用静态摄像机进行的，场景中有一台摄像机从上方观察场景。实验结果表明，所开发的跌倒检测算法具有较高的灵敏度和特异性。该算法是针对低计算需求和在ARM平台上运行的可能性而设计的。为了显示所提出的解决方案的效率和可靠性，进行了包括人员检测，实时跟踪和跌倒检测在内的多个实验。
