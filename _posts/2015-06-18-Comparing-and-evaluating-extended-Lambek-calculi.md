##### Abstract
Lambeks Syntactic Calculus, commonly referred to as the Lambek calculus, was innovative in many ways, notably as a precursor of linear logic. But it also showed that we could treat our grammatical framework as a logic (as opposed to a logical theory). However, though it was successful in giving at least a basic treatment of many linguistic phenomena, it was also clear that a slightly more expressive logical calculus was needed for many other cases. Therefore, many extensions and variants of the Lambek calculus have been proposed, since the eighties and up until the present day. As a result, there is now a large class of calculi, each with its own empirical successes and theoretical results, but also each with its own logical primitives. This raises the question: how do we compare and evaluate these different logical formalisms? To answer this question, I present two unifying frameworks for these extended Lambek calculi. Both are proof net calculi with graph contraction criteria. The first calculus is a very general system: you specify the structure of your sequents and it gives you the connectives and contractions which correspond to it. The calculus can be extended with structural rules, which translate directly into graph rewrite rules. The second calculus is first-order (multiplicative intuitionistic) linear logic, which turns out to have several other, independently proposed extensions of the Lambek calculus as fragments. I will illustrate the use of each calculus in building bridges between analyses proposed in different frameworks, in highlighting differences and in helping to identify problems.

##### Abstract (translated by Google)
Lambek句法微积分（通常称为Lambek微积分）在许多方面都是创新的，特别是作为线性逻辑的前兆。但是这也表明我们可以把我们的语法框架看作一种逻辑（而不是一种逻辑理论）。然而，尽管对许多语言现象至少是一种基本的处理方法是成功的，但很清楚的是，对于许多其他情况，还需要一个稍微更有表现力的逻辑演算。因此，从八十年代开始到现在，已经提出了很多延伸和变形的Lambek演算。因此，现在有大量的结石，每一个都有其自己的经验成果和理论结果，而且每一个都有自己的逻辑基元。这就产生了一个问题：我们如何比较和评估这些不同的逻辑形式？为了回答这个问题，我为这些扩展的Lambek结石提出了两个统一的框架。两者都是具有图形收缩标准的证明净结石。第一个微积分是一个非常一般的系统：你指定你的哨兵的结构，它给你与它相对应的连接词和缩写词。微积分可以用结构规则扩展，直接转换成图形重写规则。第二个微积分是一阶（乘性直觉主义）线性逻辑，其结果是将Lambek演算的其他几个独立提出的扩展作为片段。我将说明每种微积分在不同框架中提出的分析之间架起桥梁的过程中的用法，强调差异并帮助发现问题。
