##### Abstract
This review presents an in-depth study of the literature on segmentation methods applied in dental imaging. Ten segmentation methods were studied and categorized according to the type of the segmentation method (region-based, threshold-based, cluster-based, boundary-based or watershed-based), type of X-ray images used (intra-oral or extra-oral) and characteristics of the dataset used to evaluate the methods in the state-of-the-art works. We found that the literature has primarily focused on threshold-based segmentation methods (54%). 80% of the reviewed papers have used intra-oral X-ray images in their experiments, demonstrating preference to perform segmentation on images of already isolated parts of the teeth, rather than using extra-oral X-rays, which show tooth structure of the mouth and bones of the face. To fill a scientific gap in the field, a novel data set based on extra-oral X-ray images are proposed here. A statistical comparison of the results found with the 10 image segmentation methods over our proposed data set comprised of 1,500 images is also carried out, providing a more comprehensive source of performance assessment. Discussion on limitations of the methods conceived over the past year as well as future perspectives on exploiting learning-based segmentation methods to improve performance are also provided.

这篇综述对牙齿成像中应用的分割方法的文献进行了深入的研究。根据分割方法的类型（基于区域的，基于阈值的，基于聚类的，基于边界的或基于分水岭的），所使用的X射线图像的类型（口内或额外的 - 用于评估最先进作品中方法的数据集的特征和特征。我们发现文献主要集中在基于阈值的分割方法（54％）。在他们的实验中，80％的评论论文使用了口内X射线图像，表明优先对已经被隔离的部分的牙齿进行分割，而不是使用显示牙齿的牙齿结构的口外X射线嘴和脸的骨头。为填补该领域的科学空白，本文提出了一种基于口外X射线图像的新型数据集。在我们提出的包含1,500幅图像的数据集上对10幅图像分割方法所得结果进行统计比较，也提供了更全面的性能评估来源。讨论了过去一年构想方法的局限性，以及未来对利用基于学习的分割方法来提高性能的看法。
