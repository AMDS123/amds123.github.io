##### Abstract
Pre-aspiration is defined as the period of glottal friction occurring in sequences of vocalic/consonantal sonorants and phonetically voiceless obstruents. We propose two machine learning methods for automatic measurement of pre-aspiration duration: a feedforward neural network, which works at the frame level; and a structured prediction model, which relies on manually designed feature functions, and works at the segment level. The input for both algorithms is a speech signal of an arbitrary length containing a single obstruent, and the output is a pair of times which constitutes the pre-aspiration boundaries. We train both models on a set of manually annotated examples. Results suggest that the structured model is superior to the frame-based model as it yields higher accuracy in predicting the boundaries and generalizes to new speakers and new languages. Finally, we demonstrate the applicability of our structured prediction algorithm by replicating linguistic analysis of pre-aspiration in Aberystwyth English with high correlation.

预吸气被定义为在声/辅音超声声音和语音清音阻碍序列中发生声门摩擦的时期。我们提出了两种机器学习方法来自动测量吸气前的持续时间：前馈神经网络，它在帧级工作;和一个结构化的预测模型，它依赖于手动设计的特征函数，并在分段级别工作。两种算法的输入是包含单个阻塞的任意长度的语音信号，输出是构成预抽吸边界的一对时间。我们在一组手动注释的例子上训练两个模型。结果表明，结构化模型优于基于框架的模型，因为它在预测边界方面具有更高的准确性，并且推广到新的说话者和新语言。最后，我们证明了我们的结构化预测算法的适用性，通过在Aberystwyth英语中重复预先抽取的语言学分析，具有高相关性。
