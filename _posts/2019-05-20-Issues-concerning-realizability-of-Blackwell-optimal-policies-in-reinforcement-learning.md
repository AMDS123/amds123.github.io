##### Abstract
N-discount optimality was introduced as a hierarchical form of policy- and value-function optimality, with Blackwell optimality lying at the top level of the hierarchy Veinott (1969); Blackwell (1962). We formalize notions of myopic discount factors, value functions and policies in terms of Blackwell optimality in MDPs, and we provide a novel concept of regret, called Blackwell regret, which measures the regret compared to a Blackwell optimal policy. Our main analysis focuses on long horizon MDPs with sparse rewards. We show that selecting the discount factor under which zero Blackwell regret can be achieved becomes arbitrarily hard. Moreover, even with oracle knowledge of such a discount factor that can realize a Blackwell regret-free value function, an $\epsilon$-Blackwell optimal value function may not even be gain optimal. Difficulties associated with this class of problems is discussed, and the notion of a policy gap is defined as the difference in expected return between a given policy and any other policy that differs at that state; we prove certain properties related to this gap. Finally, we provide experimental results that further support our theoretical results.
