##### Abstract
Using the dielectric continuum (DC) and three-dimensional phonon (3DP) models, energy relaxation of the hot electrons in the quasi-two-dimensional channel of lattice-matched InAlN/AlN/GaN heterostructures is studied theoretically. The electron power dissipation and energy relaxation time due to both half-space and interface phonons are calculated as functions of the electron temperature $T_e$ using a variety of phonon lifetime values from experiment, and then compared with those evaluated by the 3DP model. The 3DP model yields very close results to the DC model: with no hot phonons or screening the power loss calculated from the 3DP model is 5% smaller than the DC power dissipation, whereas slightly larger 3DP power loss (by less than 4% with a phonon lifetime from 0.1 to 1 ps) is obtained throughout the electron temperature range from room temperature to 2500 K after including both the hot-phonon effect (HPE) and screening. Very close results are obtained also for energy relaxation time with the two phonon models (within a 5% of deviation). However the 3DP model is found to underestimate the HPE by 9%. The Mori-Ando sum rule is restored by which it is proved that the power dissipation values obtained from the DC and 3DP models are in general different in the pure phonon emission process, except when scattering with interface phonons is sufficiently weak, or when the degenerate modes condition is imposed, which is also consistent with Register's scattering rate sum rule. Our calculation with both phonon models has obtained a great fall in energy relaxation time at low electron temperatures ($T_e<$ 750 K) and slow decrease at the high temperatures. The calculated temperature dependence of the relaxation time and the high-temperature relaxation time $\sim$0.09 ps are in good agreement with experimental results.

利用介电连续谱（DC）和三维声子（3DP）模型，对晶格匹配的InAlN / AlN / GaN异质结构的准二维沟道热电子的能量弛豫进行了理论研究。利用实验得到的各种声子寿命值，计算了由于半空间和界面声子所引起的电子能量耗散和能量弛豫时间，并与电子温度$ T_e $的函数进行了比较，并与3DP模型进行了比较。 3DP模型对DC模型产生非常接近的结果：没有热声子或屏蔽从3DP模型计算的功率损耗比DC功耗小5％，而稍大的3DP功率损耗（小于4％声子寿命从0.1到1ps）在包括热声子效应（HPE）和筛选之后在整个从室温到2500K的电子温度范围内获得。对于两个声子模型（在5％的偏差内），能量弛豫时间也得到非常接近的结果。然而，3DP模型被发现低估了9％的HPE。 Mori-Ando求和规则被恢复，证明在纯声子发射过程中，从DC和3DP模型获得的功耗值一般是不同的，除了当界面声子散射足够弱或者退化时模式条件，这也符合登记册的散射率和规则。在低电子温度下（$ T_e <$ 750 K），我们用声子模型计算的能量弛豫时间大大降低，在高温下缓慢下降。计算得到的弛豫时间与高温弛豫时间的温度依赖关系与实验结果吻合较好。
