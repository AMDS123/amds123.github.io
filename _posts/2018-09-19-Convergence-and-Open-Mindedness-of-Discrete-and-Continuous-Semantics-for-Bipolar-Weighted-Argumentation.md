##### Abstract
Weighted bipolar argumentation frameworks determine the strength of arguments based on an initial weight and the strength of their attackers and supporters. They find applications in decision support and social media analysis. Mossakowski and Neuhaus recently introduced a unification of different models and gave sufficient conditions for convergence and divergence in cyclic graphs. We build up on this work, incorporate additional models and extend results in several directions. In particular, we explain that the convergence guarantees can be seen as special cases of the contraction principle. We use this observation to unify and to generalize results and add runtime guarantees. Unfortunately, we find that guarantees obtained in this way are bought at the expense of open-mindedness, that is, the ability to move strength values away from the initial weights. However, we also demonstrate that divergence problems can be solved without giving up open-mindedness by continuizing the models. Finally, we integrate the Duality property that assures a symmetric impact of attack and support relations into the framework by Mossakowski and Neuhaus.

##### Abstract (translated by Google)
加权双极论证框架根据初始权重和攻击者和支持者的力量来确定论证的强度。他们在决策支持和社交媒体分析中找到了应用。 Mossakowski和Neuhaus最近引入了不同模型的统一，并为循环图中的收敛和发散提供了充分条件。我们在这项工作的基础上，结合其他模型并将结果扩展到多个方向。特别是，我们解释收敛保证可以被视为收缩原则的特殊情况。我们使用此观察来统一并概括结果并添加运行时保证。不幸的是，我们发现以这种方式获得的保证是以牺牲开放性为代价来购买的，也就是说，能够将力量值从初始权重移开。然而，我们也证明了可以通过延续模型而不放弃开放的态度来解决分歧问题。最后，我们整合了Duality属性，确保攻击和支持关系的对称影响由Mossakowski和Neuhaus进入框架。
