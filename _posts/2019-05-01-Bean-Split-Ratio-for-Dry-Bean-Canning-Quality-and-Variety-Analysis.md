##### Abstract
Splits on canned beans appear in the process of preparation and canning. Researchers are studying how they are influenced by cooking environment and genotype. However, there is no existing method to automatically quantify or to characterize the severity of splits. To solve this, we propose two measures: the Bean Split Ratio (BSR) that quantifies the overall severity of splits, and the Bean Split Histogram (BSH) that characterizes the size distribution of splits. We create a pixel-wise segmentation method to automatically estimate these measures from images. We also present a bean dataset of recombinant inbred lines of two genotypes, use the BSR and BSH to assess canning quality, and explore heritability of these properties.
