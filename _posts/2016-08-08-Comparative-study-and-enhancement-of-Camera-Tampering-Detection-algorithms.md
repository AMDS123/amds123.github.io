##### Abstract
Recently the use of video surveillance systems is widely increasing. Different places are equipped by camera surveillances such as hospitals, schools, airports, museums and military places in order to ensure the safety and security of the persons and their property. Therefore it becomes significant to guarantee the proper working of these systems. Intelligent video surveillance systems equipped by sophisticated digital camera can analyze video information s and automatically detect doubtful actions. The camera tampering detection algorithms may indicate that accidental or suspicious activities have occurred and that causes the abnormality works of the video surveillance. Camera Tampering Detection uses several techniques based on image processing and computer vision. In this paper, comparative study of performance of three algorithms that can detect abnormal disturbance for video surveillance is presented.

近来，视频监控系统的使用正在增加。为了确保人身和财产安全，不同的地方配备了医院，学校，机场，博物馆，军事场所等摄像机监视设备。因此保证这些系统的正常工作变得重要。采用先进的数码相机配备的智能视频监控系统可以对视频信息进行分析，自动检测可疑行为。摄像机篡改检测算法可能表明发生了意外或可疑活动，并导致了视频监控的异常工作。相机篡改检测使用了几种基于图像处理和计算机视觉的技术。本文提出了三种可以检测异常干扰的视频监控算法的性能比较。
