##### Abstract
A common and effective way to train translation systems between related languages is to consider sub-word level basic units. However, this increases the length of the sentences resulting in increased decoding time. The increase in length is also impacted by the specific choice of data format for representing the sentences as subwords. In a phrase-based SMT framework, we investigate different choices of decoder parameters as well as data format and their impact on decoding time and translation accuracy. We suggest best options for these settings that significantly improve decoding time with little impact on the translation accuracy.

在相关语言之间培训翻译系统的一种常见而有效的方法是考虑分词水平的基本单位。但是，这增加了句子的长度，导致解码时间增加。长度的增加也受到用于将句子表示为子词的数据格式的具体选择的影响。在基于短语的SMT框架中，我们研究了解码器参数的不同选择以及数据格式及其对解码时间和翻译准确度的影响。我们建议这些设置的最佳选项，大大提高解码时间，对翻译准确性影响不大。
