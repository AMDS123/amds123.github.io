##### Abstract
Tracking multiple objects is a challenging task when objects move in groups and occlude each other. Existing methods have investigated the problems of group division and group energy-minimization; however, lacking overall object-group topology modeling limits their ability in handling complex object and group dynamics. Inspired with the social affinity property of moving objects, we propose a Graphical Social Topology (GST) model, which estimates the group dynamics by jointly modeling the group structure and the states of objects using a topological representation. With such topology representation, moving objects are not only assigned to groups, but also dynamically connected with each other, which enables in-group individuals to be correctly associated and the cohesion of each group to be precisely modeled. Using well-designed topology learning modules and topology training, we infer the birth/death and merging/splitting of dynamic groups. With the GST model, the proposed multi-object tracker can naturally facilitate the occlusion problem by treating the occluded object and other in-group members as a whole while leveraging overall state transition. Experiments on both RGB and RGB-D datasets confirm that the proposed multi-object tracker improves the state-of-the-arts especially in crowded scenes.

跟踪多个对象是一个具有挑战性的任务，当对象在组中移动并相互闭塞时。现有方法研究了群体划分和群体能量最小化的问题，然而，缺乏全面的对象组拓扑建模限制了他们处理复杂对象和组动力的能力。受移动对象的社会亲和属性的启发，我们提出了一个图形社会拓扑（GST）模型，该模型通过使用拓扑表示来联合建模组结构和对象状态来估计组动态。通过这样的拓扑表示，移动对象不仅被分配给组，而且也被动态地相互连接，这使得组内个体能够被正确地关联并且每个组的内聚被精确建模。使用设计良好的拓扑学习模块和拓扑训练，我们推断动态组的出生/死亡和合并/分裂。利用GST模型，所提出的多目标跟踪器在利用整体状态转换的同时，通过将遮挡物体和其他组内成员作为一个整体对待，可以自然地促进遮挡问题。对RGB和RGB-D数据集的实验证实，所提出的多目标跟踪器改善了现有技术，特别是在拥挤的场景中。
