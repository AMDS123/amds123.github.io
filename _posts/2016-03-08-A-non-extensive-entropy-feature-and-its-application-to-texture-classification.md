##### Abstract
This paper proposes a new probabilistic non-extensive entropy feature for texture characterization, based on a Gaussian information measure. The highlights of the new entropy are that it is bounded by finite limits and that it is non additive in nature. The non additive property of the proposed entropy makes it useful for the representation of information content in the non-extensive systems containing some degree of regularity or correlation. The effectiveness of the proposed entropy in representing the correlated random variables is demonstrated by applying it for the texture classification problem since textures found in nature are random and at the same time contain some degree of correlation or regularity at some scale. The gray level co-occurrence probabilities (GLCP) are used for computing the entropy function. The experimental results indicate high degree of the classification accuracy. The performance of the new entropy function is found superior to other forms of entropy such as Shannon, Renyi, Tsallis and Pal and Pal entropies on comparison. Using the feature based polar interaction maps (FBIM) the proposed entropy is shown to be the best measure among the entropies compared for representing the correlated textures.

本文提出了一种基于高斯信息度量的纹理特征的概率非广泛熵特征。新熵的亮点在于它受限于有限的范围，而且它本质上是非加性的。所提出的熵的非加法性质使得它在包含一定程度的规律性或相关性的非广泛系统中表示信息内容是有用的。所提出的熵在表示相关随机变量中的有效性通过将其应用于纹理分类问题来证明，因为在自然界中发现的纹理是随机的并且同时在某个尺度上包含一定程度的相关性或规律性。灰度共生概率（GLCP）用于计算熵函数。实验结果表明分类精度高。新熵函数的性能优于其他形式的熵，如Shannon，Renyi，Tsallis和Pal和Pal熵。使用基于特征的极性相互作用图（FBIM），所提出的熵显示为用于表示相关纹理的熵比较中的最佳度量。
