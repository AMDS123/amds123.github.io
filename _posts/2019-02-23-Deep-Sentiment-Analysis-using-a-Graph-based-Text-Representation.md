##### Abstract
Social media brings about new ways of communication among people and is influencing trading strategies in the market. The popularity of social networks produces a large collection of unstructured data such as text and image in a variety of disciplines like business and health. The main element of social media arises as text which provokes a set of challenges for traditional information retrieval and natural language processing tools. Informal language, spelling errors, abbreviations, and special characters are typical in social media posts. These features lead to a prohibitively large vocabulary size for text mining methods. Another problem with traditional social text mining techniques is that they fail to take semantic relations into account, which is essential in a domain of applications such as event detection, opinion mining, and news recommendation. This paper set out to employ a network-based viewpoint on text documents and investigate the usefulness of graph representation to exploit word relations and semantics of the textual data. Moreover, the proposed approach makes use of a random walker to extract deep features of a graph to facilitate the task of document classification. The experimental results indicate that the proposed approach defeats the earlier sentiment analysis methods based on several benchmark datasets, and it generalizes well on different datasets without dependency for pre-trained word embeddings.
