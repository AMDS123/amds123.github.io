##### Abstract
Obstacle avoidance is a key feature for safe Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) navigation. While solutions have been proposed for static obstacle avoidance, systems enabling avoidance of dynamic objects, such as drones, are hard to implement due to the detection range and field-of-view (FOV) requirements, as well as the constraints for integrating such systems on-board small UAVs. In this work, a dataset of 6k synthetic depth maps of drones has been generated and used to train a state-of-the-art deep learning-based drone detection model. While many sensing technologies can only provide relative altitude and azimuth of an obstacle, our depth map-based approach enables full 3D localization of the obstacle. This is extremely useful for collision avoidance, as 3D localization of detected drones is key to perform efficient collision-free path planning. The proposed detection technique has been validated in several real depth map sequences, with multiple types of drones flying at up to 2 m/s, achieving an average precision of 98.7%, an average recall of 74.7% and a record detection range of 9.5 meters.

避障是安全无人机（UAV）导航的关键特征。虽然已经提出了避免静态避障的解决方案，但由于检测范围和视场（FOV）要求以及集成这些系统的限制因素，难以实现避免动态物体（例如无人机）的系统。机载小型无人机。在这项工作中，已生成6k合成无人机深度图的数据集，并用于训练最先进的基于深度学习的无人机探测模型。虽然许多传感技术只能提供障碍物的相对高度和方位角，但我们基于深度图的方法可以实现障碍物的全3D定位。这对于避免碰撞非常有用，因为检测到的无人机的3D定位是执行有效的无碰撞路径规划的关键。所提出的检测技术已在多个真实深度图序列中得到验证，多种类型的无人机以高达2 m / s的速度飞行，平均精度为98.7％，平均召回率为74.7％，记录检测范围为9.5米。 。
