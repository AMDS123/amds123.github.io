##### Abstract
We report the degree of order of twenty-two Jackson Pollock's paintings using \emph{Hausdorff-Besicovitch fractal dimension}. Through the maximum value of each multi-fractal spectrum, the artworks are classify by the year in which they were painted. It has been reported that Pollock's paintings are fractal and it increased on his latest works. However our results show that fractal dimension of the paintings are on a range of fractal dimension with values close to two. We identify this behavior as a fractal-order transition. Based on the study of disorder-order transition in physical systems, we interpreted the fractal-order transition through its dark paint strokes in Pollocks' paintings, as structured lines following a power law measured by fractal dimension. We obtain self-similarity in some specific Pollock's paintings, that reveal an important dependence on the scale of observation. We also characterize by its fractal spectrum, the called \emph{Teri's Find}. We obtained similar spectrums between \emph{Teri's Find} and \emph{Number 5} from Pollock, suggesting that fractal dimension cannot be completely rejected as a quantitative parameter to authenticate this kind of artworks.

##### Abstract (translated by Google)
我们使用\ emph {Hausdorff-Besicovitch分形维度}报告二十二个杰克逊·波洛克的绘画的秩序的程度。通过每个多重分形谱的最大值，艺术作品按其绘制年份进行分类。据报道，波洛克的绘画是分形的，他的最新作品增加了。然而，我们的结果表明，绘画的分形维数在一个分维值的范围内，值接近2。我们将这种行为确定为分形顺序的转换。在对物理系统无序阶跃的研究的基础上，我们通过波洛克的绘画中的黑色笔画来解释分形序列的转变，结构化的线条遵循分形维度测量的幂律。我们在一些特定的波洛克的绘画中获得了自相似性，揭示了对观察尺度的重要依赖。我们还用它的分形谱来描述被称为\ Terph {Teri's Find}的特征。我们从Pollock获得了\ emph {Teri's Find}和\ emph {Number 5}之间的类似谱，表明分形维数不能被完全拒绝作为验证这种艺术品的量化参数。
