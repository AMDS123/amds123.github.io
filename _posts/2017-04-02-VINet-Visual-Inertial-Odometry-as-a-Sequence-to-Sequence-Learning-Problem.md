##### Abstract
In this paper we present an on-manifold sequence-to-sequence learning approach to motion estimation using visual and inertial sensors. It is to the best of our knowledge the first end-to-end trainable method for visual-inertial odometry which performs fusion of the data at an intermediate feature-representation level. Our method has numerous advantages over traditional approaches. Specifically, it eliminates the need for tedious manual synchronization of the camera and IMU as well as eliminating the need for manual calibration between the IMU and camera. A further advantage is that our model naturally and elegantly incorporates domain specific information which significantly mitigates drift. We show that our approach is competitive with state-of-the-art traditional methods when accurate calibration data is available and can be trained to outperform them in the presence of calibration and synchronization errors.

在本文中，我们提出了一个使用视觉和惯性传感器的运动估计的在流形序列 - 序列学习方法。据我们所知，第一种用于视觉 - 惯性测距法的端对端可训练方法是在中间特征表示水平上执行数据融合。我们的方法比传统方法有许多优点。具体而言，无需繁琐的手动同步相机和IMU，也无需在IMU和相机之间进行手动校准。另一个优点是我们的模型自然而优雅地结合了特定领域的信息，大大减轻了漂移。我们表明，当准确的校准数据可用时，我们的方法与最先进的传统方法相比具有竞争力，并且可以在存在校准和同步错误的情况下对其进行训练。
