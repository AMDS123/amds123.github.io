##### Abstract
This paper outlines the results of sentence level linguistics based rules for improving part-of-speech tagging. It is well known that the performance of complex NLP systems is negatively affected if one of the preliminary stages is less than perfect. Errors in the initial stages in the pipeline have a snowballing effect on the pipeline's end performance. We have created a set of linguistics based rules at the sentence level which adjust part-of-speech tags from state-of-the-art taggers. Comparison with state-of-the-art taggers on widely used benchmarks demonstrate significant improvements in tagging accuracy and consequently in the quality and accuracy of NLP systems.

##### Abstract (translated by Google)
本文概述了基于句级语言学的改进词性标注规则的结果。众所周知，如果其中一个初始阶段不够完善，复杂NLP系统的性能会受到负面影响。管道初始阶段的错误对管道终端性能产生滚雪球效应。我们在句子级创建了一套基于语言学的规则，从最先进的标注器调整词性标签。在广泛使用的基准上与最先进的标记器进行比较，证明了标记精度的显着提高，从而显着提高了NLP系统的质量和精度。
