##### Abstract
We present a novel intelligent tutoring system which builds upon well-established hypotheses in educational psychology and incorporates them inside of a scalable software architecture. Specifically, we build upon the known benefits of knowledge vocalization, parallel learning, and immediate feedback in the context of student learning. We show that open-source data combined with state-of-the-art techniques in deep learning and natural language processing can apply the benefits of these three factors at scale, while still operating at the granularity of individual student needs and recommendations. Additionally, we allow teachers to retain full control of the outputs of the algorithms, and provide student statistics to help better guide classroom discussions towards topics that would benefit from more in-person review and coverage. Our experiments and pilot programs show promising results, and cement our hypothesis that the system is flexible enough to serve a wide variety of purposes in both classroom and classroom-free settings.
