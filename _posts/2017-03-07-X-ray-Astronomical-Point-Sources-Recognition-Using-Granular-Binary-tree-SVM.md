##### Abstract
The study on point sources in astronomical images is of special importance, since most energetic celestial objects in the Universe exhibit a point-like appearance. An approach to recognize the point sources (PS) in the X-ray astronomical images using our newly designed granular binary-tree support vector machine (GBT-SVM) classifier is proposed. First, all potential point sources are located by peak detection on the image. The image and spectral features of these potential point sources are then extracted. Finally, a classifier to recognize the true point sources is build through the extracted features. Experiments and applications of our approach on real X-ray astronomical images are demonstrated. comparisons between our approach and other SVM-based classifiers are also carried out by evaluating the precision and recall rates, which prove that our approach is better and achieves a higher accuracy of around 89%.

对天文图像中的点源的研究具有特殊的重要性，因为宇宙中的大多数高能天体呈现出点状的外观。提出了一种利用我们新设计的粒子二叉树支持向量机（GBT-SVM）分类器识别X射线天文图像点源（PS）的方法。首先，通过图像上的峰值检测来定位所有可能的点源。然后提取这些潜在点源的图像和光谱特征。最后，通过提取的特征来建立识别真实点源的分类器。展示了我们在实际X射线天文图像上的实验和应用。我们的方法和其他基于SVM的分类器之间的比较也通过评估精度和召回率来进行，这证明了我们的方法更好，并且实现了约89％的更高精度。
