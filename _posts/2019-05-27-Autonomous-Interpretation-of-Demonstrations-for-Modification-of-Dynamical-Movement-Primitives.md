##### Abstract
The concept of dynamical movement primitives (DMPs) has become popular for modeling of motion, commonly applied to robots. This paper presents a framework that allows a robot operator to adjust DMPs in an intuitive way. Given a generated trajectory with a faulty last part, the operator can use lead-through programming to demonstrate a corrective trajectory. A modified DMP is formed, based on the first part of the faulty trajectory and the last part of the corrective one. A real-time application is presented and verified experimentally.
