##### Abstract
One of fundamental issues for security robots is to detect and track people in the surroundings. The main problems of this task are real-time constraints, a changing background, varying illumination conditions and a non-rigid shape of the person to be tracked. In this paper, we propose a solution for tracking with a pan-tilt camera and a passive infrared range (PIR) sensor to detect the moving object based on consecutive frame difference. The proposed method is excellent in real-time performance because it requires only a little memory and computation. Experiment results show that this method can detect the moving object such as human efficiently and accurately in non-stationary and complex indoor environment.
