##### Abstract
One of fundamental issues for security robots is to detect and track people in the surroundings. The main problems of this task are real-time constraints, a changing background, varying illumination conditions and a non-rigid shape of the person to be tracked. In this paper, we propose a solution for tracking with a pan-tilt camera and a passive infrared range (PIR) sensor to detect the moving object based on consecutive frame difference. The proposed method is excellent in real-time performance because it requires only a little memory and computation. Experiment results show that this method can detect the moving object such as human efficiently and accurately in non-stationary and complex indoor environment.

安全机器人的基本问题之一是检测和跟踪周围的人。这个任务的主要问题是实时的约束，变化的背景，变化的照明条件和被追踪人的非刚性形状。在本文中，我们提出了一个解决方案，跟踪一个云台和一个被动红外距离（PIR）传感器来检测运动物体的基础上连续的帧差异。所提出的方法具有优异的实时性能，因为它只需要很少的存储器和计算。实验结果表明，该方法能够在非平稳，复杂的室内环境中高效，准确地检测人体等运动物体。
