##### Abstract
We are increasingly surrounded by artificially intelligent technology that takes decisions and executes actions on our behalf. This creates a pressing need for general means to communicate with, instruct and guide artificial agents, with human language the most compelling means for such communication. To achieve this in a scalable fashion, agents must be able to relate language to the world and to actions; that is, their understanding of language must be grounded and embodied. However, learning grounded language is a notoriously challenging problem in artificial intelligence research. Here we present an agent that learns to interpret language in a simulated 3D environment where it is rewarded for the successful execution of written instructions. Trained via a combination of reinforcement and unsupervised learning, and beginning with minimal prior knowledge, the agent learns to relate linguistic symbols to emergent perceptual representations of its physical surroundings and to pertinent sequences of actions. The agent's comprehension of language extends beyond its prior experience, enabling it to apply familiar language to unfamiliar situations and to interpret entirely novel instructions. Moreover, the speed with which this agent learns new words increases as its semantic knowledge grows. This facility for generalising and bootstrapping semantic knowledge indicates the potential of the present approach for reconciling ambiguous natural language with the complexity of the physical world.

##### Abstract (translated by Google)
我们越来越被人为的智能技术所包围，这些技术代表我们做出决定并采取行动。这就迫切需要通用手段来沟通，指导和指导人工代理，用人类语言作为这种交流的最有力手段。为了以可扩展的方式实现这一点，代理商必须能够将语言与世界和行动联系起来;也就是说，他们对语言的理解必须扎根和体现。然而，学习基础语言是人工智能研究中一个众所周知的难题。在这里，我们介绍一个代理人，学习在模拟3D环境中解释语言，在成功执行书面指令的过程中获得奖励。通过强化和无监督学习相结合的训练，从最低限度的先验知识开始，智能体学会将语言符号与其物理环境的出现的感知表征和相关的动作序列联系起来。代理人对语言的理解超越了以前的经验，使其能够将熟悉的语言应用于不熟悉的情况，并完全诠释新颖的说明。而且，这个智能体学习新单词的速度随着语义知识的增长而增加。这种用于概括和引导语义知识的工具表明了现有方法将不明确的自然语言与现实世界的复杂性相协调的潜力。
