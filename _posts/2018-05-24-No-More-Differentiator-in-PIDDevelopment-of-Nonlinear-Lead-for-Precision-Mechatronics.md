##### Abstract
Industrial PID consists of three elements: Lag (integrator), Lead (Differentiator) and Low Pass Filters (LPF). PID being a linear control method is inherently bounded by the waterbed effect due to which there exists a trade-off between precision \&amp; tracking, provided by Lag and LPF on one side and stability \&amp; robustness, provided by Lead on the other side. Nonlinear reset strategies applied in Lag and LPF elements have been very effective in reducing this trade-off. However, there is lack of study in developing a reset Lead element. In this paper, we develop a novel lead element which provides higher precision and stability compared to the linear lead filter and can be used as a replacement for the same. The concept is presented and validated on a Lorentz-actuated nanometer precision stage. Improvements in precision, tracking and bandwidth are shown through two separate designs. Performance is validated in both time and frequency domain to ensure that phase margin achieved on the practical setup matches design theories.

工业PID由三部分组成：滞后（积分器），导联（微分器）和低通滤波器（LPF）。作为线性控制方法的PID本质上受到水床效应的限制，因为它在精度＆amp;由Lag和LPF在一侧提供跟踪，并且稳定性＆amp;鲁棒性，由铅在另一边提供。应用于滞后和LPF元件的非线性复位策略在减少这种折衷方面非常有效。但是，在开发复位引线元件方面缺乏研究。在本文中，我们开发了一种新颖的导线元件，与线性导线过滤器相比，它具有更高的精度和稳定性，并可用作其替代品。该概念在洛伦兹驱动的纳米级精密台上展示和验证。精度，跟踪和带宽的改进通过两个独立的设计展现出来。性能在时域和频域都得到验证，以确保在实际设置中达到的相位裕度与设计理论相匹配。
