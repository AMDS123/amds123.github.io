##### Abstract
Object reconstruction is one of the main problems in cultural heritage preservation. This problem is due to lack of data in documentation. Thus in this research we presented a method of 3D reconstruction using close-range photogrammetry. We collected 1319 photos from five temples in Yogyakarta. Using A-KAZE algorithm, keypoints of each image were obtained. Then we employed LIOP to create feature descriptor from it. After performing feature matching, L1RA was utilized to create sparse point clouds. In order to generate the geometry shape, MVS was used. Finally, FSSR and Large Scale Texturing were employed to deal with the surface and texture of the object. The quality of the reconstructed 3D model was measured by comparing the 3D images of the model with the original photos utilizing SSIM. The results showed that in terms of quality, our method was on par with other commercial method such as PhotoModeler and PhotoScan.

对象重建是保存文化遗产的主要问题之一。这个问题是由于缺少文档中的数据。因此，在这项研究中，我们提出了一种使用近景摄影测量的三维重建方法。我们从日惹五个寺庙收集了1319张照片。使用A-KAZE算法，获得每个图像的关键点。然后我们用LIOP来创建特征描述符。在执行特征匹配之后，利用L1RA来创建稀疏点云。为了生成几何形状，使用了MVS。最后，采用FSSR和大规模纹理来处理物体的表面和纹理。通过使用SSIM将模型的3D图像与原始照片进行比较来测量重建的3D模型的质量。结果表明，在质量方面，我们的方法与其他商业方法，如PhotoModeler和PhotoScan相媲美。
