##### Abstract
In the last years, the Linked Data Cloud has achieved a size of more than 100 billion facts pertaining to a multitude of domains. However, accessing this information has been significantly challenging for lay users. Approaches to problems such as Question Answering on Linked Data and Link Discovery have notably played a role in increasing information access. These approaches are often based on handcrafted and/or statistical models derived from data observation. Recently, Deep Learning architectures based on Neural Networks called seq2seq have shown to achieve state-of-the-art results at translating sequences into sequences. In this direction, we propose Neural SPARQL Machines, end-to-end deep architectures to translate any natural language expression into sentences encoding SPARQL queries. Our preliminary results, restricted on selected DBpedia classes, show that Neural SPARQL Machines are a promising approach for Question Answering on Linked Data, as they can deal with known problems such as vocabulary mismatch and perform graph pattern composition.

在过去的几年中，关联数据云已经实现了1000多亿个与众多领域相关的事实。但是，访问这些信息对于外行用户来说是一个非常大的挑战诸如对关联数据的问题回答和链接发现等问题的处理在增加信息访问方面显着起到了作用。这些方法通常基于从数据观察得出的手工和/或统计模型。最近，基于神经网络的深度学习架构seq2seq已经证明在将序列转换成序列方面取得了最新的成果。在这个方向上，我们提出Neural SPARQL Machines，端到端的深层体系结构，将任何自然语言表达式翻译成编码SPARQL查询的句子。我们的初步结果，限制在选定的DBpedia类，表明神经SPARQL机器是一个有前途的方法对关联数据的问题回答，因为他们可以处理已知的问题，如词汇不匹配和执行图形组成。
