##### Abstract
Recent machine learning techniques can be modified to produce creative results. Those results did not exist before; it is not a trivial combination of the data which was fed into the machine learning system. The obtained results come in multiple forms: As images, as text and as audio. This paper gives a high level overview of how they are created and gives some examples. It is meant to be a summary of the current work and give people who are new to machine learning some starting points.

最近的机器学习技术可以被修改以产生创造性的结果。那些结果以前不存在;这并不是将数据输入到机器学习系统中的简单组合。获得的结果以多种形式出现：作为图像，作为文本和作为音频。本文提供了一个如何创建的高层次的概述，并给出了一些例子。这是对当前工作的总结，给机器学习的新手一些起点。
