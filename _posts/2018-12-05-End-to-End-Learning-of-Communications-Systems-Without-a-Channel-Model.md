##### Abstract
The idea of end-to-end learning of communications systems through neural network -based autoencoders has the shortcoming that it requires a differentiable channel model. We present in this paper a novel learning algorithm which alleviates this problem. The algorithm iterates between supervised training of the receiver and reinforcement learning -based training of the transmitter. We demonstrate that this approach works as well as fully supervised methods on additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) and Rayleigh block-fading (RBF) channels. Surprisingly, while our method converges slower on AWGN channels than supervised training, it converges faster on RBF channels. Our results are a first step towards learning of communications systems over any type of channel without prior assumptions.
