##### Abstract
The widespread use of conversational and question answering systems made it necessary to improve the performances of speaker intent detection and understanding of related semantic slots, i.e., Spoken Language Understanding (SLU). Often, these tasks are approached with supervised learning methods, which needs considerable labeled datasets. This paper presents the first Italian dataset for SLU. It is derived through a semi-automatic procedure and is used as a benchmark of various open source and commercial systems.
