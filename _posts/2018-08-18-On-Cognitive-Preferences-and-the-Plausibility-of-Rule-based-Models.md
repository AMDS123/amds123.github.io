##### Abstract
It is conventional wisdom in machine learning and data mining that logical models such as rule sets are more interpretable than other models, and that among such rule-based models, simpler models are more interpretable than more complex ones. In this position paper, we question this latter assumption by focusing on one particular aspect of interpretability, namely the plausibility of models. Roughly speaking, we equate the plausibility of a model with the likeliness that a user accepts it as an explanation for a prediction. In particular, we argue that, all other things being equal, longer explanations may be more convincing than shorter ones, and that the predominant bias for shorter models, which is typically necessary for learning powerful discriminative models, may not be suitable when it comes to user acceptance of the learned models. To that end, we first recapitulate evidence for and against this postulate, and then report the results of an evaluation in a crowd-sourcing study based on about 3.000 judgments. The results do not reveal a strong preference for simple rules, whereas we can observe a weak preference for longer rules in some domains. We then relate these results to well-known cognitive biases such as the conjunction fallacy, the representative heuristic, or the recogition heuristic, and investigate their relation to rule length and plausibility.

在机器学习和数据挖掘中，传统的智慧是诸如规则集之类的逻辑模型比其他模型更易于解释，并且在这种基于规则的模型中，更简单的模型比更复杂的模型更易于理解。在这份立场文件中，我们通过关注可解释性的一个特定方面，即模型的合理性来质疑后一种假设。粗略地说，我们将模型的合理性与用户接受它作为预测解释的可能性等同起来。特别是，我们认为，在所有其他条件相同的情况下，较长的解释可能比较短的解释更有说服力，而较短模型的主要偏见（通常是学习强大的判别模型所必需的）可能不适用于用户接受学习模型。为此，我们首先概括支持和反对这一假设的证据，然后在基于约3,000条判断的众包研究中报告评估结果。结果并未表明对简单规则的强烈偏好，而我们可以观察到某些领域中较长规则的弱偏好。然后，我们将这些结果与众所周知的认知偏差联系起来，例如连词谬误，代表性启发式或认知启发式，并研究它们与规则长度和合理性的关系。
