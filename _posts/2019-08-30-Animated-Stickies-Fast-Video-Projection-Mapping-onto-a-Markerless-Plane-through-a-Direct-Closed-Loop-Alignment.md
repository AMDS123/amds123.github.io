##### Abstract
This paper presents a fast projection mapping method for moving image content projected onto a markerless planar surface using a low-latency Digital Micromirror Device (DMD) projector. By adopting a closed-loop alignment approach, in which not only the surface texture but also the projected image is tracked by a camera, the proposed method is free from a calibration or position adjustment between the camera and projector. We designed fiducial patterns to be inserted into a fast flapping sequence of binary frames of the DMD projector, which allows the simultaneous tracking of the surface texture and a fiducial geometry separate from a single image captured by the camera. The proposed method implemented on a CPU runs at 400 fps and enables arbitrary video contents to be "stuck" onto a variety of textured surfaces.
