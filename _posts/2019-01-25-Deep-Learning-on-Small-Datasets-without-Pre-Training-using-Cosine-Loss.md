##### Abstract
Two things seem to be indisputable in the contemporary deep learning discourse: 1. The categorical cross-entropy loss after softmax activation is the method of choice for classification. 2. Training a CNN classifier from scratch on small datasets does not work well. In contrast to this, we show that the cosine loss function provides significantly better performance than cross-entropy on datasets with only a handful of samples per class. For example, the accuracy achieved on the CUB-200-2011 dataset without pre-training is by 30% higher than with the cross-entropy loss. Further experiments on four other popular datasets confirm our findings. Moreover, we show that the classification performance can be improved further by integrating prior knowledge in the form of class hierarchies, which is straightforward with the cosine loss.
