##### Abstract
Accurate detection and segmentation of anatomical structures from ultrasound images are crucial for clinical diagnosis and biometric measurements. Although ultrasound imaging has been widely used with superiorities such as low cost and portability, the fuzzy border definition and existence of abounding artifacts pose great challenges for automatically detecting and segmenting the complex anatomical structures. In this paper, we propose a multi-domain regularized deep learning method to address this challenging problem. By leveraging the transfer learning from cross domains, the feature representations are effectively enhanced. The results are further improved by the iterative refinement. Moreover, our method is quite efficient by taking advantage of a fully convolutional network, which is formulated as an end-to-end learning framework of detection and segmentation. Extensive experimental results on a large-scale database corroborated that our method achieved a superior detection and segmentation accuracy, outperforming other methods by a significant margin and demonstrating competitive capability even compared to human performance.

超声图像的解剖结构的准确检测和分割对于临床诊断和生物测量是至关重要的。虽然超声成像已经被广泛应用于低成本和便携性等优势，但模糊边界的定义和大量伪影的存在对于自动检测和分割复杂的解剖结构提出了很大的挑战。在本文中，我们提出了一个多领域的正则化深度学习方法来解决这个具有挑战性的问题。通过利用跨领域的转移学习，特征表示被有效地增强。迭代改进可以进一步改善结果。此外，我们的方法是相当有效的，充分利用完全卷积网络，这是一个端到端的检测和分割学习框架。大规模数据库的广泛的实验结果证实，我们的方法实现了卓越的检测和分割准确性，与其他方法相比，性能明显优于其他方法，并显示出竞争力。
