##### Abstract
We propose a two-agent game wherein a questioner must be able to conjure discerning questions between sentences, incorporate responses from an answerer, and keep track of a hypothesis state. The questioner must be able to understand the information required to make its final guess, while also being able to reason over the game's text environment based on the answerer's responses. We experiment with an end-to-end model where both agents can learn simultaneously to play the game, showing that simultaneously achieving high game accuracy and producing meaningful questions can be a difficult trade-off.
