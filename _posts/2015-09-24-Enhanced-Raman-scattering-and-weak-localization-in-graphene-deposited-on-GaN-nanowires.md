##### Abstract
The influence of GaN nanowires on the optical and electrical properties of graphene deposited on them was studied using Raman spectroscopy and microwave induced electron transport method. It was found that interaction with the nanowires induces spectral changes as well as large enhancement of Raman scattering intensity. Surprisingly, the smallest enhancement (about 30-fold) was observed for the defect induced D' process and the highest intensity increase (over 50-fold) was found for the 2D transition. The observed energy shifts of the G and 2D bands allowed to determine carrier concentration fluctuations induced by GaN nanowires. Comparison of Raman scattering spatial intensity maps and the images obtained using scanning electron microscope led to conclusion that vertically aligned GaN nanowires induce a homogenous strain, substantial spatial modulation of carrier concentration in graphene and unexpected homogenous distribution of defects created by interaction with nanowires. The analysis of the D and D' peak intensity ratio showed that interaction with nanowires also changes the probability of scattering on different types of defects. The Raman studies were correlated with weak localization effect measured using microwave induced contactless electron transport. Temperature dependence of weak localization signal showed electron-electron scattering as a main decoherence mechanism with additional, temperature independent scattering reducing coherence length. We attributed it to the interaction of electrons in graphene with charges present on the top of nanowires due to spontaneous and piezoelectric polarization of GaN. Thus, nanowires act as antennas and generate enhanced near field which can explain the observed large enhancement of Raman scattering intensity.

采用拉曼光谱和微波诱导电子传输方法，研究了GaN纳米线对沉积在其上的石墨烯的光电特性的影响。发现与纳米线的相互作用引起光谱变化以及拉曼散射强度的大幅增强。令人惊讶的是，对于缺陷诱导的D'过程观察到最小的增强（约30倍），并且发现2D过渡的最高强度增加（超过50倍）。所观察到的G和2D带的能量偏移允许确定由GaN纳米线引起的载流子浓度波动。拉曼散射空间强度图和使用扫描电子显微镜获得的图像的比较导致垂直排列的GaN纳米线诱导均匀应变，石墨烯中载流子浓度的实质性空间调制以及与纳米线相互作用产生的意想不到的均匀分布的缺陷。 D和D'峰强度比的分析表明，与纳米线的相互作用也改变了在不同类型的缺陷上散射的可能性。拉曼研究与使用微波诱导的非接触式电子传输测量的弱定位效应相关。弱定位信号的温度依赖性表现为电子 - 电子散射作为主要的退相干机理，具有附加的，温度无关的散射减小相干长度。我们将其归因于石墨烯中的电子与纳米线顶部存在的电荷（由于GaN的自发和压电极化）的相互作用。因此，纳米线充当天线并产生增强的近场，这可以解释观察到的拉曼散射强度的大增强。
