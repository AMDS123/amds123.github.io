##### Abstract
Group recommendation aims to recommend items for a group of users, e.g., recommending a restaurant for a group of colleagues. The group recommendation problem is challenging, in that a good model should understand the group decision making process appropriately: users are likely to follow decisions of only a few users, who are group's leaders or experts. To address this challenge, we propose using an attention mechanism to capture the impact of each user in a group. Specifically, our model learns the influence weight of each user in a group and recommends items to the group based on its members' weighted preferences. Moreover, our model can dynamically adjust the weight of each user across the groups; thus, the model provides a new and flexible method to model the complicated group decision making process, which differentiates us from other existing solutions. Through extensive experiments, it has demonstrated that our model significantly outperforms baseline methods for the group recommendation problem.

群组推荐旨在为一组用户推荐项目，例如，为一组同事推荐餐馆。小组推荐问题具有挑战性，因为良好的模型应该适当地理解小组决策过程：用户可能只关注少数用户的决策，他们是小组的领导者或专家。为了应对这一挑战，我们建议使用注意机制来捕捉每个用户在组中的影响。具体而言，我们的模型了解组中每个用户的影响权重，并根据其成员的加权偏好向组推荐项目。此外，我们的模型可以动态调整各组之间每个用户的权重;因此，该模型为复杂的群体决策过程建模提供了一种新的灵活方法，使我们与其他现有解决方案区别开来。通过大量实验，证明我们的模型明显优于群体推荐问题的基线方法。
