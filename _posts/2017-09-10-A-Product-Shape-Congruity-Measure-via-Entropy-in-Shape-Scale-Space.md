##### Abstract
Product shape is one of the factors that trigger preference decisions of customers. Congruity of shape elements and deformation of shape from the prototype are two factors that are found to influence aesthetic response, hence preference. We propose a measure to indirectly quantify congruity of different parts of the shape and the degree to which the parts deviate from a sphere, i.e. our choice of the prototype, without explicitly defining parts and their relations. The basic signals and systems concept that we use is the entropy. Our measure attains its lowest value for a volume enclosed by a sphere. On one hand, deformations from the prototype cause an increase in the measure. On the other hand, as deformations create congruent parts, our measure decreases due to the attained harmony. Our preliminary experimental results are consistent with our expectations.

产品形态是引发顾客偏好决定的因素之一。从原型的形状元素和形状变形的一致性是影响审美反应的两个因素，因此是偏好。我们提出一种间接量化形状的不同部分的一致性和部分偏离一个范围的程度，即我们对原型的选择，而不明确定义部分及其关系。我们使用的基本信号和系统概念是熵。我们的测量达到了球体所包围体积的最低值。一方面，原型的变形会导致测量的增加。另一方面，由于变形产生了一致的部分，我们的测量由于达到了和谐而下降。我们的初步实验结果与我们的预期一致。
