##### Abstract
The diagnosis of epilepsy generally includes a visual inspection of EEG recorded data by the Neurologist, with the purpose of checking the occurrence of transient waveforms called interictal epileptiform discharges. These waveforms have short duration (less than 100 ms), so the inspection process is usually time-consuming, particularly for ambulatory long term EEG records. Therefore, an automatic detection system of epileptiform discharges can be a valuable tool for a Neurology service. The proposed approach is the development of a multi stage detection algorithm, which processes the complete EEG signals and applies decision criteria to selected waveforms. It employs EEG analysis techniques such as Wavelet Transform and Mimetic Analysis, complemented with a classification based on Fuzzy Logic. In order to evaluate the algorithm's performance, data were collected from several epileptic patients, with epileptiform activity marked by a Neurologist. The average values obtained for both Sensitivity and Specificity were respectively higher than 80 and 70 percent.

癫痫的诊断一般包括由神经科医师对脑电图记录的数据进行视觉检查，目的是检查称为发作间癫痫样放电的瞬时波形的发生。这些波形持续时间短（小于100毫秒），因此检查过程通常是耗时的，尤其是对于长期的脑电图记录。因此，癫痫样放电的自动检测系统可以成为神经科服务的有价值的工具。所提出的方法是开发多阶段检测算法，其处理完整的EEG信号并将决策标准应用于所选择的波形。它采用EEG分析技术，如小波变换和仿真分析，辅以基于模糊逻辑的分类。为了评估算法的性能，收集来自几个癫痫患者的数据，癫痫样活动由神经科医师标记。敏感性和特异性的平均值分别高于80％和70％。
