##### Abstract
We describe a software toolbox for the configuration of deep neural networks in the domain of skin cancer classification. The implemented software architecture allows developers to quickly set up new convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures and hyper-parameter configurations. At the same time, the user interface, manageable as a simple spreadsheet, allows non-technical users to explore different configuration settings that need to be explored when switching to different data sets. In future versions, meta leaning frameworks can be added, or AutoML systems that continuously improve over time. Preliminary results, conducted with two CNNs in the context melanoma detection on dermoscopic images, quantify the impact of image augmentation, image resolution, and rescaling filter on the overall detection performance and training time.
