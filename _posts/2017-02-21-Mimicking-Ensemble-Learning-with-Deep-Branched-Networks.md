##### Abstract
This paper proposes a branched residual network for image classification. It is known that high-level features of deep neural network are more representative than lower-level features. By sharing the low-level features, the network can allocate more memory to high-level features. The upper layers of our proposed network are branched, so that it mimics the ensemble learning. By mimicking ensemble learning with single network, we have achieved better performance on ImageNet classification task.

##### Abstract (translated by Google)
本文提出了一种图像分类的分支残差网络。众所周知，深层神经网络的高层特征比低层特征更具代表性。通过共享低级功能，网络可以为高级功能分配更多的内存。我们提出的网络的上层是分支的，所以它模仿集合学习。通过模拟单一网络的集成学习，我们在ImageNet分类任务上取得了较好的性能。
