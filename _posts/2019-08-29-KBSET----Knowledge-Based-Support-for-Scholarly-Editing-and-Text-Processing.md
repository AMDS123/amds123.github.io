##### Abstract
KBSET supports a practical workflow for scholarly editing, based on using LaTeX with dedicated commands for semantics-oriented markup and a Prolog-implemented core system. Prolog plays there various roles: as query language and access mechanism for large Semantic Web fact bases, as data representation of structured documents and as a workflow model for advanced application tasks. The core system includes a LaTeX parser and a facility for the identification of named entities. We also sketch future perspectives of this approach to scholarly editing based on techniques of computational logic.
