##### Abstract
We propose a framework to improve performance of distantly-supervised relation extraction, by jointly learning to solve two related tasks: concept-instance extraction and relation extraction. We combine this with a novel use of document structure: in some small, well-structured corpora, sections can be identified that correspond to relation arguments, and distantly-labeled examples from such sections tend to have good precision. Using these as seeds we extract additional relation examples by applying label propagation on a graph composed of noisy examples extracted from a large unstructured testing corpus. Combined with the soft constraint that concept examples should have the same type as the second argument of the relation, we get significant improvements over several state-of-the-art approaches to distantly-supervised relation extraction.

##### Abstract (translated by Google)
通过联合学习解决两个相关的任务：概念实例提取和关系提取，我们提出了一个改善远程监督关系抽取性能的框架。我们将这与文档结构的一种新颖使用结合起来：在一些小的，结构良好的语料库中，可以识别与关系论点相对应的部分，并且来自这些部分的远离标记的例子往往具有良好的精度。使用这些作为种子，我们通过在从大型非结构化测试语料库提取的噪声示例组成的图上应用标签传播来提取另外的关系示例。结合概念例子应该与关系的第二个参数具有相同类型的软约束，我们对远程监督关系抽取的几种最新方法进行了重大的改进。
