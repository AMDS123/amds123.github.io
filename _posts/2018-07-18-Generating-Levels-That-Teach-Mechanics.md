##### Abstract
The automatic generation of game tutorials is a challenging AI problem. While it is possible to generate annotations and instructions that explain to the player how the game is played, this paper focuses on generating a gameplay experience that introduces the player to a game mechanic. It evolves small levels for the Mario AI Framework that can only be beaten by an agent that knows how to perform specific actions in the game. It uses variations of a perfect A* agent that are limited in various ways, such as not being able to jump high or see enemies, to test how failing to do certain actions can stop the player from beating the level.

自动生成游戏教程是一个具有挑战性的AI问题。虽然可以生成注释和说明，向玩家解释游戏的播放方式，但本文着重于生成将玩家引入游戏机制的游戏体验。它为Mario AI Framework提供了一个小级别，只有知道如何在游戏中执行特定操作的代理才能打败它。它使用完美A *代理的变体，以各种方式受限，例如无法跳高或看敌人，测试未能做某些动作可以阻止玩家击败关卡。
