##### Abstract
Stack-based high dynamic range (HDR) imaging is a technique for achieving a larger dynamic range in an image by combining several low dynamic range images acquired at different exposures. Minimizing the set of images to combine, while ensuring that the resulting HDR image fully captures the scene's irradiance, is important to avoid long image acquisition and post-processing times. The problem of selecting the set of images has received much attention. However, existing methods either are not fully automatic, can be slow, or can fail to fully capture more challenging scenes. In this paper, we propose a fully automatic method for selecting the set of exposures to acquire that is both fast and more accurate. We show on an extensive set of benchmark scenes that our proposed method leads to improved HDR images as measured against ground truth using the mean squared error, a pixel-based metric, and a visible difference predictor and a quality score, both perception-based metrics.

基于堆栈的高动态范围（HDR）成像是一种通过组合在不同曝光时获得的多个低动态范围图像来实现图像中较大动态范围的技术。尽量减少要组合的图像，同时确保生成的HDR图像完全捕捉场景的辐照度，这对于避免长时间的图像采集和后期处理非常重要。选择这组图像的问题受到了很多关注。但是，现有的方法要么不是全自动的，要么很慢，要么无法完全捕捉到更具挑战性的场景。在本文中，我们提出了一种全自动方法，用于选择既快速又准确的采集曝光集。我们展示了大量的基准场景，我们提出的方法可以使用均方差，基于像素的度量以及可见的差异预测和质量得分（基于感知的度量）来测量地面真实度，从而改善HDR图像。
