##### Abstract
Meteorologists use shapes and movements of clouds in satellite images as indicators of several major types of severe storms. Satellite imaginary data are in increasingly higher resolution, both spatially and temporally, making it impossible for humans to fully leverage the data in their forecast. Automatic satellite imagery analysis methods that can find storm-related cloud patterns as soon as they are detectable are in demand. We propose a machine learning and pattern recognition based approach to detect "comma-shaped" clouds in satellite images, which are specific cloud distribution patterns strongly associated with the cyclone formulation. In order to detect regions with the targeted movement patterns, our method is trained on manually annotated cloud examples represented by both shape and motion-sensitive features. Sliding windows in different scales are used to ensure that dense clouds will be captured, and we implement effective selection rules to shrink the region of interest among these sliding windows. Finally, we evaluate the method on a hold-out annotated comma-shaped cloud dataset and cross-match the results with recorded storm events in the severe weather database. The validated utility and accuracy of our method suggest a high potential for assisting meteorologists in weather forecasting.

气象学家利用卫星图像中云的形状和运动作为几种主要类型的严重风暴的指标。卫星虚拟数据的空间和时间分辨率越来越高，因此人类不可能在预测中充分利用数据。自动卫星图像分析方法可以在发现风暴相关云图时尽快找到。我们提出了一种基于机器学习和模式识别的方法来检测卫星图像中的“逗号形”云，这是与旋风配方强烈相关的特定云分布模式。为了检测具有目标运动模式的区域，我们的方法通过手动注释的云示例进行训练，这些云示例由形状和运动敏感特征表示。使用不同比例的滑动窗口来确保捕捉密集的云，并且我们实施有效的选择规则以缩小这些滑动窗口中的感兴趣区域。最后，我们在持有注释的逗号形云数据集上评估该方法，并将结果与​​恶劣天气数据库中记录的风暴事件进行交叉匹配。我们方法验证的效用和准确性表明协助气象学家进行天气预报的潜力很大。
