##### Abstract
We present a mathematical model for geometric deep learning based upon a scattering transform defined over manifolds, which generalizes the wavelet scattering transform of Mallat. This geometric scattering transform is (locally) invariant to isometry group actions, and we conjecture that it is stable to actions of the diffeomorphism group.
