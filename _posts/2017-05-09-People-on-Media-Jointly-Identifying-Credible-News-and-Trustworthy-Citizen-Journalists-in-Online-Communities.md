##### Abstract
Media seems to have become more partisan, often providing a biased coverage of news catering to the interest of specific groups. It is therefore essential to identify credible information content that provides an objective narrative of an event. News communities such as digg, reddit, or newstrust offer recommendations, reviews, quality ratings, and further insights on journalistic works. However, there is a complex interaction between different factors in such online communities: fairness and style of reporting, language clarity and objectivity, topical perspectives (like political viewpoint), expertise and bias of community members, and more. This paper presents a model to systematically analyze the different interactions in a news community between users, news, and sources. We develop a probabilistic graphical model that leverages this joint interaction to identify 1) highly credible news articles, 2) trustworthy news sources, and 3) expert users who perform the role of "citizen journalists" in the community. Our method extends CRF models to incorporate real-valued ratings, as some communities have very fine-grained scales that cannot be easily discretized without losing information. To the best of our knowledge, this paper is the first full-fledged analysis of credibility, trust, and expertise in news communities.

媒体似乎已经变得更加党派化，通常会提供一个有针对性的新闻报道来满足特定群体的兴趣。因此，确定可信的信息内容是事件客观的叙述。 digg，reddit或者newstrust等新闻社区提供了新闻报道的建议，评论，质量评分和进一步的见解。然而，网络社区的不同因素之间存在着复杂的互动关系：报道的公平性和风格，语言的清晰性和客观性，专题观点（如政治观点），社区成员的专业性和偏见等等。本文提出了一个模型来系统地分析新闻社区中用户，新闻和来源之间的不同交互。我们开发了一个概率图模型，利用这种联合互动来识别1）高度可信的新闻文章，2）值得信赖的新闻来源，3）在社区中扮演“公民记者”角色的专家用户。我们的方法扩展了CRF模型以合并实值评级，因为一些社区具有非常细的尺度，不能在不丢失信息的情况下容易地离散化。据我们所知，这篇论文是对新闻社区的信誉，信任和专业知识的第一次全面的分析。
