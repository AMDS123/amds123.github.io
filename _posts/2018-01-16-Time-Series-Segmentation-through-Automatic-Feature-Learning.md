##### Abstract
Internet of things (IoT) applications have become increasingly popular in recent years, with applications ranging from building energy monitoring to personal health tracking and activity recognition. In order to leverage these data, automatic knowledge extraction - whereby we map from observations to interpretable states and transitions - must be done at scale. As such, we have seen many recent IoT data sets include annotations with a human expert specifying states, recorded as a set of boundaries and associated labels in a data sequence. These data can be used to build automatic labeling algorithms that produce labels as an expert would. Here, we refer to human-specified boundaries as breakpoints. Traditional changepoint detection methods only look for statistically-detectable boundaries that are defined as abrupt variations in the generative parameters of a data sequence. However, we observe that breakpoints occur on more subtle boundaries that are non-trivial to detect with these statistical methods. In this work, we propose a new unsupervised approach, based on deep learning, that outperforms existing techniques and learns the more subtle, breakpoint boundaries with a high accuracy. Through extensive experiments on various real-world data sets - including human-activity sensing data, speech signals, and electroencephalogram (EEG) activity traces - we demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithm for practical applications. Furthermore, we show that our approach achieves significantly better performance than previous methods.

物联网（IoT）应用程序近年来越来越流行，其应用范围从构建能源监控到个人健康跟踪和活动识别。为了利用这些数据，自动提取知识 - 从观察到可解释的状态和过渡 - 必须按比例进行。因此，我们已经看到很多最近的物联网数据集都包含一个人类专家指定状态的注释，记录为数据序列中的一组边界和相关标签。这些数据可以用来构建标签自动生成算法，可以像专家一样生成标签。在这里，我们将人类指定的边界称为断点。传统的转换点检测方法只能查找统计上可检测的边界，这些边界被定义为数据序列的生成参数的突变。然而，我们观察到断点出现在更微妙的边界上，这些统计方法并不是无关紧要的。在这项工作中，我们提出了一种新的基于深度学习的无监督方法，其优于现有的技术，并以较高的精度学习更微妙的断点边界。通过对各种真实世界的数据集（包括人类活动传感数据，语音信号和脑电图（EEG）活动追踪）进行广泛的实验，我们证明了我们算法在实际应用中的有效性。此外，我们表明，我们的方法实现了比以前的方法显着更好的性能。
