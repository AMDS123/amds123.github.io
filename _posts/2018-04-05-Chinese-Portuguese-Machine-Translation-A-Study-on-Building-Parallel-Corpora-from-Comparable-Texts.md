##### Abstract
Although there are increasing and significant ties between China and Portuguese-speaking countries, there is not much parallel corpora in the Chinese-Portuguese language pair. Both languages are very populous, with 1.2 billion native Chinese speakers and 279 million native Portuguese speakers, the language pair, however, could be considered as low-resource in terms of available parallel corpora. In this paper, we describe our methods to curate Chinese-Portuguese parallel corpora and evaluate their quality. We extracted bilingual data from Macao government websites and proposed a hierarchical strategy to build a large parallel corpus. Experiments are conducted on existing and our corpora using both Phrased-Based Machine Translation (PBMT) and the state-of-the-art Neural Machine Translation (NMT) models. The results of this work can be used as a benchmark for future Chinese-Portuguese MT systems. The approach we used in this paper also shows a good example on how to boost performance of MT systems for low-resource language pairs.

尽管中国与葡语国家之间的联系日益密切，但中葡语言对中并没有太多平行的语料库。这两种语言都非常人口众多，有12亿中国母语人士和2.79亿印度本土语言人士，但是，语言对可以被视为低可用平行语料库。在本文中，我们描述了我们策划中葡并列语料库并评估其质量的方法。我们从澳门政府网站提取双语数据，并提出了构建大型平行语料库的分层策略。使用基于Phrased的机器翻译（PBMT）和先进的神经机器翻译（NMT）模型对现有和我们的语料库进行实验。这项工作的结果可以作为未来中国 - 葡萄牙语MT系统的基准。我们在本文中使用的方法也展示了一个很好的例子，就如何提高低资源语言对MT系统的性能。
