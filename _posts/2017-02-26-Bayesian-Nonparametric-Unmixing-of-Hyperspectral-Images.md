##### Abstract
Hyperspectral imaging is an important tool in remote sensing, allowing for accurate analysis of vast areas. Due to a low spatial resolution, a pixel of a hyperspectral image rarely represents a single material, but rather a mixture of different spectra. HSU aims at estimating the pure spectra present in the scene of interest, referred to as endmembers, and their fractions in each pixel, referred to as abundances. Today, many HSU algorithms have been proposed, based either on a geometrical or statistical model. While most methods assume that the number of endmembers present in the scene is known, there is only little work about estimating this number from the observed data. In this work, we propose a Bayesian nonparametric framework that jointly estimates the number of endmembers, the endmembers itself, and their abundances, by making use of the Indian Buffet Process as a prior for the endmembers. Simulation results and experiments on real data demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm, yielding results comparable with state-of-the-art methods while being able to reliably infer the number of endmembers. In scenarios with strong noise, where other algorithms provide only poor results, the proposed approach tends to overestimate the number of endmembers slightly. The additional endmembers, however, often simply represent noisy replicas of present endmembers and could easily be merged in a post-processing step.

高光谱成像是遥感的重要工具，可以对大面积地区进行精确分析。由于空间分辨率低，高光谱图像的像素很少表示单一材料，而是不同光谱的混合。 HSU旨在估计目标场景中存在的纯光谱（称为端元）及其在每个像素中的分数，称为丰度。今天，许多HSU算法已经被提出，基于几何或统计模型。尽管大多数方法都假定场景中存在的成员数目是已知的，但从观察的数据中估计这个数字只有很少的工作。在这项工作中，我们提出了一个贝叶斯非参数框架，通过将印度自助餐流程作为最终成员的先行方法来共同估计成员的数量，成员本身的数量及其丰度。仿真结果和对实际数据的实验证明了所提出的算法的有效性，产生与现有技术方法相当的结果，同时能够可靠地推断端部数量。在噪声较强的情况下，其他算法只能提供较差的结果，所提出的方法往往会略微高估端元数量。然而，额外的成员往往只是简单地代表当前成员的嘈杂复制品，并且可以很容易地在后处理步骤中合并。
