##### Abstract
Objective: Improve the reconstructed image with fast and multi-class dictionaries learning when magnetic resonance imaging is accelerated by undersampling the k-space data. Methods: A fast orthogonal dictionary learning method is introduced into magnetic resonance image reconstruction to providing adaptive sparse representation of images. To enhance the sparsity, image is divided into classified patches according to the same geometrical direction and dictionary is trained within each class. A new sparse reconstruction model with the multi-class dictionaries is proposed and solved using a fast alternating direction method of multipliers. Results: Experiments on phantom and brain imaging data with acceleration factor up to 10 and various undersampling patterns are conducted. The proposed method is compared with state-of-the-art magnetic resonance image reconstruction methods. Conclusion: Artifacts are better suppressed and image edges are better preserved than the compared methods. Besides, the computation of the proposed approach is much faster than the typical K-SVD dictionary learning method in magnetic resonance image reconstruction. Significance: The proposed method can be exploited in undersapmled magnetic resonance imaging to reduce data acquisition time and reconstruct images with better image quality.

目的：通过对K空间数据进行欠采样来加速磁共振成像，从而提高重建图像的速度和多级词典学习速度。方法：在磁共振图像重建中引入快速正交字典学习方法，提供图像的自适应稀疏表示。为了增强稀疏性，将图像按照相同的几何方向划分为分类的片，并在每个类中训练字典。提出了一种新的多类字典稀疏重构模型，并利用乘法器快速交替方向法求解。结果：对加速因子高达10的幻像和脑部成像数据和各种欠采样模式进行实验。所提出的方法与现有技术的磁共振图像重建方法进行比较。结论：伪像比被比较的方法抑制得更好，图像边缘保留得更好。此外，所提出的方法的计算速度比磁共振图像重建中典型的K-SVD字典学习方法快得多。意义：所提出的方法可用于低位磁共振成像，以减少数据采集时间和重建图像质量更好的图像。
