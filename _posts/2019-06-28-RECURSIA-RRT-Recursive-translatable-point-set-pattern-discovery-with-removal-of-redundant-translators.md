##### Abstract
Two algorithms, RECURSIA and RRT, are presented, designed to increase the compression factor achieved using SIATEC-based point-set cover algorithms. RECURSIA recursively applies a TEC cover algorithm to the patterns in the TECs that it discovers. RRT attempts to remove translators from each TEC without reducing its covered set. When evaluated with COSIATEC, SIATECCompress and Forth's algorithm on the JKU Patterns Development Database, using RECURSIA with or without RRT increased compression factor and recall but reduced precision. Using RRT alone increased compression factor and reduced recall and precision, but had a smaller effect than RECURSIA.
