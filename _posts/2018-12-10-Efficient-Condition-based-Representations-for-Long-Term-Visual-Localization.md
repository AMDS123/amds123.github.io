##### Abstract
We propose an approach to localization from images that is designed to explicitly handle the strong variations in appearance happening when capturing conditions change throughout the day or across seasons. As revealed by recent long-term localization benchmarks, both traditional feature-based and retrieval-based approaches still struggle to handle such changes. Our novel retrieval-based method introduces condition-specific sub-networks allowing the computation of global image descriptors that are explicitly dependent of the capturing conditions. We compare our approach to previous localization methods on very recent challenging benchmarks, and observe that our method outperforms them by a large margin in case of day-night variation, where repeatable feature points cannot be identified or matched.
