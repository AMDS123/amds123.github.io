##### Abstract
Accurate identification and localization of abnormalities from radiology images play an integral part in clinical diagnosis and treatment planning. Building a highly accurate prediction model for these tasks usually requires a large number of images manually annotated with labels and finding sites of abnormalities. In reality, however, such annotated data are expensive to acquire, especially the ones with location annotations. We need methods that can work well with only a small amount of location annotations. To address this challenge, we present a unified approach that simultaneously performs disease identification and localization through the same underlying model for all images. We demonstrate that our approach can effectively leverage both class information as well as limited location annotation, and significantly outperforms the comparative reference baseline in both classification and localization tasks.

准确识别和定位放射学图像中的异常是临床诊断和治疗计划中不可或缺的一部分。为这些任务建立高度准确的预测模型通常需要大量的用标签手动注释的图像并找到异常的位置。然而实际上，这样的注释数据是昂贵的，特别是具有位置注释的数据。我们需要的方法只能使用少量的位置注释。为了应对这一挑战，我们提出了一个统一的方法，通过所有图像的相同基础模型同时进行疾病识别和定位。我们证明，我们的方法可以有效地利用类信息以及有限的位置注释，并且在分类和本地化任务中明显优于比较参考基线。
