##### Abstract
Pitch accent detection often makes use of both acoustic and lexical features based on the fact that pitch accents tend to correlate with certain words. In this paper, we extend a pitch accent detector that involves a convolutional neural network to include word embeddings, which are state-of-the-art vector representations of words. We examine the effect these features have on within-corpus and cross-corpus experiments on three English datasets. The results show that while word embeddings can improve the performance in corpus-dependent experiments, they also have the potential to make generalization to unseen data more challenging.

音高重音检测通常基于音高重音倾向于与某些词语相关的事实使用声学和词汇特征。在本文中，我们扩展了包含卷积神经网络的音高重音检测器，以包括词语嵌入，这些词语是语言的最新矢量表示。我们检查这些特征对三个英语数据集的语料库和跨语料库实验的影响。结果表明，尽管文字嵌入可以提高语料库相关实验的性能，但它们也有可能使看不见的数据泛化更具挑战性。
