##### Abstract
Action recognition is a critical task for social robots to meaningfully engage with their environment. 3D human skeleton-based action recognition is an attractive research area in recent years. Although, the existing approaches are good at action recognition, it is a great challenge to recognize a group of actions in an activity scene. To tackle this problem, at first, we partition the scene into several primitive actions (PAs) based upon motion attention mechanism. Then, the primitive actions are described by the trajectory vectors of corresponding joints. After that, motivated by text classification based on word embedding, we employ convolution neural network (CNN) to recognize activity scenes by considering motion of joints as "word" of activity. The experimental results on the scenes of human activity dataset show the efficiency of the proposed approach.

行为识别是社交机器人与环境有意义接触的关键任务。基于3D人体骨骼的动作识别是近年来颇具吸引力的研究领域。虽然现有的方法擅长动作识别，但在活动场景中识别一组动作是一项巨大的挑战。为了解决这个问题，我们首先根据动作关注机制将场景划分为几个原始动作（PA）。然后，原始动作由相应关节的轨迹向量描述。之后，受基于词嵌入的文本分类的启发，我们使用卷积神经网络（CNN）通过将关节的运动视为活动的“词”来识别活动场景。人类活动数据集场景的实验结果表明了该方法的有效性。
