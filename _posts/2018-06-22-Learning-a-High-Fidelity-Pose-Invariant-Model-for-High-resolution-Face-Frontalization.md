##### Abstract
Face frontalization refers to the process of synthesizing the frontal view of a face from a given profile. Due to self-occlusion and appearance distortion in the wild, it is extremely challenging to recover faithful results and preserve texture details in a high-resolution. This paper proposes a High Fidelity Pose Invariant Model (HF-PIM) to produce photographic and identity-preserving results. HF-PIM frontalizes the profiles through a novel texture fusion warping procedure and leverages a dense correspondence field to bind the 2D and 3D surface space. We decompose the prerequisite of warping into correspondence field estimation and facial texture recovering, which are both well addressed by deep networks. Different from those reconstruction methods relying on 3D data, we also propose Adversarial Residual Dictionary Learning (ARDL) to supervise facial texture map recovering with only monocular images. Exhaustive experiments on both controlled and uncontrolled environments demonstrate that the proposed method not only boosts the performance of pose-invariant face recognition but also dramatically improves high-resolution frontalization appearances.

脸部正面化是指从给定的配置文件合成脸部的正面视图的过程。由于野外自闭症和外观失真，恢复忠实的结果并以高分辨率保存纹理细节极具挑战性。本文提出了高保真姿态不变模型（HF-PIM）来产生照相和身份保持结果。 HF-PIM通过新颖的纹理融合翘曲过程对剖面进行前置处理，并利用密集的对应场来绑定2D和3D表面空间。我们将翘曲的前提分解为对应的场估计和面部纹理恢复，这些都是深层网络很好解决的问题。与那些依赖于三维数据的重建方法不同，我们还提出了敌对残留字典学习（ARDL）来监督仅使用单眼图像恢复面部纹理图。在受控和非受控环境下的详尽实验表明，所提出的方法不仅提高了姿态不变人脸识别的性能，而且还显着提高了高分辨率的正面化外观。
