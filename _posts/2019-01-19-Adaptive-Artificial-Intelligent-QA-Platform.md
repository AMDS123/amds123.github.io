##### Abstract
The paper presents an approach to build a question and answer system that is capable of processing the information in a large dataset and allows the user to gain knowledge from this dataset by asking questions in natural language form. Key content of this research covers four dimensions which are; Corpus Preprocessing, Question Preprocessing, Deep Neural Network for Answer Extraction and Answer Generation. The system is capable of understanding the question, responds to the user's query in natural language form as well. The goal is to make the user feel as if they were interacting with a person than a machine.
