##### Abstract
Train Pilot is a very tedious and stressful job. Pilots must be vigilant at all times and its easy for them to lose track of time of shift. In countries like USA the pilots are mandated by law to adhere to 8 hour shifts. If they exceed 8 hours of shift the railroads may be penalized for over-tiring their drivers. The problem happens when the 8 hour shift may end in middle of a journey. In such case, the new drivers must be moved to the location locomotive is operating for shift change. Hence accurate monitoring of drivers during their shift and making sure the shifts are scheduled correctly is very important for railroads. Here we propose an automated camera system that uses camera mounted inside Locomotive cabs to continuously record video feeds. These feeds are analyzed in real time to detect the face of driver and recognize the driver using state of the art deep Learning techniques. The outcome is an increased safety of train pilots. Cameras continuously capture video from inside the cab which is stored on an on board data acquisition device. Using advanced computer vision and deep learning techniques the videos are analyzed at regular intervals to detect presence of the pilot and identify the pilot. Using a time based analysis, it is identified for how long that shift has been active. If this time exceeds allocated shift time an alert is sent to the dispatch to adjust shift hours.

培训试点是一个非常繁琐和压力大的工作。飞行员必须始终保持警惕，并且容易让他们忘记轮班时间。在像美国这样的国家，飞行员依法要求坚持8小时轮班。如果他们超过8小时的班次，铁路可能会因为驾驶员过度疲劳而受到惩罚。 8小时班次可能会在旅途中结束时，会发生问题。在这种情况下，新的司机必须移动到位置机车正在换班。因此，准确地监控驾驶员在换班期间的工作，并确保正确安排换班对于铁路来说非常重要。在这里，我们提出一个自动化的相机系统，它使用安装在机车内部的摄像机连续记录视频信号。实时分析这些馈送，以检测驾驶员的面部并使用最先进的深度学习技术识别驾驶员。结果是提高了火车飞行员的安全性。摄像机不断地从车载数据采集设备上存储的驾驶室内采集视频。使用先进的计算机视觉和深度学习技术，定期分析视频以检测飞行员的存在并识别飞行员。使用基于时间的分析，确定这种转变已经进行了多久。如果此时间超过了分配的班次时间，则会向调度发送警报以调整班次时间。
