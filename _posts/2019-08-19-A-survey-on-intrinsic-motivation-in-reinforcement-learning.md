##### Abstract
Despite numerous research work in reinforcement learning (RL) and the recent successes obtained by combining it with deep learning, deep reinforcement learning (DRL) is still facing many challenges. Some of them, like the ability to abstract actions or the difficulty to explore the environment with sparse rewards, can be addressed by the use of intrinsic motivation. In this article, we provide a survey on the role of intrinsic motivation in DRL. We categorize the different kinds of intrinsic motivations and detail their interests and limitations. Our investigation shows that the combination of DRL and intrinsic motivation enables to learn more complicated and more generalisable behaviours than standard DRL. We provide an in-depth analysis describing learning modules through an unifying scheme composed of information theory, compression theory and reinforcement learning. We then explain how these modules could serve as building blocks over a complete developmental architecture, highlighting the numerous outlooks of the domain.
