##### Abstract
This paper presents the accessibility and small-time local controllability (STLC) results for $N$-link horizontal planar manipulators with only one unactuated joint. STLC is important in controls, both for design considerations and because large and swinging maneuvers may be avoided for close reconfiguration if a system is STLC. Despite the fact that controllability of underactuated horizontal planar manipulators has been extensively studied, most work focused only on three-link and global controllability. This paper thus has two contributions: 1) using Lie brackets to study the accessibility and STLC for underactuated two-link manipulators with different actuator configurations, and illustrating the results from a perspective of system dynamics, 2) obtaining the accessibility and STLC results for $N$-link manipulators with one unactuated joint by considering realistic models and different actuator configurations. It is found that an $N$-link ($N\geq 3$) with the first joint actuated is STLC for a subset of equilibrium points based on Sussmann's general theorem for STLC. Moreover, with the dynamics of $N$-link considered in the controllability analysis, it gives relatively simple forms for the nontrivial vector fields, which make it easy to determine at which configurations a model loses full rank condition for accessibility.
