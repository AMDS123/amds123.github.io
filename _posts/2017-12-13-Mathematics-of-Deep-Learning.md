##### Abstract
Recently there has been a dramatic increase in the performance of recognition systems due to the introduction of deep architectures for representation learning and classification. However, the mathematical reasons for this success remain elusive. This tutorial will review recent work that aims to provide a mathematical justification for several properties of deep networks, such as global optimality, geometric stability, and invariance of the learned representations.

##### Abstract (translated by Google)
最近，由于引入了用于表示学习和分类的深层架构，识别系统的性能显着提高。然而，这个成功的数学原因仍然难以捉摸。本教程将回顾最近的工作，旨在为深度网络的几个属性（如全局最优性，几何稳定性和学习表示的不变性）提供数学证明。
