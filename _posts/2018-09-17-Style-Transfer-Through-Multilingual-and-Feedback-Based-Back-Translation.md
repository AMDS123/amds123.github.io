##### Abstract
Style transfer is the task of transferring an attribute of a sentence (e.g., formality) while maintaining its semantic content. The key challenge in style transfer is to strike a balance between the competing goals, one to preserve meaning and the other to improve the style transfer accuracy. Prior research has identified that the task of meaning preservation is generally harder to attain and evaluate. This paper proposes two extensions of the state-of-the-art style transfer models aiming at improving the meaning preservation in style transfer. Our evaluation shows that these extensions help to ground meaning better while improving the transfer accuracy.

样式转移是在保持其语义内容的同时转移句子的属性（例如，形式）的任务。风格转移的关键挑战是在竞争目标之间取得平衡，一个是保持意义，另一个是为了提高风格转移的准确性。之前的研究已经确定意义保存的任务通常难以实现和评估。本文提出了两种最先进的风格转移模型的扩展，旨在提高风格转移中的意义保存。我们的评估表明，这些扩展有助于在提高传输准确性的同时更好地实现意义。
