##### Abstract
The launch of KALPANA-1 satellite in the year 2002 heralded the establishment of an indigenous operational payload for meteorological predictions. This was further enhanced in the year 2003 with the launching of INSAT-3A satellite. The software for generating products from the data of these two satellites was taken up subsequently in the year 2004 and the same was installed at the Indian Meteorological Department, New Delhi in January 2006. Registration has been one of the most fundamental operations to generate almost all the data products from the remotely sensed data. Registration is a challenging task due to inevitable radiometric and geometric distortions during the acquisition process. Besides the presence of clouds makes the problem more complicated. In this paper, we present an algorithm for multitemporal and multiband registration. In addition, India facing reference boundaries for the CCD data of INSAT-3A have also been generated. The complete implementation is made up of the following steps: 1) automatic identification of the ground control points (GCPs) in the sensed data, 2) finding the optimal transformation model based on the match-points, and 3) resampling the transformed imagery to the reference coordinates. The proposed algorithm is demonstrated using the real datasets from KALPANA-1 and INSAT-3A. Both KALAPANA-1 and INSAT-3A have recently been decommissioned due to lack of fuel, however, the experience gained from them have given rise to a series of meteorological satellites and associated software; like INSAT-3D series which give continuous weather forecasting for the country. This paper is not so much focused on the theory (widely available in the literature) but concentrates on the implementation of operational software.

KALPANA-1卫星于2002年发射，预示着为气象预测建立本地业务有效载荷。随着INSAT-3A卫星的发射，这在2003年得到进一步加强。根据这两颗卫星的数据生成产品的软件随后在2004年被采用，2006年1月在印度新德里气象部门也安装了该软件。注册一直是产生几乎所有人的最基本的操作之一来自遥感数据的数据产品。由于采集过程中不可避免的辐射测量和几何失真，注册是一项具有挑战性的任务。除了云的存在使问题更加复杂。在本文中，我们提出了一种用于多时频和多频带配准的算法。另外，面对INSAT-3A的CCD数据的参考边界也已经产生。完成实施由以下步骤组成：1）自动识别感测数据中的地面控制点（GCP），2）基于匹配点找到最佳转换模型，以及3）将转换后的图像重新采样为参考坐标。该算法使用KALPANA-1和INSAT-3A的真实数据集进行演示。 KALAPANA-1和INSAT-3A由于缺乏燃料而最近退役，但从中获得的经验已经产生了一系列气象卫星和相关软件;如INSAT-3D系列，可以为该国提供连续的天气预报。本文并不太关注理论（在文献中广泛提供），而是专注于实施操作软件。
