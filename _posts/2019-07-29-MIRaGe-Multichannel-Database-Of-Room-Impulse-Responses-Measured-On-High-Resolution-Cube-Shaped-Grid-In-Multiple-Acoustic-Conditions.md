##### Abstract
We introduce a database of multi-channel recordings performed in an acoustic lab with adjustable reverberation time. The recordings provide information about room impulse responses (RIR) for various positions of a loudspeaker. In particular, the main positions correspond to 4104 vertices of a cube-shaped dense grid within a 46x36x32 cm volume. The database thus provides a tool for detailed analyses of beampatterns of spatial processing methods as well as for training and testing of mathematical models of the acoustic field.
