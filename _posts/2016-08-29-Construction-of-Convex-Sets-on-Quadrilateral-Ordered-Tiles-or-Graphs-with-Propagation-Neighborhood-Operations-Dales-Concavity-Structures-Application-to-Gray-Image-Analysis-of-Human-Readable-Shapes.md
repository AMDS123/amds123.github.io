##### Abstract
An effort has been made to show mathematicians some new ideas applied to image analysis. Gray images are presented as tilings. Based on topological properties of the tiling, a number of gray convex hulls: maximal, minimal, and oriented ones are constructed and some are proved. They are constructed with only one operation. Two tilings are used in the Constraint and Allowance types of operations. New type of concavity described: a dale. All operations are parallel, possible to realize clock-less. Convexities define what is the background. They are treated as separate gray objects. There are multiple relations among them and their descendants. Via that, topological size of concavities is proposed. Constructed with the same type of operations, Rays and Angles in a tiling define possible spatial relations. Notions like "strokes" are defined through concavities. Unusual effects on levelized gray objects are shown. It is illustrated how alphabet and complex hieroglyphs can be described through concavities and their relations. A hypothesis of living organisms image analysis is proposed. A number of examples with symbols and a human face are calculated with new Asynchwave C++ software library.

已经做出努力向数学家展示一些应用于图像分析的新思想。灰色图像呈现为倾斜。基于瓦片的拓扑性质，构造了一些灰色凸包：极大，最小，导向的凸包，并证明了其中的一些。他们只有一个操作。在约束和允许类型的操作中使用了两个分段。新型的凹面描述：戴尔。所有的操作是并行的，可能实现无时钟。凸起定义了背景。他们被视为独立的灰色物体。他们和他们的后代有很多关系。通过这个，提出了凹面的拓扑尺寸。用相同类型的操作构建，平铺中的光线和角度定义可能的空间关系。像“笔画”这样的概念是通过凹陷定义的。显示了灰阶对象的不寻常效果。它说明了如何通过凹进和他们的关系来描述字母表和复杂的象形文字。提出了生物体图像分析的假设。使用新的Asynchwave C ++软件库计算符号和人脸的一些示例。
