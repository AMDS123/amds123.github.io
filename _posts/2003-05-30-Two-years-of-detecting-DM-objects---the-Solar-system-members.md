##### Abstract
With a probability >99% there are grounds to believe that our works on detection of the Dark Electric Matter Objects (daemons), which were lauched in 1996, are crowned with success. The daemons are the relic elementary Planckian black holes(m~30 microgramme) carrying stable electric charge of Ze=10e. During the last two years, the detector made of two horizontal ZnS(Ag) screens of 1 m^2 area has been recording the correlated time-shifted scintillations corresponding to flux 10^-5 m^-2 s^-1 of extraordinary penetrating nuclear-active particles which moved both down and upward with velocity of only \~5-30 km/s. The flux experiences seasonal variations with maxima supposedly corresponding to the Earth transition through shadow and anti-shadow created by the Sun in its motion relative the Galaxy disk daemon population. An accumulation of negative daemons, which stimulate the proton decay in ~1 microsec, inside the Earth and the Sun is explaining a lot of previusly non-understandable facts.
