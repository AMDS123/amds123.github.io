##### Abstract
With a probability >99% there are grounds to believe that our works on detection of the Dark Electric Matter Objects (daemons), which were lauched in 1996, are crowned with success. The daemons are the relic elementary Planckian black holes(m~30 microgramme) carrying stable electric charge of Ze=10e. During the last two years, the detector made of two horizontal ZnS(Ag) screens of 1 m^2 area has been recording the correlated time-shifted scintillations corresponding to flux 10^-5 m^-2 s^-1 of extraordinary penetrating nuclear-active particles which moved both down and upward with velocity of only \~5-30 km/s. The flux experiences seasonal variations with maxima supposedly corresponding to the Earth transition through shadow and anti-shadow created by the Sun in its motion relative the Galaxy disk daemon population. An accumulation of negative daemons, which stimulate the proton decay in ~1 microsec, inside the Earth and the Sun is explaining a lot of previusly non-understandable facts.

有一个概率大于99％的理由相信，我们在1996年发现的黑暗电子物体（守护进程）的检测工作取得了成功。守护进程是携带Ze = 10e的稳定电荷的遗迹初级普朗克黑洞（m〜30微克）。在过去的两年中，由两个水平面积为1平方公尺的ZnS（Ag）屏幕组成的探测器，已经记录了非对称穿透的10 ^ -5m ^ -2s ^ -1的相关时移闪烁核活性颗粒，速度仅为5-30km / s，向下和向上移动。这个通量经历了季节变化，据推测对应于通过太阳在其相对于银河磁盘守护进程的运动中产生的阴影和反阴影的地球转换对应的最大值。负面的守护进程在地球和太阳内部刺激〜1微秒的质子衰变的积累正在解释许多以前不可理解的事实。
