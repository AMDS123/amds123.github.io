##### Abstract
Recent learning-based super-resolution (SR) methods often focus on the dictionary learning or network training. In this paper, we detailedly discuss a new SR framework based on local classification instead of traditional dictionary learning. The proposed efficient and extendible SR framework is named as local patch classification (LPC) based framework. The LPC framework consists of a learning stage and a reconstructing stage. In the learning stage, image patches are classified into different classes by means of the proposed local patch encoding (LPE), and then a projection matrix is computed for each class by utilizing a simple constraint. In the reconstructing stage, an input LR patch can be simply reconstructed by computing its LPE code and then multiplying corresponding projection matrix. Furthermore, we establish the relationship between the proposed method and the anchored neighborhood regression based methods; and we also analyze the extendibility of the proposed framework. The experimental results on several image sets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework.

最近的基于学习的超分辨率（SR）方法通常集中于字典学习或网络培训。在本文中，我们详细讨论了一个基于局部分类的新的SR框架，而不是传统的字典学习。所提出的高效可扩展的SR框架被称为基于本地补丁分类（LPC）的框架。 LPC框架包括一个学习阶段和一个重建阶段。在学习阶段，通过所提出的局部补码编码（LPE）将图像块分为不同的类别，然后利用简单的约束为每个类别计算投影矩阵。在重构阶段，通过计算其LPE码，然后乘以相应的投影矩阵，可以简单地重构输入LR补丁。此外，建立了该方法与基于锚定邻域回归的方法之间的关系;我们还分析了提议框架的可扩展性。在几个图像集上的实验结果证明了所提出的框架的有效性。
