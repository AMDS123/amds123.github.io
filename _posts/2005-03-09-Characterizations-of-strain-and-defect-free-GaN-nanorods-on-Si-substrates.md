##### Abstract
GaN-nanorods grown on Si(111) substrates are found strain- and defect-free as characterized by micro Raman spectroscopy, secondary electron (SE) and cathode-luminescence (CL) imaging. The matrix supporting the nanorods bears the brunt of all strains, strain-relaxations, and defect generations, giving the nanorods an ideal environment to grow to perfection. Photo-excitations by the Raman laser source and electron irradiation during CL imaging lead to an increase of non-equilibrium electrons, suggesting an effective approach to photo-emitting or field emitting device applications. The nanorods, largely isolated from but perfectly aligned with the sustaining matrix, are grown in excellent epitaxy with the Si substrates.
