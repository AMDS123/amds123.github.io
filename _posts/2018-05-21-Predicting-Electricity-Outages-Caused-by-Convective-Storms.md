##### Abstract
We consider the problem of predicting power outages in an electrical power grid due to hazards produced by convective storms. These storms produce extreme weather phenomena such as intense wind, tornadoes and lightning over a small area. In this paper, we discuss the application of state-of-the-art machine learning techniques, such as random forest classifiers and deep neural networks, to predict the amount of damage caused by storms. We cast this application as a classification problem where the goal is to classify storm cells into a finite number of classes, each corresponding to a certain amount of expected damage. The classification method use as input features estimates for storm cell location and movement which has to be extracted from the raw data. A main challenge of this application is that the training data is heavily imbalanced as the occurrence of extreme weather events is rare. In order to address this issue, we applied SMOTE technique.

我们考虑预测由于对流风暴产生的危害而造成的电网停电问题。这些风暴会产生极端的天气现象，例如小范围内的强风，龙卷风和闪电。在本文中，我们讨论最先进的机器学习技术（如随机森林分类器和深度神经网络）的应用，以预测风暴造成的损害的数量。我们将这个应用程序作为一个分类问题，其目标是将风暴单元划分为有限数量的类别，每个类别对应一定数量的预期损害。该分类方法用作输入特征估计值，以便从原始数据中提取风暴单元的位置和运动。这个应用程序的一个主要挑战是训练数据严重不平衡，因为极端天气事件的发生很少。为了解决这个问题，我们应用了SMOTE技术。
