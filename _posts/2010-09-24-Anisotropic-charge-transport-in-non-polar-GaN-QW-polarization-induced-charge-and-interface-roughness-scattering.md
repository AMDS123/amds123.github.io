##### Abstract
Charge transport in GaN quantum well (QW) devices grown in non-polar direction has been theoretically investigated . Emergence of anisotropic line charge scattering mechanism originating as a result of anisotropic rough surface morphology in conjunction with in-plane built-in polarization has been proposed. It has shown that in-plane growth anisotropy leads to large anisotropic carrier transport at low temperatures. At high temperatures, this anisotropy in charge transport is partially washed out by strong isotropic optical phonon scattering in GaN QW.
