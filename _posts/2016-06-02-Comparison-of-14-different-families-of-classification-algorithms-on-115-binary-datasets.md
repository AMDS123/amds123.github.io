##### Abstract
We tested 14 very different classification algorithms (random forest, gradient boosting machines, SVM - linear, polynomial, and RBF - 1-hidden-layer neural nets, extreme learning machines, k-nearest neighbors and a bagging of knn, naive Bayes, learning vector quantization, elastic net logistic regression, sparse linear discriminant analysis, and a boosting of linear classifiers) on 115 real life binary datasets. We followed the Demsar analysis and found that the three best classifiers (random forest, gbm and RBF SVM) are not significantly different from each other. We also discuss that a change of less then 0.0112 in the error rate should be considered as an irrelevant change, and used a Bayesian ANOVA analysis to conclude that with high probability the differences between these three classifiers is not of practical consequence. We also verified the execution time of "standard implementations" of these algorithms and concluded that RBF SVM is the fastest (significantly so) both in training time and in training plus testing time.

我们测试了14种非常不同的分类算法（随机森林，梯度提升机，SVM-线性，多项式和RBF-1隐层神经网络，极限学习机，k-最近邻和一个knn包，朴素贝叶斯，学习矢量量化，弹性网络逻辑回归，稀疏线性判别分析和线性分类器提升）对115个真实生活二进制数据集。我们遵循Demsar分析，发现三个最好的分类器（随机森林，gbm和RBF SVM）彼此没有显着差异。我们还讨论了误差率小于0.0112的变化应该被认为是不相关的变化，并且使用贝叶斯ANOVA分析来得出结论：以高概率，这三个分类器之间的差异是不实际的结果。我们还验证了这些算法的“标准实现”的执行时间，并得出RBF SVM在训练时间和训练加测试时间上是最快（显着如此）的结论。
