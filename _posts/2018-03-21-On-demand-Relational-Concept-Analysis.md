##### Abstract
Formal Concept Analysis and its associated conceptual structures have been used to support exploratory search through conceptual navigation. Relational Concept Analysis (RCA) is an extension of Formal Concept Analysis to process relational datasets. RCA and its multiple interconnected structures represent good candidates to support exploratory search in relational datasets, as they are enabling navigation within a structure as well as between the connected structures. However, building the entire structures does not present an efficient solution to explore a small localised area of the dataset, for instance to retrieve the closest alternatives to a given query. In these cases, generating only a concept and its neighbour concepts at each navigation step appears as a less costly alternative. In this paper, we propose an algorithm to compute a concept and its neighbourhood in extended concept lattices. The concepts are generated directly from the relational context family, and possess both formal and relational attributes. The algorithm takes into account two RCA scaling operators. We illustrate it on an example.

正式的概念分析及其相关的概念结构已被用于支持通过概念导航进行探索性搜索。关系概念分析（RCA）是形式概念分析处理关系数据集的扩展。 RCA及其多个相互关联的结构是支持关系数据集探索性搜索的好候选对象，因为它们可以在结构内以及连接结构之间进行导航。然而，构建整个结构并不能提供一种有效的解决方案来探索数据集的小局部区域，例如检索给定查询的最接近的替代方案。在这些情况下，在每个导航步骤中仅生成一个概念及其邻居概念似乎是一种成本较低的替代方案。在本文中，我们提出了一种在扩展概念格中计算概念及其邻域的算法。这些概念直接来自关系上下文族，并且具有正式和关系属性。该算法考虑了两个RCA缩放运算符。我们用一个例子来说明它。
