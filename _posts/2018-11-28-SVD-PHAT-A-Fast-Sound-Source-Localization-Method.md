##### Abstract
This paper introduces a new localization method called SVD-PHAT. The SVD-PHAT method relies on Singular Value Decomposition of the SRP-PHAT projection matrix. A k-d tree is also proposed to speed up the search for the most likely direction of arrival of sound. We show that this method performs as accurately as SRP-PHAT, while reducing significantly the amount of computation required.
