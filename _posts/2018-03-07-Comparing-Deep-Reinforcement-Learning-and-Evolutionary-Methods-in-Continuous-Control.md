##### Abstract
Reinforcement Learning and the Evolutionary Strategy are two major approaches in addressing complicated control problems. Both are strong contenders and have their own devotee communities. Both groups have been very active in developing new advances in their own domain and devising, in recent years, leading-edge techniques to address complex continuous control tasks. Here, in the context of Deep Reinforcement Learning, we formulate a parallelized version of the Proximal Policy Optimization method and a Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient method. Moreover, we conduct a thorough comparison between the state-of-the-art techniques in both camps fro continuous control; evolutionary methods and Deep Reinforcement Learning methods. The results show there is no consistent winner.

强化学习和进化策略是解决复杂控制问题的两种主要方法。两者都是强有力的竞争者，并拥有自己的奉献者社区。两个小组都非常积极地开发自己领域的新进展，并且近年来制定了处理复杂连续控制任务的尖端技术。在这里，在Deep Reinforcement Learning的背景下，我们制定了近似策略优化方法和Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient方法的并行版本。此外，我们对两个阵营中连续控制的最先进技术进行了彻底比较;进化方法和深度强化学习方法。结果显示没有一致的赢家。
