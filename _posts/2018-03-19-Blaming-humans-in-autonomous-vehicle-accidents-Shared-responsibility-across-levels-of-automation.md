##### Abstract
When a semi-autonomous car crashes and harms someone, how are blame and causal responsibility distributed across the human and machine drivers? In this article, we consider cases in which a pedestrian was hit and killed by a car being operated under shared control of a primary and a secondary driver. We find that when only one driver makes an error, that driver receives the blame and is considered causally responsible for the harm, regardless of whether that driver is a machine or a human. However, when both drivers make errors in cases of shared control between a human and a machine, the blame and responsibility attributed to the machine is reduced. This finding portends a public under-reaction to the malfunctioning AI components of semi-autonomous cars and therefore has a direct policy implication: a bottom-up regulatory scheme (which operates through tort law that is adjudicated through the jury system) could fail to properly regulate the safety of shared-control vehicles; instead, a top-down scheme (enacted through federal laws) may be called for.

##### Abstract (translated by Google)
当一辆半自动的汽车撞毁和伤害某人时，如何在人机驾驶员之间分配责任和因果责任？在这篇文章中，我们考虑一个行人在主驾驶员和副驾驶员的共同控制下运行的情况。我们发现，只有一名车手出现错误时，该车手会受到指责，并被认为是造成伤害的原因，无论该车手是机器人还是人。但是，当两个司机在人与机器共享控制的情况下出现错误时，归因于机器的责任和责任就会减少。这一发现预示了公众对半自动汽车的故障AI组件的不良反应，因此具有直接的政策含义：自下而上的监管计划（通过通过陪审制度裁定的侵权法运作）可能无法正确规范共享控制车辆的安全;相反，可能需要一个自上而下的方案（通过联邦法律制定）。
