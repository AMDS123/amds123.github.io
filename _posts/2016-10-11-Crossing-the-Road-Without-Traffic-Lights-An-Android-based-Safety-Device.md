##### Abstract
In the absence of pedestrian crossing lights, finding a safe moment to cross the road is often hazardous and challenging, especially for people with visual impairments. We present a reliable low-cost solution, an Android device attached to a traffic sign or lighting pole near the crossing, indicating whether it is safe to cross the road. The indication can be by sound, display, vibration, and various communication modalities provided by the Android device. The integral system camera is aimed at approaching traffic. Optical flow is computed from the incoming video stream, and projected onto an influx map, automatically acquired during a brief training period. The crossing safety is determined based on a 1-dimensional temporal signal derived from the projection. We implemented the complete system on a Samsung Galaxy K-Zoom Android smartphone, and obtained real-time operation. The system achieves promising experimental results, providing pedestrians with sufficiently early warning of approaching vehicles. The system can serve as a stand-alone safety device, that can be installed where pedestrian crossing lights are ruled out. Requiring no dedicated infrastructure, it can be powered by a solar panel and remotely maintained via the cellular network.

在没有行人过街灯的情况下，寻找过马路的安全时机往往是危险和具有挑战性的，特别是对于视力障碍者。我们提供了一个可靠的低成本解决方案，一个安装在交叉路口附近的交通标志或照明灯杆上的Android设备，显示过马路是否安全。指示可以通过声音，显示，振动以及由Android设备提供的各种通信模式。整体系统摄像机旨在接近交通。从输入的视频流计算光流，并将其投影到潮汐图上，在短时间内自动获取。交叉安全性基于从投影导出的1维时间信号来确定。我们在三星Galaxy K-Zoom Android智能手机上实现了完整的系统，并获得了实时操作。该系统取得了良好的实验结果，为行人提供了接近车辆的充分预警。该系统可以作为一个独立的安全装置，可以安装在行人过街灯被排除的地方。不需要专门的基础设施，它可以由太阳能电池板供电，并通过蜂窝网络远程维护。
