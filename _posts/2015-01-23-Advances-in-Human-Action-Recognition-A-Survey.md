##### Abstract
Human action recognition has been an important topic in computer vision due to its many applications such as video surveillance, human machine interaction and video retrieval. One core problem behind these applications is automatically recognizing low-level actions and high-level activities of interest. The former is usually the basis for the latter. This survey gives an overview of the most recent advances in human action recognition during the past several years, following a well-formed taxonomy proposed by a previous survey. From this state-of-the-art survey, researchers can view a panorama of progress in this area for future research.

人类行为识别由于其在视频监控，人机交互和视频检索等诸多领域的应用，一直是计算机视觉领域的一个重要课题。这些应用背后的一个核心问题是自动识别低层次的行为和高层次的兴趣活动。前者通常是后者的基础。本调查概述了过去几年来人类行为识别方面的最新进展，是在先前的调查提出的结构良好的分类标准之后进行的。从这个最先进的调查中，研究人员可以查看这个领域的未来研究进展的全景图。
