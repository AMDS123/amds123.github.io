##### Abstract
In this paper, we study a new learning paradigm for Neural Machine Translation (NMT). Instead of maximizing the likelihood of the human translation as in previous works, we minimize the distinction between human translation and the translation given by an NMT model. To achieve this goal, inspired by the recent success of generative adversarial networks (GANs), we employ an adversarial training architecture and name it as Adversarial-NMT. In Adversarial-NMT, the training of the NMT model is assisted by an adversary, which is an elaborately designed Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The goal of the adversary is to differentiate the translation result generated by the NMT model from that by human. The goal of the NMT model is to produce high quality translations so as to cheat the adversary. A policy gradient method is leveraged to co-train the NMT model and the adversary. Experimental results on English$\rightarrow$French and German$\rightarrow$English translation tasks show that Adversarial-NMT can achieve significantly better translation quality than several strong baselines.

在本文中，我们研究了一种新的神经机器翻译（NMT）的学习范式。我们不是像以前的作品那样最大限度地翻译人类翻译的可能性，而是尽量减少NMT模型给出的人类翻译与翻译之间的区别。为了实现这一目标，受到最近成功的对抗性网络（GANs）的成功启发，我们采用对抗训练架构并将其命名为Adversarial-NMT。在敌对NMT中，NMT模型的训练由对手协助，这是一个精心设计的卷积神经网络（CNN）。对手的目标是区分NMT模型和人类模型的翻译结果。 NMT模式的目标是制作高质量的翻译以欺骗对手。利用政策梯度法来协同训练NMT模型和对手。英语$ \ rightarrow $法语和德语$ \ rightarrow $英语翻译任务的实验结果表明，敌对NMT可以比几个强大的基线获得显着更好的翻译质量。
