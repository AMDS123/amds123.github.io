##### Abstract
A method for segmenting water bodies in optical and synthetic aperture radar (SAR) satellite images is proposed. It makes use of the textural features of the different regions in the image for segmentation. The method consists in a multiscale analysis of the images, which allows us to study the images regularity both, locally and globally. As results of the analysis, coarse multifractal spectra of studied images and a group of images that associates each position (pixel) with its corresponding value of local regularity (or singularity) spectrum are obtained. Thresholds are then applied to the multifractal spectra of the images for the classification. These thresholds are selected after studying the characteristics of the spectra under the assumption that water bodies have larger local regularity than other soil types. Classifications obtained by the multifractal method are compared quantitatively with those obtained by neural networks trained to classify the pixels of the images in covered against uncovered by water. In optical images, the classifications are also compared with those derived using the so-called Normalized Differential Water Index (NDWI).

提出了一种在光学和合成孔径雷达（SAR）卫星图像中分割水体的方法。它利用图像中不同区域的纹理特征进行分割。该方法包括图像的多尺度分析，这使我们能够在本地和全球范围内研究图像的规律性。作为分析的结果，获得了研究图像的粗多重分形谱以及将每个位置（像素）与其对应的局部正则性（或奇异性）谱相关联的一组图像。然后将阈值应用于分类图像的多重分形谱。这些阈值是在假设水体具有比其他土壤类型更大的局部规律性的条件下研究光谱特性后选定的。通过多重分形方法获得的分类与通过训练的神经网络获得的分类进行定量比较，以对图像的像素进行分类以防止水被覆盖。在光学图像中，分类也与使用所谓的归一化差水指数（NDWI）进行比较。
