##### Abstract
We take interest in the early assessment of risk for depression in social media users. We focus on the eRisk 2018 dataset, which represents users as a sequence of their written online contributions. We implement four RNN-based systems to classify the users. We explore several aggregations methods to combine predictions on individual posts. Our best model reads through all writings of a user in parallel but uses an attention mechanism to prioritize the most important ones at each timestep.
