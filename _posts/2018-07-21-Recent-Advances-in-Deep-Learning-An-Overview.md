##### Abstract
Deep Learning is one of the newest trends in Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence research. It is also one of the most popular scientific research trends now-a-days. Deep learning methods have brought revolutionary advances in computer vision and machine learning. Every now and then, new and new deep learning techniques are being born, outperforming state-of-the-art machine learning and even existing deep learning techniques. In recent years, the world has seen many major breakthroughs in this field. Since deep learning is evolving at a huge speed, its kind of hard to keep track of the regular advances especially for new researchers. In this paper, we are going to briefly discuss about recent advances in Deep Learning for past few years.
