##### Abstract
In this paper, we apply a general deep learning (DL) framework for the answer selection task, which does not depend on manually defined features or linguistic tools. The basic framework is to build the embeddings of questions and answers based on bidirectional long short-term memory (biLSTM) models, and measure their closeness by cosine similarity. We further extend this basic model in two directions. One direction is to define a more composite representation for questions and answers by combining convolutional neural network with the basic framework. The other direction is to utilize a simple but efficient attention mechanism in order to generate the answer representation according to the question context. Several variations of models are provided. The models are examined by two datasets, including TREC-QA and InsuranceQA. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed models substantially outperform several strong baselines.

在本文中，我们应用一个通用的深度学习（DL）框架来进行答案选择任务，而不依赖于人工定义的特征或语言学工具。基本框架是建立基于双向长时间记忆（biLSTM）模型的问题和答案的嵌入，并通过余弦相似度来测量它们的紧密度。我们进一步从两个方面扩展这个基本模型。一个方向是通过将卷积神经网络与基本框架相结合来定义问题和答案的更复合表示。另一个方向是利用一个简单而有效的注意机制来根据问题上下文产生答案表示。提供了几种不同的模型。模型由两个数据集检查，包括TREC-QA和InsuranceQA。实验结果表明，所提出的模型大大胜过了几个强大的基线。
