##### Abstract
Conventional dual-frequency fringe projection algorithm often suffers from phase unwrapping failure when the frequency ratio between the high frequency and the low one is too large. Zhang et.al. proposed an enhanced two-frequency phase-shifting method to use geometric constraints of digital fringe projection(DFP) to reduce the noise impact due to the large frequency ratio. However, this method needs to calibrate the DFP system and calculate the minimum phase map at the nearest position from the camera perspective, these procedures are are relatively complex and more time-cosuming. In this paper, we proposed an improved method, which eliminates the system calibration and determination in Zhang's method,meanwhile does not need to use the low frequency fringe pattern. In the proposed method,we only need a set of high frequency fringe patterns to measure the object after the high frequency is directly estimated by the experiment. Thus the proposed method can simplify the procedure and improve the speed. Finally, the experimental evaluation is conducted to prove the validity of the proposed method.The results demonstrate that the proposed method can overcome the main disadvantages encountered by Zhang's method.

当高频和低频之间的频率比过大时，传统的双频条纹投影算法经常遭受相位解缠失败。张等人提出了一种增强型双频相移法，利用数字边缘投影（DFP）的几何约束条件来降低由于频率比较大而产生的噪声影响。然而，这种方法需要校准DFP系统，并且从摄像机的角度计算最近的位置处的最小相位图，这些过程相对复杂且耗时更长。在本文中，我们提出了一种改进的方法，它不需要使用低频条纹图案，而是省去了张方法中的系统校准和确定。在所提出的方法中，我们只需要一组高频条纹图案来测量高频被实验后直接估计的物体。因此，所提出的方法可以简化程序并提高速度。最后通过实验评估验证了所提方法的有效性。结果表明，该方法可以克服Zhang方法存在的主要缺点。
