##### Abstract
Speech recognizers trained on close-talking speech do not generalize to distant speech and the word error rate degradation can be as large as 40% absolute. Most studies focus on tackling distant speech recognition as a separate problem, leaving little effort to adapting close-talking speech recognizers to distant speech. In this work, we review several approaches from a domain adaptation perspective. These approaches, including speech enhancement, multi-condition training, data augmentation, and autoencoders, all involve a transformation of the data between domains. We conduct experiments on the AMI data set, where these approaches can be realized under the same controlled setting. These approaches lead to different amounts of improvement under their respective assumptions. The purpose of this paper is to quantify and characterize the performance gap between the two domains, setting up the basis for studying adaptation of speech recognizers from close-talking speech to distant speech. Our results also have implications for improving distant speech recognition.

训练在近距离通话语音上的语音识别器不会推广到远距离语音，单词错误率降低可能高达40％的绝对值。大多数研究集中在解决遥远的语音识别问题作为一个单独的问题，而很少将努力使近距离语音识别器适应遥远的语音。在这项工作中，我们从领域适应的角度回顾了几种方法。这些方法包括语音增强，多条件训练，数据增强和自动编码器，都涉及到域之间的数据转换。我们在AMI数据集上进行实验，这些方法可以在相同的受控设置下实现。这些方法在各自的假设下导致不同程度的改进。本文的目的是量化和表征两个领域之间的表现差距，为研究语音识别器从闭口说话到远端语音的适应性研究奠定基础。我们的结果也对改善远距离语音识别有影响。
