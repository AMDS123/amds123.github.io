##### Abstract
Computational paralinguistic analysis is increasingly being used in a wide range of cyber applications, including security-sensitive applications such as speaker verification, deceptive speech detection, and medical diagnostics. While state-of-the-art machine learning techniques, such as deep neural networks, can provide robust and accurate speech analysis, they are susceptible to adversarial attacks. In this work, we propose an end-to-end scheme to generate adversarial examples for computational paralinguistic applications by perturbing directly the raw waveform of an audio recording rather than specific acoustic features. Our experiments show that the proposed adversarial perturbation can lead to a significant performance drop of state-of-the-art deep neural networks, while only minimally impairing the audio quality.
