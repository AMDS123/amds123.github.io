##### Abstract
Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have demonstrated remarkable results in image classification tasks for benchmark and practical uses. The CNNs with deeper architectures have achieved higher performances recently thanks to their robustness to parallel shift of objects in images aw well as their numerous parameters and resulting high expression ability. However, the CNNs have a limited robustness to other geometric transformations such as scaling and rotation. This problem is considered to limit performance improvement of the deep CNNs but there is no established solution. This study focuses on scale transformation and proposes a novel network architecture called weight-shared multi-stage network (WSMS-Net), consisting of multiple stages of CNNs. The WSMS-Net is easily combined with existing deep CNNs, such as ResNet and DenseNet, and enables them to acquire a robustness to scaling of objects. The experimental results demonstrate that existing deep CNNs combined with the proposed WSMS-Net achieve higher accuracy for image classification tasks only with a little increase in the number of parameters.

卷积神经网络（CNN）已经在基准和实际应用的图像分类任务中显示出显着的结果。近年来，随着体系结构更加深入，CNNs由于其对图像中物体的平行移动以及众多参数的稳健性和高度的表达能力而获得了更高的性能。然而，CNN对其他几何变换如缩放和旋转具有有限的鲁棒性。这个问题被认为是限制了深度CNN的性能改进，但没有确定的解决方案。本研究的重点在于规模变换，提出了一种称为权重共享的多级网络（WSMS-Net）的新型网络体系结构，由CNN的多个阶段组成。 WSMS-Net很容易与现有的深度CNN（如ResNet和DenseNet）相结合，使它们能够获得对物体缩放的鲁棒性。实验结果表明，现有的深度CNNs与所提出的WSMS-Net相结合，仅仅在参数个数有所增加的情况下，对图像分类任务就可以达到更高的精度。
