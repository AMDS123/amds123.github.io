##### Abstract
In this paper, we attempt to solve the problem of Prepositional Phrase (PP) attachments in English. The motivation for the work comes from NLP applications like Machine Translation, for which, getting the correct attachment of prepositions is very crucial. The idea is to correct the PP-attachments for a sentence with the help of alignments from parallel data in another language. The novelty of our work lies in the formulation of the problem into a dual decomposition based algorithm that enforces agreement between the parse trees from two languages as a constraint. Experiments were performed on the English-Hindi language pair and the performance improved by 10% over the baseline, where the baseline is the attachment predicted by the MSTParser model trained for English.

在本文中，我们试图解决英语中介词短语（PP）附件的问题。作品的动机来源于机器翻译等NLP应用，因此，对介词的正确依附是至关重要的。这个想法是借助来自另一种语言的并行数据的对齐来纠正一个句子的PP附件。我们工作的新颖之处在于将问题表达为基于对偶分解的算法，其强制来自两种语言的解析树之间的约定作为约束。在英语 - 印地语语言对上进行实验，并且比基线的表现提高了10％，其中基线是通过训练英语的MSTParser模型预测的附件。
