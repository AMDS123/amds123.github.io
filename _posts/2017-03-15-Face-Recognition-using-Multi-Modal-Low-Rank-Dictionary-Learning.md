##### Abstract
Face recognition has been widely studied due to its importance in different applications; however, most of the proposed methods fail when face images are occluded or captured under illumination and pose variations. Recently several low-rank dictionary learning methods have been proposed and achieved promising results for noisy observations. While these methods are mostly developed for single-modality scenarios, recent studies demonstrated the advantages of feature fusion from multiple inputs. We propose a multi-modal structured low-rank dictionary learning method for robust face recognition, using raw pixels of face images and their illumination invariant representation. The proposed method learns robust and discriminative representations from contaminated face images, even if there are few training samples with large intra-class variations. Extensive experiments on different datasets validate the superior performance and robustness of our method to severe illumination variations and occlusion.

人脸识别由于其在不同应用中的重要性而被广泛研究;然而，当面部图像在照明和姿态变化下被遮挡或捕获时，大多数所提出的方法失败。最近几种低秩字典学习方法已经被提出并取得了有希望的结果。虽然这些方法大多是针对单一模式的场景而开发的，但最近的研究表明多输入特征融合的优势。我们提出了一种用于鲁棒人脸识别的多模式结构化的低秩字典学习方法，使用人脸图像的原始像素及其光照不变表示。所提出的方法学习来自受污染人脸图像的鲁棒性和区分性表示，即使只有很少的具有大的类内变化的训练样本。在不同的数据集上进行广泛的实验验证了我们的方法对严重照明变化和遮挡的优越性能和鲁棒性。
