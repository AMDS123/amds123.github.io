##### Abstract
Medical errors are leading causes of death in the US and as such, prevention of these errors is paramount to promoting health care. Patient Safety Event reports are narratives describing potential adverse events to the patients and are important in identifying and preventing medical errors. We present a neural network architecture for identifying the type of safety events which is the first step in understanding these narratives. Our proposed model is based on a soft neural attention model to improve the effectiveness of encoding long sequences. Empirical results on two large-scale real-world datasets of patient safety reports demonstrate the effectiveness of our method with significant improvements over existing methods.

在美国，医疗错误是导致死亡的主要原因，因此，预防这些错误对于促进医疗保健至关重要。患者安全事件报告是描述对患者的潜在不良事件的叙述，对于识别和预防医疗错误非常重要。我们提出了一个识别安全事件类型的神经网络架构，这是理解这些叙述的第一步。我们提出的模型是基于一个软神经注意模型来提高编码长序列的有效性。两个大规模真实世界的病人安全报告数据集的实证结果证明了我们的方法的有效性，显着改善了现有的方法。
