##### Abstract
This paper proposes the adaptation of Support Vector Data Description (SVDD) to the multiple kernel case (MK-SVDD), based on SimpleMKL. It also introduces a variant called Slim-MK-SVDD that is able to produce a tighter frontier around the data. For the sake of comparison, the equivalent methods are also developed for One-Class SVM, known to be very similar to SVDD for certain shapes of kernels. 
 Those algorithms are illustrated in the context of 3D-shapes filtering and outliers detection. For the 3D-shapes problem, the objective is to be able to select a sub-category of 3D-shapes, each sub-category being learned with our algorithm in order to create a filter. For outliers detection, we apply the proposed algorithms for unsupervised outliers detection as well as for the supervised case.

##### Abstract (translated by Google)
本文提出了基于SimpleMKL的支持向量数据描述（SVDD）到多核情况（MK-SVDD）的改进。它还引入了一种称为Slim-MK-SVDD的变体，能够在数据周围产生更紧密的边界。为了比较，也为一类SVM开发了等价的方法，对于某些形状的核心，已知与SVDD非常相似。
 这些算法在3D形状滤波和异常值检测的背景下进行说明。对于3D形状问题，目标是能够选择3D形状的子类别，每个子类别通过我们的算法学习以创建过滤器。对于异常值检测，我们将所提出的算法用于无监督异常值检测以及监督案例。
