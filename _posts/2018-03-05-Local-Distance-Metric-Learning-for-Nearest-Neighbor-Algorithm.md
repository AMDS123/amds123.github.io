##### Abstract
Distance metric learning is a successful way to enhance the performance of the nearest neighbor classifier. In most cases, however, the distribution of data does not obey a regular form and may change in different parts of the feature space. Regarding that, this paper proposes a novel local distance metric learning method, namely Local Mahalanobis Distance Learning (LMDL), in order to enhance the performance of the nearest neighbor classifier. LMDL considers the neighborhood influence and learns multiple distance metrics for a reduced set of input samples. The reduced set is called as prototypes which try to preserve local discriminative information as much as possible. The proposed LMDL can be kernelized very easily, which is significantly desirable in the case of highly nonlinear data. The quality as well as the efficiency of the proposed method assesses through a set of different experiments on various datasets and the obtained results show that LDML as well as the kernelized version is superior to the other related state-of-the-art methods.

距离度量学习是提高最近邻分类器性能的成功方法。但是，在大多数情况下，数据分布不符合常规形式，并可能在特征空间的不同部分发生变化。为此，本文提出了一种新的局部距离度量学习方法，即本地马氏距离学习（LMDL），以提高最近邻分类器的性能。 LMDL考虑邻域影响，并针对一组缩减的输入样本学习多个距离度量。缩减集被称为试图尽可能保留局部区分性信息的原型。所提出的LMDL可以很容易地核化，这在高度非线性数据的情况下是非常理想的。所提出的方法的质量和效率通过在各种数据集上的一组不同的实验来评估，并且所获得的结果显示LDML以及核化版本优于其他相关的最新技术方法。
