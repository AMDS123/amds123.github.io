##### Abstract
Image distortion correction is a critical pre-processing step for a variety of computer vision and image processing algorithms. Standard real-time software implementations are generally not suited for direct hardware porting, so appropriated versions need to be designed in order to obtain implementations deployable on FPGAs. In this paper, hardware-compatible techniques for image distortion correction are introduced and analyzed in details. The considered solutions are compared in terms of output quality by using a geometrical-error-based approach, with particular emphasis on robustness with respect to increasing lens distortion. The required amount of hardware resources is also estimated for each considered approach.

图像失真校正是各种计算机视觉和图像处理算法的关键预处理步骤。标准的实时软件实现通常不适合直接硬件移植，因此需要设计专用版本以获得可在FPGA上部署的实现。本文介绍了硬件兼容的图像失真校正技术，并对其进行了详细分析。所考虑的解决方案通过使用基于几何误差的方法在输出质量方面进行比较，特别强调关于增加透镜畸变的鲁棒性。还为每个考虑的方法估计所需的硬件资源量。
