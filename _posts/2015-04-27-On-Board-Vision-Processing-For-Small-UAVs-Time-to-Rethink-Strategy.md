##### Abstract
The ultimate research goal for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) is to facilitate autonomy of operation. Research in the last decade has highlighted the potential of vision sensing in this regard. Although vital for accomplishment of missions assigned to any type of unmanned aerial vehicles, vision sensing is more critical for small aerial vehicles due to lack of high precision inertial sensors. In addition, uncertainty of GPS signal in indoor and urban environments calls for more reliance on vision sensing for such small vehicles. With off-line processing does not offer an attractive option in terms of autonomy, these vehicles have been challenging platforms to implement vision processing onboard due to their strict payload capacity and power budget. The strict constraints drive the need for new vision processing architectures for small unmanned aerial vehicles. Recent research has shown encouraging results with FPGA based hardware architectures. This paper reviews the bottle necks involved in implementing vision processing on-board, advocates the potential of hardware based solutions to tackle strict constraints of small unmanned aerial vehicles and finally analyzes feasibility of ASICs, Structured ASICs and FPGAs for use on future systems.

##### Abstract (translated by Google)
无人机的最终研究目标是促进操作的自主性。在过去十年的研究突出了这方面的视觉传感的潜力。尽管对完成分配给任何类型无人驾驶飞行器的任务来说是至关重要的，但由于缺少高精度惯性传感器，对于小型飞行器而言，视觉感测更为重要。另外，在室内和城市环境中的GPS信号的不确定性要求更多地依靠这种小型车辆的视觉感测。离线处理在自主性方面并不具有吸引力，因为其严格的有效载荷能力和功率预算，这些车辆一直是具有挑战性的实施视觉处理的平台。严格的限制推动了对小型无人机新型视觉处理架构的需求。最近的研究表明，基于FPGA的硬件架构令人鼓舞。本文综述了实现视觉处理的瓶颈，提出了基于硬件的解决方案解决小型无人机严格约束的潜力，最后分析了ASIC，结构化ASIC和FPGA在未来系统上的可行性。
