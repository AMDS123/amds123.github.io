##### Abstract
In this paper, we present a detailed analysis on extracting soft biometric traits, age and gender, from ear images. Although there have been a few previous work on gender classification using ear images, to the best of our knowledge, this study is the first work on age classification from ear images. In the study, we have utilized both geometric features and appearance-based features for ear representation. The utilized geometric features are based on eight anthropometric landmarks and consist of 14 distance measurements and two area calculations. The appearance-based methods employ deep convolutional neural networks for representation and classification. The well-known convolutional neural network models, namely, AlexNet, VGG-16, GoogLeNet, and SqueezeNet have been adopted for the study. They have been fine-tuned on a large-scale ear dataset that has been built from the profile and close-to-profile face images in the Multi-PIE face dataset. This way, we have performed a domain adaptation. The updated models have been fine-tuned once more time on the small-scale target ear dataset, which contains only around 270 ear images for training. According to the experimental results, appearance-based methods have been found to be superior to the methods based on geometric features. We have achieved 94\% accuracy for gender classification, whereas 52\% accuracy has been obtained for age classification. These results indicate that ear images provide useful cues for age and gender classification, however, further work is required for age estimation.

在本文中，我们提供了从耳朵图像中提取软生物特征，年龄和性别的详细分析。尽管以前有关耳朵图像的性别分类方面的一些工作，但据我们所知，这项研究是第一部关于耳朵图像年龄分类的工作。在研究中，我们利用几何特征和基于外观的特征来表示耳朵。使用的几何特征基于八个人体测量学地标，并且包括14个距离测量和两个面积计算。基于外观的方法采用深度卷积神经网络进行表示和分类。众所周知的卷积神经网络模型，即AlexNet，VGG-16，GoogLeNet和SqueezeNet已被采纳用于研究。他们已经根据Multi-PIE人脸数据集中的轮廓和贴近人脸的人脸图像进行了大规模耳朵数据集的微调。这样，我们已经进行了域适应。更新后的模型在小规模目标耳朵数据集上再次进行了微调，该数据集仅包含270个左右耳朵的训练图像。根据实验结果，已经发现基于外观的方法优于基于几何特征的方法。我们已经达到了94％的性别分类准确率，而年龄分类的准确率达到了52％。这些结果表明耳朵图像为年龄和性别分类提供了有用的线索，但是，年龄估计需要进一步的工作。
