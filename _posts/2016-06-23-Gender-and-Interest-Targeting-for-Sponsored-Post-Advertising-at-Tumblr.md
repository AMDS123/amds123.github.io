##### Abstract
As one of the leading platforms for creative content, Tumblr offers advertisers a unique way of creating brand identity. Advertisers can tell their story through images, animation, text, music, video, and more, and promote that content by sponsoring it to appear as an advertisement in the streams of Tumblr users. In this paper we present a framework that enabled one of the key targeted advertising components for Tumblr, specifically gender and interest targeting. We describe the main challenges involved in development of the framework, which include creating the ground truth for training gender prediction models, as well as mapping Tumblr content to an interest taxonomy. For purposes of inferring user interests we propose a novel semi-supervised neural language model for categorization of Tumblr content (i.e., post tags and post keywords). The model was trained on a large-scale data set consisting of 6.8 billion user posts, with very limited amount of categorized keywords, and was shown to have superior performance over the bag-of-words model. We successfully deployed gender and interest targeting capability in Yahoo production systems, delivering inference for users that cover more than 90% of daily activities at Tumblr. Online performance results indicate advantages of the proposed approach, where we observed 20% lift in user engagement with sponsored posts as compared to untargeted campaigns.

##### Abstract (translated by Google)
作为创意内容的领先平台之一，Tumblr为广告主提供了创建品牌标识的独特方式。广告商可以通过图片，动画，文字，音乐，视频等来讲述他们的故事，并通过赞助它来在Tumblr用户的流中出现广告来宣传这些内容。在本文中，我们提出了一个框架，使Tumblr的主要目标广告组件之一，特别是性别和利益目标。我们描述框架发展所涉及的主要挑战，包括为培训性别预测模型创建基本事实，以及将Tumblr内容映射到兴趣分类。出于推断用户兴趣的目的，我们提出了一种用于Tumblr内容分类（即帖子标签和帖子关键词）的新型半监督神经语言模型。该模型在一个由68亿用户帖子组成的大规模数据集上进行了培训，分类关键字数量非常有限，并且显示出它比词袋模型具有更好的性能。我们在雅虎生产系统中成功部署了性别和利益目标定位功能，为在Tumblr上覆盖90％以上日常活动的用户提供推断。在线绩效结果显示了建议方法的优势，与非目标广告系列相比，我们观察到用户参与赞助职位的比例提高了20％。
