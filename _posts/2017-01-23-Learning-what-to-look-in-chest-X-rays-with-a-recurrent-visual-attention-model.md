##### Abstract
X-rays are commonly performed imaging tests that use small amounts of radiation to produce pictures of the organs, tissues, and bones of the body. X-rays of the chest are used to detect abnormalities or diseases of the airways, blood vessels, bones, heart, and lungs. In this work we present a stochastic attention-based model that is capable of learning what regions within a chest X-ray scan should be visually explored in order to conclude that the scan contains a specific radiological abnormality. The proposed model is a recurrent neural network (RNN) that learns to sequentially sample the entire X-ray and focus only on informative areas that are likely to contain the relevant information. We report on experiments carried out with more than $100,000$ X-rays containing enlarged hearts or medical devices. The model has been trained using reinforcement learning methods to learn task-specific policies.

X射线是通常进行的成像测试，其使用少量的辐射来产生人体器官，组织和骨骼的图片。胸部的X射线被用于检测呼吸道，血管，骨骼，心脏和肺部的异常或疾病。在这项工作中，我们提出了一个随机的基于注意力的模型，能够了解胸部X射线扫描范围内的哪些区域应该进行视觉探查，以得出扫描结果包含特定放射异常的结论。所提出的模型是循环神经网络（RNN），学习依次对整个X射线进行采样，并仅着重于可能包含相关信息的信息区域。我们报告了使用放大的心脏或医疗设备进行的超过100,000美元的X射线的实验。该模型已经使用强化学习方法进行了培训，以学习特定于任务的策略。
