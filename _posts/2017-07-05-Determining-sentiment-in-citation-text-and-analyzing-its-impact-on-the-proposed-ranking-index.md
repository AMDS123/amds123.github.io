##### Abstract
Whenever human beings interact with each other, they exchange or express opinions, emotions, and sentiments. These opinions can be expressed in text, speech or images. Analysis of these sentiments is one of the popular research areas of present day researchers. Sentiment analysis, also known as opinion mining tries to identify or classify these sentiments or opinions into two broad categories - positive and negative. In recent years, the scientific community has taken a lot of interest in analyzing sentiment in textual data available in various social media platforms. Much work has been done on social media conversations, blog posts, newspaper articles and various narrative texts. However, when it comes to identifying emotions from scientific papers, researchers have faced some difficulties due to the implicit and hidden nature of opinion. By default, citation instances are considered inherently positive in emotion. Popular ranking and indexing paradigms often neglect the opinion present while citing. In this paper, we have tried to achieve three objectives. First, we try to identify the major sentiment in the citation text and assign a score to the instance. We have used a statistical classifier for this purpose. Secondly, we have proposed a new index (we shall refer to it hereafter as M-index) which takes into account both the quantitative and qualitative factors while scoring a paper. Thirdly, we developed a ranking of research papers based on the M-index. We also try to explain how the M-index impacts the ranking of scientific papers.

##### Abstract (translated by Google)
每当人类互相交流，他们交换或表达意见，情感和情感。这些意见可以用文字，语言或图像来表达。对这些情绪的分析是当今研究人员流行的研究领域之一。情感分析（也称为意见挖掘）试图将这些情绪或观点分为两类，即正面和负面。近年来，科学界对各种社交媒体平台上的文本数据情感分析引起了极大的兴趣。社交媒体对话，博客文章，报纸文章和各种叙事文本已经做了大量的工作。然而，从科学论文中识别情感时，由于意见的隐含性和隐含性，研究者面临一些困难。默认情况下，引用实例在情感上被认为是内在的积极的。受欢迎的排名和索引模式通常会忽略当前引用的意见。在本文中，我们试图实现三个目标。首先，我们试图找出引文中的主要情绪，并为实例指定一个分数。为此我们使用了统计分类器。其次，我们提出了一个新的指数（我们将其称为M指数），同时考虑到定量和定性因素，同时得到一个文件。第三，我们根据M指数制定了研究论文的排名。我们也试图解释M指数如何影响科学论文的排名。
