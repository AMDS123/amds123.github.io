##### Abstract
Consumers often react expressively to products such as food samples, perfume, jewelry, sunglasses, and clothing accessories. This research discusses a multimodal affect recognition system developed to classify whether a consumer likes or dislikes a product tested at a counter or kiosk, by analyzing the consumer's facial expression, body posture, hand gestures, and voice after testing the product. A depth-capable camera and microphone system - Kinect for Windows - is utilized. An emotion identification engine has been developed to analyze the images and voice to determine affective state of the customer. The image is segmented using skin color and adaptive threshold. Face, body and hands are detected using the Haar cascade classifier. Canny edges are identified and the lip, body and hand contours are extracted using spatial filtering. Edge count and orientation around the mouth, cheeks, eyes, shoulders, fingers and the location of the edges are used as features. Classification is done by an emotion template mapping algorithm and training a classifier using support vector machines. The real-time performance, accuracy and feasibility for multimodal affect recognition in feedback assessment are evaluated.

消费者通常对食品样本，香水，珠宝，太阳镜和服装配件等产品有明显的反应。这项研究讨论了一种多模式情感识别系统，通过分析消费者在测试产品后的面部表情，身体姿势，手势和声音来分类消费者喜欢还是不喜欢在柜台或售货亭进行测试的产品。利用深度的摄像头和麦克风系统 -  Windows的Kinect。已经开发了情绪识别引擎来分析图像和语音以确定顾客的情感状态。图像使用肤色和自适应阈值分割。使用Haar级联分类器检测脸部，身体和手部。 Canny边被识别，唇，身体和手的轮廓使用空间滤波来提取。用嘴，脸颊，眼睛，肩膀，手指和边缘位置的边缘数量和方向作为特征。分类是通过情感模板映射算法完成的，并使用支持向量机对分类器进行训练。评估反馈评估中多模态影响识别的实时性，准确性和可行性。
