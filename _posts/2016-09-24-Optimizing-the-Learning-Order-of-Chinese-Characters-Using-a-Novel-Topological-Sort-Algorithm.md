##### Abstract
We present a novel algorithm for optimizing the order in which Chinese characters are learned, one that incorporates the benefits of learning them in order of usage frequency and in order of their hierarchal structural relationships. We show that our work outperforms previously published orders and algorithms. Our algorithm is applicable to any scheduling task where nodes have intrinsic differences in importance and must be visited in topological order.

我们提出了一种新颖的算法来优化学习汉字的顺序，这个算法结合了学习汉字的好处，按照使用频率的顺序，并且按照它们的层次结构关系。我们表明，我们的工作胜过以前发布的订单和算法。我们的算法适用于任何节点具有内在重要性差异并且必须按照拓扑顺序访问的调度任务。
