##### Abstract
This paper addresses the problem of corpus-level entity typing, i.e., inferring from a large corpus that an entity is a member of a class such as "food" or "artist". The application of entity typing we are interested in is knowledge base completion, specifically, to learn which classes an entity is a member of. We propose FIGMENT to tackle this problem. FIGMENT is embedding-based and combines (i) a global model that scores based on aggregated contextual information of an entity and (ii) a context model that first scores the individual occurrences of an entity and then aggregates the scores. In our evaluation, FIGMENT strongly outperforms an approach to entity typing that relies on relations obtained by an open information extraction system.

本文讨论了语料库级实体类型的问题，即从大语料库推断实体是诸如“食物”或“艺术家”的类的成员。我们感兴趣的实体类型的应用是知识库完成，特别是学习实体是哪个类的成员。我们提出图解来解决这个问题。 FIGMENT是基于嵌入的并且结合（i）基于实体的聚合上下文信息评分的全局模型和（ii）首先对实体的单独出现进行评分然后聚合评分的上下文模型。在我们的评估中，FIGMENT强烈地胜过了依靠开放信息提取系统获得的关系的实体类型的方法。
