##### Abstract
From 1936-38, the Works Progress Administration interviewed thousands of former slaves about their life experiences. While these interviews are crucial to understanding the "peculiar institution" from the standpoint of the slave himself, issues relating to bias cloud analyses of these interviews. The problem I investigate is the problem of candour in the WPA slave narratives: it is widely held in the historical community that the strict racial caste system of the Deep South compelled black ex-slaves to tell white interviewers what they thought they wanted to hear, suggesting that there was a significant difference candour depending on whether their interviewer was white or black. In this work, I attempt to quantitatively characterise this race-related problem of candour. Prior work has either been of an impressionistic, qualitative nature, or utilised exceedingly simple quantitative methodology. In contrast, I use more sophisticated statistical methods: in particular word frequency and sentiment analysis and comparative topic modelling with LDA to try and identify differences in the content and sentiment expressed by ex-slaves in front of white interviewers versus black interviewers. While my sentiment analysis methodology was ultimately unsuccessful due to the complexity of the task, my word frequency analysis and comparative topic modelling methods both showed strong evidence that the content expressed in front of white interviewers was different from that of black interviewers. In particular, I found that the ex-slaves spoke much more about unfavourable aspects of slavery like whipping and slave patrollers in front of interviewers of their own race. I hope that my more-sophisticated statistical methodology helps improve the robustness of the argument for the existence of this problem of candour in the slave narratives, which some would seek to deny for revisionist purposes.

从1936年至1938年，工程进展管理局采访了数千名前奴隶关于他们的生活经历。虽然这些访谈对于从奴隶本身的角度来理解“特殊制度”至关重要，但与这些访谈的偏见云分析有关的问题。我调查的问题是WPA奴隶叙述中坦率的问题：在历史社区中广泛存在的是，深南的严格的种族种姓制度迫使黑人前奴隶告诉白人采访者他们认为他们想听到的内容，这表明根据面试官是白人还是黑人，他们之间存在显着差异。在这项工作中，我试图定量描述这个与种族有关的坦率的问题。以前的工作要么是印象主义的，定性的，要么是采用极其简单的定量方法。相比之下，我使用更复杂的统计方法：尤其是词频和情感分析以及与LDA进行比较主题建模，以试图找出白人面试官与黑人面试官面前的前奴隶们表达的内容和情绪的差异。虽然我的情绪分析方法由于任务的复杂性而最终失败，但我的词频分析和比较主题建模方法都显示出有力的证据，表明在白人面试官面前表达的内容与黑人面试官不同。特别是，我发现前奴隶在谈到自己种族的采访者时，谈到奴隶制的不利方面，比如鞭打和奴隶巡逻队员。我希望我的更复杂的统计方法有助于改善奴隶叙述中存在这种坦率问题的论证的稳健性，有些人会试图否认修正主义的目的。
