##### Abstract
In this paper, we address multimodal language understanding for unconstrained fetching instruction in domestic service robots context. A typical fetching instruction such as "Bring me the yellow toy from the white shelf" requires to infer the user intention, that is what object (target) to fetch and from where (source). To solve the task, we propose a Multimodal Target-source Classifier Model (MTCM), which predicts the region-wise likelihood of target and source candidates in the scene. Unlike other methods, MTCM can handle regionwise classification based on linguistic and visual features. We evaluated our approach that outperformed the state-of-the-art method on a standard data set. In addition, we extended MTCM with Generative Adversarial Nets (MTCM-GAN), and enabled simultaneous data augmentation and classification.
