##### Abstract
Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been generally acknowledged as one of the driving forces for the advancement of computer vision. Despite their promising performances on many tasks, CNNs still face major obstacles on the road to achieving ideal machine intelligence. One is the difficulty of interpreting them and understanding their inner workings, which is important for diagnosing their failures and correcting them. Another is that standard CNNs require large amounts of annotated data, which is sometimes very hard to obtain. Hence, it is desirable to enable them to learn from few examples. In this work, we address these two limitations of CNNs by developing novel and interpretable models for few-shot learning. Our models are based on the idea of encoding objects in terms of visual concepts, which are interpretable visual cues represented within CNNs. We first use qualitative visualizations and quantitative statistics, to uncover several key properties of feature encoding using visual concepts. Motivated by these properties, we present two intuitive models for the problem of few-shot learning. Experiments show that our models achieve competitive performances, while being much more flexible and interpretable than previous state-of-the-art few-shot learning methods. We conclude that visual concepts expose the natural capability of CNNs for few-shot learning.

卷积神经网络（CNN）已被公认为推动计算机视觉发展的驱动力之一。尽管CNN在许多任务上表现出色，但在实现理想机器智能的道路上仍然面临重大障碍。一个是解释它们并理解它们的内在运作的困难，这对于诊断它们的失败和纠正它们是重要的。另一个是标准CNN需要大量的注释数据，有时很难获得。因此，让他们从少数例子中学习是可取的。在这项工作中，我们通过开发新颖的和可解释的少数学习模式来解决CNN的这两个局限性。我们的模型是基于用视觉概念来编码对象的想法，视觉概念是在CNN中表示的可解释的视觉线索。我们首先使用定性可视化和定量统计来揭示使用视觉概念进行特征编码的几个关键属性。受这些特性的驱动，我们提出了两个直观的模型来解决少量学习的问题。实验表明，我们的模型实现了竞争性的表现，而比以前最先进的少数几种学习方法更灵活和可解释。我们得出这样的结论：视觉概念揭示了CNNs的自然能力，用于少量的学习。
