##### Abstract
A galaxy-sized halo may contain a large number of intermediate mass (10^{2-4} solar mass) compact objects (IMCOs), which can be intermediate mass black holes (IMBHs) or the CDM subhalos. We propose to directly detect the IMBHs by observing multiply imaged QSO-galaxy lens systems with a high angular resolution (~ 0.03mas), which would be achieved by the next-VLBI space missions. The silhouette of the IMBHs would appear as an either monopole-like or dipole-like variation at the scale of the Einstein radius against the QSO jets. As a byproduct, we can also directly detect the 10^{4-5} solar mass CDM subhalos. From a measurement of the local distortion in the surface brightness of the QSO jet, we can make a distinction between a point mass (corresponding to an IMBH) and an extended structure (corresponding to a CDM subhalo). It would be a unique probe of the IMCOs whose nature has been under the veil of mistery.
