##### Abstract
Today, one of the major challenges that autonomous vehicles are facing is the ability to drive in urban environments. Such a task requires communication between autonomous vehicles and other road users in order to resolve various traffic ambiguities. The interaction between road users is a form of negotiation in which the parties involved have to share their attention regarding a common objective or a goal (e.g. crossing an intersection), and coordinate their actions in order to accomplish it. In this literature review we aim to address the interaction problem between pedestrians and drivers (or vehicles) from joint attention point of view. More specifically, we will discuss the theoretical background behind joint attention, its application to traffic interaction and practical approaches to implementing joint attention for autonomous vehicles.

如今，自动驾驶汽车面临的主要挑战之一是在城市环境中驾驶的能力。这样的任务需要自主车辆和其他道路使用者之间的通信以解决各种交通模糊。道路使用者之间的相互作用是一种谈判形式，有关各方必须分享他们对共同目标或目标（例如过路口）的关注，并协调其行动以实现目标。在这篇文献综述中，我们旨在从共同关注的角度来解决行人与司机（或车辆）之间的相互作用问题。更具体地说，我们将讨论联合关注背后的理论背景，交通互动的应用以及实现自主车辆共同关注的实用方法。
