##### Abstract
The organization and evolution of science has recently become itself an object of scientific quantitative investigation, thanks to the wealth of information that can be extracted from scientific documents, such as citations between papers and co-authorship between researchers. However, only few studies have focused on the concepts that characterize full documents and that can be extracted and analyzed, revealing the deeper organization of scientific knowledge. Unfortunately, several concepts can be so common across documents that they hinder the emergence of the underlying topical structure of the document corpus, because they give rise to a large amount of spurious and trivial relations among documents. To identify and remove common concepts, we introduce a method to gauge their relevance according to an objective information-theoretic measure related to the statistics of their occurrence across the document corpus. After progressively removing concepts that, according to this metric, can be considered as generic, we find that the topic organization displays a correspondingly more refined structure.

##### Abstract (translated by Google)
科学的组织和进化最近成为科学量化调查的一个对象，这要归功于可以从科学文献中提取的大量信息，例如论文之间的引文和研究人员之间的合着作。然而，只有少数研究集中于描述完整文献的特征，可以提取和分析这些概念，揭示更深层的科学知识组织。不幸的是，在文档中有几个概念是如此常见，以至于它们阻碍文档语料库的基础结构的出现，因为它们在文档之间产生大量虚假和琐碎的关系。为了识别和删除共同的概念，我们引入了一种方法来根据与文档语料库中它们的出现统计相关的客观信息理论度量来评估它们的相关性。在逐步删除根据这个度量标准可以被认为是通用的概念之后，我们发现该话题组织显示出相应更精细的结构。
