##### Abstract
In an economic market, sellers, infomediaries and customers constitute an economic network. Each seller has her own customer group and the seller's private customers are unobservable to other sellers. Therefore, a seller can only sell commodities among her own customers unless other sellers or infomediaries share her sale information to their customer groups. However, a seller is not incentivized to share others' sale information by default, which leads to inefficient resource allocation and limited revenue for the sale. To tackle this problem, we develop a novel mechanism called customer sharing mechanism (CSM) which incentivizes all sellers to share each other's sale information to their private customer groups. Furthermore, CSM also incentivizes all customers to truthfully participate in the sale. In the end, CSM not only allocates the commodities efficiently but also optimizes the seller's revenue.

在经济市场中，卖方，信息中介和客户构成了经济网络。每个卖家都有自己的客户群，卖家的私人客户对其他卖家不可观察。因此，卖方只能在自己的客户中销售商品，除非其他卖家或信息中心将其销售信息分享给他们的客户群。但是，卖方不会被激励默认共享其他人的销售信息，这导致资源分配效率低下，销售收入有限。为了解决这个问题，我们开发了一种称为客户共享机制（CSM）的新机制，它激励所有卖家将他们的销售信息分享给他们的私人客户群。此外，CSM还鼓励所有客户如实参与销售。最后，CSM不仅有效地分配商品，还优化了卖方的收入。
