##### Abstract
In this paper, we propose a new texture analysis method using the deterministic partially self-avoiding walk performed on maps modified with thresholds. In this method, two pixels of the map are neighbors if the Euclidean distance between them is less than $\sqrt{2}$ and the weight (difference between its intensities) is less than a given threshold. The maps obtained by using different thresholds highlight several properties of the image that are extracted by the deterministic walk. To compose the feature vector, deterministic walks are performed with different thresholds and its statistics are concatenated. Thus, this approach can be considered as a multi-scale analysis. We validate our method on the Brodatz database, which is very well known public image database and widely used by texture analysis methods. Experimental results indicate that the proposed method presents a good texture discrimination, overcoming traditional texture methods.

在本文中，我们提出了一种新的纹理分析方法，使用在阈值修改后的地图上执行的确定性部分自避免步行。在这种方法中，如果它们之间的欧几里得距离小于$ \ sqrt {2} $，并且权重（其强度之间的差值）小于给定阈值，则该映射的两个像素是相邻的。通过使用不同的阈值获得的地图突出显示由确定性步行提取的图像的几个属性。为了组成特征向量，确定性步行以不同的阈值进行并且其统计被连接。因此，这种方法可以被认为是一个多尺度的分析。我们在Brodatz数据库上验证了我们的方法，该数据库是众所周知的公共图像数据库，并被纹理分析方法广泛使用。实验结果表明，提出的方法提出了一个很好的纹理鉴别，克服传统的纹理方法。
