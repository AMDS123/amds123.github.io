##### Abstract
Photorealistic style transfer aims to transfer the style of a reference photo onto a content photo naturally, such that the stylized image looks like a real photo taken by a camera. Existing state-of-the-art methods are prone to spatial structure distortion of the content image and global color inconsistency across different semantic objects, making the results less photorealistic. In this paper, we propose a one-shot mutual Dirichlet network, to address these challenging issues. The essential contribution of the work is the realization of a representation scheme that successfully decouples the spatial structure and color information of images, such that the spatial structure can be well preserved during stylization. This representation is discriminative and context-sensitive with respect to semantic objects. It is extracted with a shared sparse Dirichlet encoder. Moreover, such representation is encouraged to be matched between the content and style images for faithful color transfer. The affine-transfer model is embedded in the decoder of the network to facilitate the color transfer. The strong representative and discriminative power of the proposed network enables one-shot learning given only one content-style image pair. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method is able to generate photorealistic photos without spatial distortion or abrupt color changes.
