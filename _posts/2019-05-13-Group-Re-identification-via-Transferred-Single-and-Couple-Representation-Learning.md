##### Abstract
Group re-identification (G-ReID) is an important yet less-studied task. Its challenges not only lie in appearance changes of individuals which have been well-investigated in general person re-identification (ReID), but also derive from group layout and membership changes. So the key task of G-ReID is to learn representations robust to such changes. To address this issue, we propose a Transferred Single and Couple Representation Learning Network (TSCN). Its merits are two aspects: 1) Due to the lack of labelled training samples, existing G-ReID methods mainly rely on unsatisfactory hand-crafted features. To gain the superiority of deep learning models, we treat a group as multiple persons and transfer the domain of a labeled ReID dataset to a G-ReID target dataset style to learn single representations. 2) Taking into account the neighborhood relationship in a group, we further propose learning a novel couple representation between two group members, that achieves more discriminative power in G-ReID tasks. In addition, an unsupervised weight learning method is exploited to adaptively fuse the results of different views together according to result patterns. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach that significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods by 11.7\% CMC-1 on the Road Group dataset and by 39.0\% CMC-1 on the DukeMCMT dataset.
