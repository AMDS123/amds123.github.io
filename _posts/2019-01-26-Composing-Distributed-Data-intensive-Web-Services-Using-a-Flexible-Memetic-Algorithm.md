##### Abstract
Web Service Composition (WSC) is a particularly promising application of Web services, where multiple individual services with specific functionalities are composed to accomplish a more complex task, which must fulfil functional requirements and optimise Quality of Service (QoS) attributes, simultaneously. Additionally, large quantities of data, produced by technological advances, need to be exchanged between services. Data-intensive Web services, which manipulate and deal with those data, are of great interest to implement data-intensive processes, such as distributed Data-intensive Web Service Composition (DWSC). Researchers have proposed Evolutionary Computing (EC) fully-automated WSC techniques that meet all the above factors. Some of these works employed Memetic Algorithms (MAs) to enhance the performance of EC through increasing its exploitation ability of in searching neighbourhood area of a solution. However, those works are not efficient or effective. This paper proposes an MA-based approach to solving the problem of distributed DWSC in an effective and efficient manner. In particular, we develop an MA that hybridises EC with a flexible local search technique incorporating distance of services. An evaluation using benchmark datasets is carried out, comparing existing state-of-the-art methods. Results show that our proposed method has the highest quality and an acceptable execution time overall.
