##### Abstract
This paper considers the chattering problem of sliding mode control while delay in robot manipulator caused chaos in such electromechanical systems. Fractional calculus as a powerful theorem to produce a novel sliding mode; which has a dynamic essence is used for chattering elimination. To realize the control of a class of chaotic systems in master-slave configuration this novel fractional dynamic sliding mode control scheme is presented and examined on delay based chaotic robot in joint and work space. Also the stability of the closed-loop system is guaranteed by Lyapunov stability theory. Beside these, delayed robot motions are sorted out for qualitative and quantification study. Finally, numerical simulation example illustrates the feasibility of proposed control method.
