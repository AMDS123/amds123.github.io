##### Abstract
Process mining analyzes business processes based on events stored in event logs. However, some recorded events may correspond to activities on a very low level of abstraction. When events are recorded on a too low level of granularity, process discovery methods tend to generate overgeneralizing process models. Grouping low-level events to higher level activities, i.e., event abstraction, can be used to discover better process models. Existing event abstraction methods are mainly based on common sub-sequences and clustering techniques. In this paper, we propose to first discover local process models and then use those models to lift the event log to a higher level of abstraction. Our conjecture is that process models discovered on the obtained high-level event log return process models of higher quality: their fitness and precision scores are more balanced. We show this with preliminary results on several real-life event logs.

流程挖掘基于事件日志中存储的事件分析业务流程。然而，一些记录的事件可能对应于抽象程度非常低的活动。当事件记录的粒度太低时，过程发现方法倾向于生成过度泛化的过程模型。将低级别事件分组到较高级别的活动（即事件抽象）可用于发现更好的过程模型。现有的事件抽象方法主要基于共同的子序列和聚类技术。在本文中，我们建议首先发现本地过程模型，然后使用这些模型将事件日志提升到更高的抽象层次。我们的猜想是在得到的高质量事件日志回归过程模型中发现的过程模型，其质量和精度得分更加平衡。我们用几个真实事件日志的初步结果来展示这一点。
