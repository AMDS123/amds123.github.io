##### Abstract
Contours are salient features for image description, but the detection and localization of boundary contours is still considered a challenging problem. This paper introduces a new tool for edge processing implementing the Gestaltism idea of edge grouping. This tool is a mid-level image operator, called the Torque operator, that is designed to help detect closed contours in images. The torque operator takes as input the raw image and creates an image map by computing from the image gradients within regions of multiple sizes a measure of how well the edges are aligned to form closed convex contours. Fundamental properties of the torque are explored and illustrated through examples. Then it is applied in pure bottom-up processing in a variety of applications, including edge detection, visual attention and segmentation and experimentally demonstrated a useful tool that can improve existing techniques. Finally, its extension as a more general grouping mechanism and application in object recognition is discussed.

轮廓是图像描述的显着特征，但边界轮廓的检测和定位仍然是一个具有挑战性的问题。本文介绍了一种边缘处理的新工具，实现边缘分组的概念。该工具是一个中等级别的图像操作器，称为扭矩算子，用于帮助检测图像中的封闭轮廓。扭矩运算器将原始图像作为输入，并通过从多个尺寸的区域内的图像梯度计算边缘被对齐以形成闭合的凸轮廓的程度来创建图像映射。通过实例对扭矩的基本特性进行了探索和说明。然后将其应用于包括边缘检测，视觉注意和分割在内的各种应用的纯自底向上处理中，并通过实验证明了可以改进现有技术的有用工具。最后讨论了它的扩展作为更一般的分组机制和在物体识别中的应用。
