##### Abstract
Albeit the recent progress in single image 3D human pose estimation due to the convolutional neural network, it is still challenging to handle real scenarios such as highly occluded scenes. In this paper, we propose to address the problem of single image 3D human pose estimation with occluded measurements by exploiting the Euclidean distance matrix (EDM). Specifically, we present two approaches based on EDM, which could effectively handle occluded joints in 2D images. The first approach is based on 2D-to-2D distance matrix regression achieved by a simple CNN architecture. The second approach is based on sparse coding along with a learned over-complete dictionary. Experiments on the Human3.6M dataset show the excellent performance of these two approaches in recovering occluded observations and demonstrate the improvements in accuracy for 3D human pose estimation with occluded joints.

尽管由于卷积神经网络导致单图像3D人体姿态估计的最近进展，但是处理诸如高度遮挡的场景之类的真实场景仍然是具有挑战性的。在本文中，我们提出通过利用欧几里德距离矩阵（EDM）来解决具有遮挡测量的单图像3D人体姿态估计的问题。具体来说，我们提出了两种基于EDM的方法，它可以有效地处理2D​​图像中的遮挡关节。第一种方法基于通过简单CNN架构实现的2D到2D距离矩阵回归。第二种方法基于稀疏编码以及学习过度完整的字典。 Human3.6M数据集上的实验显示了这两种方法在恢复闭塞观察中的优异性能，并证明了具有闭塞关节的3D人体姿态估计的准确性的改进。
