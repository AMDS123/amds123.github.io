##### Abstract
Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) have made the real-time dense reconstruction possible increasing the prospects of navigation, tracking, and augmented reality problems. Some breakthroughs have been achieved in this regard during past few decades and more remarkable works are still going on. This paper presents an overview of SLAM approaches that have been developed till now. Kinect Fusion algorithm, its variants, and further developed approaches are discussed in detailed. The algorithms and approaches are compared for their effectiveness in tracking and mapping based on Root Mean Square error over online available datasets.

##### Abstract (translated by Google)
同时定位和映射（SLAM）使得实时密集重建可能增加导航，跟踪和增强现实问题的前景。在过去的几十年里，这方面取得了一些突破，更多的杰出工作仍在继续。本白皮书概述了迄今为止开发的SLAM方法。详细讨论了Kinect Fusion算法及其变体和进一步开发的方法。该算法和方法比较了它们在基于在线可用数据集的均方根误差的跟踪和映射方面的有效性。
