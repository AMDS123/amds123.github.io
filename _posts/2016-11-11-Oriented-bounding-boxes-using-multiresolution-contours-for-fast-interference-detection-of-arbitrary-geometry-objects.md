##### Abstract
Interference detection of arbitrary geometric objects is not a trivial task due to the heavy computational load imposed by implementation issues. The hierarchically structured bounding boxes help us to quickly isolate the contour of segments in interference. In this paper, a new approach is introduced to treat the interference detection problem involving the representation of arbitrary shaped objects. Our proposed method relies upon searching for the best possible way to represent contours by means of hierarchically structured rectangular oriented bounding boxes. This technique handles 2D objects boundaries defined by closed B-spline curves with roughness details. Each oriented box is adapted and fitted to the segments of the contour using second order statistical indicators from some elements of the segments of the object contour in a multiresolution framework. Our method is efficient and robust when it comes to 2D animations in real time. It can deal with smooth curves and polygonal approximations as well results are present to illustrate the performance of the new method.

对任意几何对象的干扰检测并不是一项微不足道的任务，因为实现问题带来了沉重的计算负担。分层结构的边界框帮助我们快速地隔离干涉中的分段轮廓。本文引入一种新的方法来处理涉及任意形状物体表示的干涉检测问题。我们提出的方法依赖于寻找最好的方式来表示轮廓通过层次结构的矩形方向包围盒。该技术处理由具有粗糙度细节的封闭B样条曲线定义的2D对象边界。使用来自多分辨率框架中的对象轮廓的片段的一些元素的二阶统计指示符，将每个定向框适配并适配到轮廓的片段。我们的方法在实时处理二维动画的时候非常高效和强大。它可以处理平滑的曲线和多边形近似以及结果来说明新方法的性能。
