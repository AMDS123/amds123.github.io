##### Abstract
In this paper, a fresh procedure to handle image mixtures by means of blind signal separation relying on a combination of second order and higher order statistics techniques are introduced. The problem of blind signal separation is reassigned to the wavelet domain. The key idea behind this method is that the image mixture can be decomposed into the sum of uncorrelated and/or independent sub-bands using wavelet transform. Initially, the observed image is pre-whitened in the space domain. Afterwards, an initial separation matrix is estimated from the second order statistics de-correlation model in the wavelet domain. Later, this matrix will be used as an initial separation matrix for the higher order statistics stage in order to find the best separation matrix. The suggested algorithm was tested using natural images.Experiments have confirmed that the use of the proposed process provides promising outcomes in identifying an image from noisy mixtures of images.

本文介绍了一种利用二阶和高阶统计技术相结合的盲信号分离处理图像混合的新方法。盲信号分离的问题被重新分配到小波域。该方法背后的关键思想是利用小波变换将图像混合分解为不相关和/或独立的子带之和。最初，观察的图像在空间域中被预先白化。之后，从小波域中的二阶统计量解相关模型估计初始分离矩阵。之后，这个矩阵将被用作更高阶统计阶段的初始分离矩阵，以便找到最佳分离矩阵。使用自然图像对所提出的算法进行测试。实验已经证实，使用所提出的过程为从噪声混合图像中识别图像提供了有希望的结果。
