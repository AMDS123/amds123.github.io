##### Abstract
Although, the fair amount of works in sentiment analysis (SA) and opinion mining (OM) systems in the last decade and with respect to the performance of these systems, but it still not desired performance, especially for morphologically-Rich Language (MRL) such as Arabic, due to the complexities and challenges exist in the nature of the languages itself. One of these challenges is the detection of idioms or proverbs phrases within the writer text or comment. An idiom or proverb is a form of speech or an expression that is peculiar to itself. Grammatically, it cannot be understood from the individual meanings of its elements and can yield different sentiment when treats as separate words. Consequently, In order to facilitate the task of detection and classification of lexical phrases for automated SA systems, this paper presents AIPSeLEX a novel idioms/ proverbs sentiment lexicon for modern standard Arabic (MSA) and colloquial. AIPSeLEX is manually collected and annotated at sentence level with semantic orientation (positive or negative). The efforts of manually building and annotating the lexicon are reported. Moreover, we build a classifier that extracts idioms and proverbs, phrases from text using n-gram and similarity measure methods. Finally, several experiments were carried out on various data, including Arabic tweets and Arabic microblogs (hotel reservation, product reviews, and TV program comments) from publicly available Arabic online reviews websites (social media, blogs, forums, e-commerce web sites) to evaluate the coverage and accuracy of AIPSeLEX.

尽管近十年来情绪分析（SA）和意见挖掘（OM）系统的工作量与这些系统的性能相当，但它仍不期望性能，特别是对形态丰富的语言（MRL）如阿拉伯文，因为语言本身的性质存在着复杂性和挑战性。其中一个挑战是在作者的文章或评论中检测成语或谚语短语。习语或谚语是一种特有的言语或表达形式。在语法上，它不能从其元素的个别意义上理解，而当作为单独的词语处理时，会产生不同的情感。因此，为了便于自动SA系统的词汇短语的检测和分类任务，本文提出了AIPSeLEX为现代标准阿拉伯语（MSA）和口语的新颖成语/谚语情感词典。人工收集AIPSeLEX并在语义层面（正面或负面）进行注释。报告手动建立和注释词典的努力。此外，我们建立一个分类器，使用n-gram和相似性度量方法从文本中提取成语和谚语，短语。最后，从公开可用的阿拉伯语在线评论网站（社交媒体，博客，论坛，电子商务网站）对各种数据进行了一些实验，包括阿拉伯语推文和阿拉伯微博（酒店预订，产品评论和电视节目评论）评估AIPSeLEX的覆盖范围和准确性。
