##### Abstract
Sports activities are an integral part of our day to day life. Introducing autonomous decision making and predictive models to recognize and analyze different sports events and activities has become an emerging trend in computer vision arena. Albeit the advances and vivid applications of artificial intelligence and computer vision in recognizing different popular western games, there remains a very minimal amount of efforts in the application of computer vision in recognizing traditional Bangladeshi games. We, in this paper, have described a novel Deep Learning based approach for recognizing traditional Bengali games. We have retrained the final layer of the renowned Inception V3 architecture developed by Google for our classification approach. Our approach shows promising results with an average accuracy of 80% approximately in correctly recognizing among 5 traditional Bangladeshi sports events.

体育活动是我们日常生活中不可或缺的一部分。引入自主决策和预测模型来识别和分析不同的体育赛事和活动已成为计算机视觉领域的新兴趋势。尽管人工智能和计算机视觉在识别不同的西方流行游戏方面取得了进步和生动的应用，但在识别传统的孟加拉国游戏中应用计算机视觉仍然只有极少的努力。在本文中，我们描述了一种基于深度学习的新方法，用于识别传统的孟加拉语游戏。我们重新研究了Google为我们的分类方法开发的着名的Inception V3架构的最后一层。我们的方法显示了有希望的结果，在5个传统的孟加拉国体育赛事中正确识别的平均准确率约为80％。
