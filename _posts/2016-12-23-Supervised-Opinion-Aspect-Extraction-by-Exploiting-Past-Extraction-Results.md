##### Abstract
One of the key tasks of sentiment analysis of product reviews is to extract product aspects or features that users have expressed opinions on. In this work, we focus on using supervised sequence labeling as the base approach to performing the task. Although several extraction methods using sequence labeling methods such as Conditional Random Fields (CRF) and Hidden Markov Models (HMM) have been proposed, we show that this supervised approach can be significantly improved by exploiting the idea of concept sharing across multiple domains. For example, "screen" is an aspect in iPhone, but not only iPhone has a screen, many electronic devices have screens too. When "screen" appears in a review of a new domain (or product), it is likely to be an aspect too. Knowing this information enables us to do much better extraction in the new domain. This paper proposes a novel extraction method exploiting this idea in the context of supervised sequence labeling. Experimental results show that it produces markedly better results than without using the past information.

产品评论情感分析的关键任务之一就是提取用户对其表达意见的产品方面或特征。在这项工作中，我们专注于使用监督序列标签作为执行任务的基本方法。尽管已经提出了几种使用序列标记方法（如条件随机场（CRF）和隐马尔可夫模型（HMM））的提取方法，但是我们表明，通过利用跨多个域的概念共享的思想，可以显着改善这种监督方法。例如，“屏幕”是iPhone中的一个方面，但不仅iPhone具有屏幕，许多电子设备也具有屏幕。当“屏幕”出现在对新域（或产品）的评论中时，它可能也是一个方面。了解这些信息使我们能够在新的领域提取更好的信息。本文提出了一种在监督序列标注的背景下利用这种思想的新颖提取方法。实验结果表明，它比没有使用过去的信息产生明显更好的结果。
