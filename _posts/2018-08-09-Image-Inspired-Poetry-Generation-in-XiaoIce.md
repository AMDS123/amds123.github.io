##### Abstract
Vision is a common source of inspiration for poetry. The objects and the sentimental imprints that one perceives from an image may lead to various feelings depending on the reader. In this paper, we present a system of poetry generation from images to mimic the process. Given an image, we first extract a few keywords representing objects and sentiments perceived from the image. These keywords are then expanded to related ones based on their associations in human written poems. Finally, verses are generated gradually from the keywords using recurrent neural networks trained on existing poems. Our approach is evaluated by human assessors and compared to other generation baselines. The results show that our method can generate poems that are more artistic than the baseline methods. This is one of the few attempts to generate poetry from images. By deploying our proposed approach, XiaoIce has already generated more than 12 million poems for users since its release in July 2017. A book of its poems has been published by Cheers Publishing, which claimed that the book is the first-ever poetry collection written by an AI in human history.

视觉是诗歌灵感的共同来源。人们从图像中感知的物体和感伤印记可能会根据读者产生各种感受。在本文中，我们从图像中提出了一个诗歌生成系统来模仿这个过程。给定图像，我们首先提取一些表示从图像中感知的对象和情感的关键字。然后根据这些关键词在人类书面诗中的关联，将这些关键词扩展为相关关键词。最后，使用在现有诗歌上训练的递归神经网络，从关键词逐渐产生经文。我们的方法由人类评估员进行评估，并与其他一代基线进行比较。结果表明，我们的方法可以产生比基线方法更具艺术性的诗歌。这是从图像中产生诗歌的少数尝试之一。通过部署我们提出的方法，自从2017年7月发布以来，小冰已经为用户创作了超过1200万首诗。由Cheers Publishing出版了一本诗集，声称这本书是有史以来第一本诗集。人类历史上的人工智能。
