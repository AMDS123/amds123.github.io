##### Abstract
Humans continuously adapt their style and language to a variety of domains. However, a reliable definition of `domain' has eluded researchers thus far. Additionally, the notion of discrete domains stands in contrast to the multiplicity of heterogeneous domains that humans navigate, many of which overlap. In order to better understand the change and variation of human language, we draw on research in domain adaptation and extend the notion of discrete domains to the continuous spectrum. We propose representation learning-based models that can adapt to continuous domains and detail how these can be used to investigate variation in language. To this end, we propose to use dialogue modeling as a test bed due to its proximity to language modeling and its social component.

人类在不同的领域不断调整自己的风格和语言。然而，到目前为止，“域”的可靠定义已经被研究者所忽略。此外，离散域的概念与人类导航的多重异构域形成对比，其中许多域重叠。为了更好地理解人类语言的变化和变化，我们借鉴了域的适应性研究，将离散域的概念延伸到了连续谱。我们提出了基于表示学习的模型，可以适应连续的领域，并详细说明如何使用这些模型来调查语言的变化。为此，我们建议使用对话建模作为测试平台，因为它接近语言建模及其社会组成部分。
