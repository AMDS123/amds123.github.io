##### Abstract
One of the drawbacks of frequent episode mining is that overwhelmingly many of the discovered patterns are redundant. Free-rider episode, as a typical example, consists of a real pattern doped with some additional noise events. Because of the possible high support of the inside noise events, such free-rider episodes may have abnormally high support that they cannot be filtered by frequency based framework. An effective technique for filtering free-rider episodes is using a partition model to divide an episode into two consecutive subepisodes and comparing the observed support of such episode with its expected support under the assumption that these two subepisodes occur independently. In this paper, we take more complex subepisodes into consideration and develop a novel partition model named EDP for free-rider episode filtering from a given set of episodes. It combines (1) a dual partition strategy which divides an episode to an underlying real pattern and potential noises; (2) a novel definition of the expected support of a free-rider episode based on the proposed partition strategy. We can deem the episode interesting if the observed support is substantially higher than the expected support estimated by our model. The experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate EDP can effectively filter free-rider episodes compared with existing state-of-the-arts.

频繁插曲挖掘的一个缺点是，绝大多数发现的模式都是多余的。作为一个典型例子，搭便车情节由一些掺杂了一些附加噪音事件的真实图案组成。由于内部噪声事件可能得到高度支持，这类搭便车事件可能会有异常高的支持，因此无法通过基于频率的框架进行过滤。一个有效的过滤free-rider情节的技术是使用分区模型将一个情节分成两个连续的子情节，并在这两个子情节独立发生的假设下将观察到的这种情节的支持与其预期支持进行比较。在本文中，我们考虑了更复杂的子节点，并开发了一个新的分区模型，名为EDP，用于从给定的一组节目中进行免费骑士情节过滤。它结合了（1）双重分割策略，将一个情节分为潜在的实际模式和潜在的噪音; （2）基于所提议的分区策略的对搭便车情节的预期支持的新定义。如果观察到的支持远高于我们模型估计的预期支持，我们可以认为这一情节有趣。对合成和现实世界数据集的实验表明，与现有技术水平相比，EDP可以有效地过滤搭便车事件。
