##### Abstract
This paper focuses on two key problems for audio-visual emotion recognition in the video. One is the audio and visual streams temporal alignment for feature level fusion. The other one is locating and re-weighting the perception attentions in the whole audio-visual stream for better recognition. The Long Short Term Memory Recurrent Neural Network (LSTM-RNN) is employed as the main classification architecture. Firstly, soft attention mechanism aligns the audio and visual streams. Secondly, seven emotion embedding vectors, which are corresponding to each classification emotion type, are added to locate the perception attentions. The locating and re-weighting process is also based on the soft attention mechanism. The experiment results on EmotiW2015 dataset and the qualitative analysis show the efficiency of the proposed two techniques.

本文重点介绍视频中视听情感识别的两个关键问题。一个是音频和视频流时间对齐功能级融合。另一个是在整个视听流中对感知的注意力进行定位和重新加权以获得更好的认知。长期短期记忆递归神经网络（LSTM-RNN）被用作主要分类体系结构。首先，软注意机制对齐音频和视频流。其次，添加7种与每个分类情感类型相对应的情感嵌入向量来定位感知注意力。定位和重新加权过程也是基于软性注意机制。 EmotiW2015数据集的实验结果和定性分析表明了两种技术的有效性。
