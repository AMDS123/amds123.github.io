##### Abstract
The self-similarity of Indonesian Borobudur Temple is observed through the dimensionality of stupa that is hypothetically closely related to whole architectural body. Fractal dimension is calculated by using the cube counting method and found that the dimension is 2.325, which is laid between the two-dimensional plane and three dimensional space. The applied fractal geometry and self-similarity of the building is emerged as the building process implement the metric rules, since there is no universal metric standard known in ancient traditional Javanese culture thus the architecture is not based on final master plan. The paper also proposes how the hypothetical algorithmic architecture might be applied computationally in order to see some experimental generations of similar building. The paper ends with some conjectures for further challenge and insights related to fractal geometry in Javanese traditional cultural heritages.

##### Abstract (translated by Google)
印度尼西亚婆罗浮屠寺庙的自相似性通过假想地与整个建筑身体密切相关的佛塔的维度被观察。利用立方体计数法计算分形维数，发现二维平面与三维空间之间的维数为2.325。由于建筑过程实施的是度量规则，所以建筑的应用分形几何和自相似性是由于在古代传统的爪哇文化中没有普遍的度量标准，因此建筑不是基于最终的总体规划。本文还提出如何计算应用假设的算法体系结构，以便看到类似建筑的一些实验代。本文最后对爪哇传统文化遗产中与分形几何有关的进一步挑战和见解进行了一些猜想。
