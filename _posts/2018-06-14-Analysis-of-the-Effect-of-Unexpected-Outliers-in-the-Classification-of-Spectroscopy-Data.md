##### Abstract
Multi-class classification algorithms are very widely used, but we argue that they are not always ideal from a theoretical perspective, because they assume all classes are characterized by the data, whereas in many applications, training data for some classes may be entirely absent, rare, or statistically unrepresentative. We evaluate one-sided classifiers as an alternative, since they assume that only one class (the target) is well characterized. We consider a task of identifying whether a substance contains a chlorinated solvent, based on its chemical spectrum. For this application, it is not really feasible to collect a statistically representative set of outliers, since that group may contain \emph{anything} apart from the target chlorinated solvents. Using a new one-sided classification toolkit, we compare a One-Sided k-NN algorithm with two well-known binary classification algorithms, and conclude that the one-sided classifier is more robust to unexpected outliers.

多类分类算法应用非常广泛，但我们认为从理论角度来看，它们并不总是理想的，因为它们假设所有类都以数据为特征，而在许多应用中，某些类的训练数据可能完全不存在，罕见或统计上不具代表性。我们评估单侧分类器是一种选择，因为他们认为只有一个类别（目标）具有良好的特征。我们考虑根据其化学谱来确定物质是否含有氯化溶剂。对于这种应用，收集一组具有统计学意义的异常值并不是真的可行，因为除了目标氯化溶剂之外，该组可能包含\ anyph {anything}。使用新的单侧分类工具包，我们将单边k-NN算法与两种众所周知的二元分类算法进行比较，并得出结论：单边分类器对于意想不到的异常值更加稳健。
