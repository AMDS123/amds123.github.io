##### Abstract
Since their inception, CNNs have utilized some type of striding operator to reduce the overlap of receptive fields and spatial dimensions. Although having clear heuristic motivations (i.e. lowering the number of parameters to learn) the mathematical role of striding within CNN learning remains unclear. This paper offers a novel and mathematical rigorous perspective on the role of the striding operator within modern CNNs. Specifically, we demonstrate theoretically that one can always represent a CNN that incorporates striding with an equivalent non-striding CNN which has more filters and smaller size. Through this equivalence we are then able to characterize striding as an additional mechanism for parameter sharing among channels, thus reducing training complexity. Finally, the framework presented in this paper offers a new mathematical perspective on the role of striding which we hope shall facilitate and simplify the future theoretical analysis of CNNs.

自成立以来，CNN利用某种跨步算子来减少接受域和空间维度的重叠。虽然有明确的启发式动机（即降低学习参数的数量）跨越CNN学习的数学作用仍不清楚。本文对现代有线电视网络中跨步运算符的作用提供了一种新颖的，数学的严谨的视角。具体来说，我们从理论上证明，我们可以总是代表一个CNN，它包含了跨越等值的非跨步CNN，跨越更多的过滤器和更小的尺寸。通过这种等价性，我们可以将步长描述为通道之间参数共享的附加机制，从而减少训练的复杂性。最后，本文提出的框架提供了一个新的数学观点，我们希望能够促进和简化CNN未来的理论分析。
