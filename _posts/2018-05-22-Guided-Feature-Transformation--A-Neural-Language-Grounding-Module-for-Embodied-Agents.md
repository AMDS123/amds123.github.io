##### Abstract
Recently there has been a rising interest in training agents, embodied in virtual environments, to perform language-directed tasks by deep reinforcement learning. In this paper, we propose a simple but effective neural language grounding module for embodied agents that can be trained end to end from scratch taking raw pixels, unstructured linguistic commands, and sparse rewards as the inputs. We model the language grounding process as a language-guided transformation of visual features, where latent sentence embeddings are used as the transformation matrices. In several language-directed navigation tasks that feature challenging partial observation and require simple reasoning, our module significantly outperforms the state of the arts. We also release XWORLD 3D, an easy-to-customize 3D environment that can potentially be modified to evaluate a variety of embodied agents.

最近，在虚拟环境中体现的培训代理人对通过深入强化学习执行语言指导任务的兴趣不断增加。在本文中，我们提出了一个简单而有效的神经语言接地模块，用于体现代理，可以从头开始对原始像素，非结构化语言命令和稀疏奖励作为输入进行端对端训练。我们将语言接地过程建模为视觉特征的语言导向转换，其中将潜在语句嵌入用作转换矩阵。在几种语言指导的导航任务中，具有挑战性的局部观察并且需要简单的推理，我们的模块显着优于艺术状态。我们还发布了XWORLD 3D，这是一种易于定制的3D环境，可以对其进行修改，以评估各种嵌入式代理。
