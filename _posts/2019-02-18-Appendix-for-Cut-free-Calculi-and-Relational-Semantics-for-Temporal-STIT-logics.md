##### Abstract
This paper is an appendix to the paper "Cut-free Calculi and Relational Semantics for Temporal STIT logics" by Berkel and Lyon, 2019. It provides the completeness proof for the basic STIT logic Ldm (relative to irreflexive, temporal Kripke STIT frames) as well as gives the derivation of the independence of agents axiom for the logic Xstit.
