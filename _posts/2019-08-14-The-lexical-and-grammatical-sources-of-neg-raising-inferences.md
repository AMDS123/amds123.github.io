##### Abstract
We investigate neg(ation)-raising inferences, wherein negation on a predicate can be interpreted as though in that predicate's subordinate clause. To do this, we collect a large-scale dataset of neg-raising judgments for effectively all English clause-embedding verbs and develop a model to jointly induce the semantic types of verbs and their subordinate clauses and the relationship of these types to neg-raising inferences. We find that some neg-raising inferences are attributable to properties of particular predicates, while others are attributable to subordinate clause structure.
