##### Abstract
In this paper, we propose a novel encoder-decoder neural network model referred to as DeepBinaryMask for video compressive sensing. In video compressive sensing one frame is acquired using a set of coded masks (sensing matrix) from which a number of video frames is reconstructed, equal to the number of coded masks. The proposed framework is an end-to-end model where the sensing matrix is trained along with the video reconstruction. The encoder learns the binary elements of the sensing matrix and the decoder is trained to recover the unknown video sequence. The reconstruction performance is found to improve when using the trained sensing mask from the network as compared to other mask designs such as random, across a wide variety of compressive sensing reconstruction algorithms. Finally, our analysis and discussion offers insights into understanding the characteristics of the trained mask designs that lead to the improved reconstruction quality.

在本文中，我们提出了一种被称为DeepBinaryMask的视频压缩感知的编码器 - 解码器神经网络模型。在视频压缩感测中，使用一组编码的掩模（感测矩阵）来获取一帧，其中重构的视频帧的数量等于编码的掩模的数量。所提出的框架是端到端模型，其中感测矩阵随着视频重建而被训练。编码器学习感测矩阵的二进制元素，并且解码器被训练以恢复未知的视频序列。与各种各样的压缩感测重建算法中的随机等掩模设计相比，当使用来自网络的训练过的感测掩模时，发现重构性能得到改善。最后，我们的分析和讨论为理解经过训练的面罩设计的特性提供了深刻的见解，从而提高了重建质量。
