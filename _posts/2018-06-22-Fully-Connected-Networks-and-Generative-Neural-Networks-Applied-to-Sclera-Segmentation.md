##### Abstract
Due to the world's demand for security systems, biometrics can be seen as an important topic of research in computer vision. One of the biometric forms that has been gaining attention is the recognition based on sclera. The initial and paramount step for performing this type of recognition is the segmentation of the region of interest, i.e. the sclera. In this context, two approaches for such task based on the Fully Connected Network (FCN) and on Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) are introduced in this work. FCN is similar to a common convolution neural network, however the fully connected layers (i.e., the classification layers) are removed from the end of the network and the output is generated by combining the output of pooling layers from different convolutional ones. The GAN is based on the game theory, where we have two networks competing with each other to generate the best segmentation. In order to perform fair comparison with baselines and quantitative and objective evaluations of the proposed approaches, we provide to the scientific community new 1,300 manually segmented images from two databases. The experiments are performed on the UBIRIS.v2 and MICHE databases and the best performing configurations of our propositions achieved F-score's measures of 87.48% and 88.32%, respectively.

由于全球对安全系统的需求，生物识别技术可被视为计算机视觉研究的重要课题。一种引起注意的生物特征形式是基于巩膜的识别。进行这种类型识别的最初和最重要的步骤是分割感兴趣的区域，即巩膜。在此背景下，本文介绍了基于完全连接网络（FCN）和生成敌对网络（GAN）的两种方法。 FCN类似于常见的卷积神经网络，然而完全连接的层（即分类层）从网络的末端被移除并且通过组合来自不同卷积层的输出层来产生输出。 GAN基于博弈论，我们有两个网络彼此竞争以产生最佳分割。为了与基线进行公平的比较以及对提出的方法进行定量和客观的评估，我们向科学界提供了来自两个数据库的新的1,300个手动分割图像。这些实验在UBIRIS.v2和MICHE数据库上进行，我们命题的最佳表现配置分别实现了F分数的87.48％和88.32％。
