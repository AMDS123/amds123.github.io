##### Abstract
Sentiment analysis on user reviews helps to keep track of user reactions towards products, and make advices to users about what to buy. State-of-the-art review-level sentiment classification techniques could give pretty good precisions of above 90%. However, current phrase-level sentiment analysis approaches might only give sentiment polarity labelling precisions of around 70%~80%, which is far from satisfaction and restricts its application in many practical tasks. In this paper, we focus on the problem of phrase-level sentiment polarity labelling and attempt to bridge the gap between phrase-level and review-level sentiment analysis. We investigate the inconsistency between the numerical star ratings and the sentiment orientation of textual user reviews. Although they have long been treated as identical, which serves as a basic assumption in previous work, we find that this assumption is not necessarily true. We further propose to leverage the results of review-level sentiment classification to boost the performance of phrase-level polarity labelling using a novel constrained convex optimization framework. Besides, the framework is capable of integrating various kinds of information sources and heuristics, while giving the global optimal solution due to its convexity. Experimental results on both English and Chinese reviews show that our framework achieves high labelling precisions of up to 89%, which is a significant improvement from current approaches.

对用户评论的情感分析有助于跟踪用户对产品的反应，并向用户提供有关购买什么的建议。最先进的评论级情感分类技术可以给出90％以上的相当好的精度。然而，目前的短语情感分析方法只能给出约70％〜80％的情感极性标注精度，远远不能令人满意，限制了其在许多实际任务中的应用。本文主要研究短语级情感极性标注问题，并试图弥合短语级和评论级情感分析之间的差距。我们调查了数字星级和文本用户评论的情感倾向之间的不一致性。虽然他们长期以来一直被认为是相同的，这在以前的工作中是一个基本的假设，但是我们发现这个假设并不一定是正确的。我们进一步提出利用评论级情感分类的结果来提高短语级极性标签的性能，使用一种新颖的约束凸优化框架。此外，该框架能够整合各种信息源和启发式，同时由于其凸性给出全局最优解。中英文评论的实验结果表明，我们的框架实现了高达89％的高标签精度，这是目前方法的一个重大改进。
