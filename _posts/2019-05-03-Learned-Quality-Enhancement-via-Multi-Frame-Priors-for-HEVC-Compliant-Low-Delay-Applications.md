##### Abstract
Networked video applications, e.g., video conferencing, often suffer from poor visual quality due to unexpected network fluctuation and limited bandwidth. In this paper, we have developed a Quality Enhancement Network (QENet) to reduce the video compression artifacts, leveraging the spatial and temporal priors generated by respective multi-scale convolutions spatially and warped temporal predictions in a recurrent fashion temporally. We have integrated this QENet as a standard-alone post-processing subsystem to the High Efficiency Video Coding (HEVC) compliant decoder. Experimental results show that our QENet demonstrates the state-of-the-art performance against default in-loop filters in HEVC and other deep learning based methods with noticeable objective gains in Peak-Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) and subjective gains visually.
