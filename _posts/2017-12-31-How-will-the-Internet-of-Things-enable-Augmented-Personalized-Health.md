##### Abstract
Internet-of-Things (IoT) is profoundly redefining the way we create, consume, and share information. Health aficionados and citizens are increasingly using IoT technologies to track their sleep, food intake, activity, vital body signals, and other physiological observations. This is complemented by IoT systems that continuously collect health-related data from the environment and inside the living quarters. Together, these have created an opportunity for a new generation of healthcare solutions. However, interpreting data to understand an individual's health is challenging. It is usually necessary to look at that individual's clinical record and behavioral information, as well as social and environmental information affecting that individual. Interpreting how well a patient is doing also requires looking at his adherence to respective health objectives, application of relevant clinical knowledge and the desired outcomes. 
 We resort to the vision of Augmented Personalized Healthcare (APH) to exploit the extensive variety of relevant data and medical knowledge using Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques to extend and enhance human health to presents various stages of augmented health management strategies: self-monitoring, self-appraisal, self-management, intervention, and disease progress tracking and prediction. kHealth technology, a specific incarnation of APH, and its application to Asthma and other diseases are used to provide illustrations and discuss alternatives for technology-assisted health management. Several prominent efforts involving IoT and patient-generated health data (PGHD) with respect converting multimodal data into actionable information (big data to smart data) are also identified. Roles of three components in an evidence-based semantic perception approach- Contextualization, Abstraction, and Personalization are discussed.

物联网（IoT）正在深刻地重新定义我们创造，消费和分享信息的方式。健康爱好者和公民越来越多地使用物联网技术来追踪他们的睡眠，食物摄取，活动，重要的身体信号和其他生理学观察。物联网系统不断从环境和生活区内收集与健康有关的数据。这些共同为新一代医疗保健解决方案创造了机会。但是，解读数据以理解个人的健康是具有挑战性的。通常有必要查看个人的临床记录和行为信息，以及影响该个人的社会和环境信息。解释病人做得如何也需要看他遵守各自的健康目标，相关临床知识的应用和期望的结果。
 我们诉诸增强个性化医疗（APH）的愿景，利用人工智能（AI）技术广泛的相关数据和医学知识来扩展和增强人体健康，呈现增强健康管理策略的各个阶段：自我监控，自我评估，自我管理，干预和疾病进展跟踪和预测。 kHealth技术是APH的一个具体化身，它在哮喘和其他疾病中的应用被用来提供插图和讨论技术辅助的健康管理的替代方案。还确定了涉及物联网和患者生成的健康数据（PGHD）在将多模式数据转换为可操作信息（大数据到智能数据）方面的若干突出努力。三个组件在基于证据的语义感知方法中的角色 - 上下文化，抽象和个性化进行了讨论。
