##### Abstract
An accurate and reliable image based fruit detection system is critical for supporting higher level agriculture tasks such as yield mapping and robotic harvesting. This paper presents the use of a state-of-the-art object detection framework, Faster R-CNN, in the context of fruit detection in orchards, including mangoes, almonds and apples. Ablation studies are presented to better understand the practical deployment of the detection network, including how much training data is required to capture variability in the dataset. Data augmentation techniques are shown to yield significant performance gains, resulting in a greater than two-fold reduction in the number of training images required. In contrast, transferring knowledge between orchards contributed to negligible performance gain over initialising the Deep Convolutional Neural Network directly from ImageNet features. Finally, to operate over orchard data containing between 100-1000 fruit per image, a tiling approach is introduced for the Faster R-CNN framework. The study has resulted in the best yet detection performance for these orchards relative to previous works, with an F1-score of >0.9 achieved for apples and mangoes.

一个准确可靠的基于图像的水果检测系统对于支持更高水平的农业任务（如产量测绘和机器人采集）至关重要。本文介绍了在包括芒果，杏仁和苹果在内的果园检测水果的情况下，使用最先进的对象检测框架Raster CNN。提供消融研究是为了更好地理解检测网络的实际部署，包括需要多少训练数据来捕获数据集中的可变性。数据增强技术可显着提高性能，从而使所需训练图像的数量减少两倍以上。相比之下，在果园之间传递知识对于直接从ImageNet特性初始化深度卷积神经网络的性能增益可以忽略不计。最后，为了在每幅图像中包含100-1000个果实的果园数据进行操作，R-CNN框架采用了拼贴方法。与以前的作品相比，这项研究为这些果园提供了最好的检测性能，苹果和芒果的F1得分> 0.9。
