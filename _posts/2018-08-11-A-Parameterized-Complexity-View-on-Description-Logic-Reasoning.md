##### Abstract
Description logics are knowledge representation languages that have been designed to strike a balance between expressivity and computational tractability. Many different description logics have been developed, and numerous computational problems for these logics have been studied for their computational complexity. However, essentially all complexity analyses of reasoning problems for description logics use the one-dimensional framework of classical complexity theory. The multi-dimensional framework of parameterized complexity theory is able to provide a much more detailed image of the complexity of reasoning problems. 
 In this paper we argue that the framework of parameterized complexity has a lot to offer for the complexity analysis of description logic reasoning problems---when one takes a progressive and forward-looking view on parameterized complexity tools. We substantiate our argument by means of three case studies. The first case study is about the problem of concept satisfiability for the logic ALC with respect to nearly acyclic TBoxes. The second case study concerns concept satisfiability for ALC concepts parameterized by the number of occurrences of union operators and the number of occurrences of full existential quantification. The third case study offers a critical look at data complexity results from a parameterized complexity point of view. These three case studies are representative for the wide range of uses for parameterized complexity methods for description logic problems.

描述逻辑是知识表示语言，旨在在表达性和计算易处理性之间取得平衡。已经开发了许多不同的描述逻辑，并且已经针对这些逻辑的计算复杂性研究了许多计算问题。然而，对描述逻辑的推理问题的所有复杂性分析基本上都使用了经典复杂性理论的一维框架。参数化复杂性理论的多维框架能够提供更加详细的推理问题复杂性图像。
 在本文中，我们认为参数化复杂性的框架可以为描述逻辑推理问题的复杂性分析提供很多东西 - 当人们对参数化复杂性工具采取渐进和前瞻性的观点时。我们通过三个案例研究证实了我们的观点。第一个案例研究是关于几乎非循环TBox的逻辑ALC的概念可满足性问题。第二个案例研究涉及ALC概念的概念可满足性，该概念由联合算子的出现次数和完全存在量化的出现次数参数化。第三个案例研究从参数化复杂性的角度对数据复杂性结果进行了批判性研究。这三个案例研究代表了描述逻辑问题的参数化复杂性方法的广泛用途。
