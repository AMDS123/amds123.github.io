##### Abstract
Although much effort has recently been devoted to training high-quality sentence embeddings, we still have a poor understanding of what they are capturing. "Downstream" tasks, often based on sentence classification, are commonly used to evaluate the quality of sentence representations. The complexity of the tasks makes it however difficult to infer what kind of information is present in the representations. We introduce here 10 probing tasks designed to capture simple linguistic features of sentences, and we use them to study embeddings generated by three different encoders trained in eight distinct ways, uncovering intriguing properties of both encoders and training methods.

尽管最近致力于培训高质量的句子嵌入，但我们仍然对他们所捕捉的内容缺乏了解。通常基于句子分类的“下游”任务通常用于评估句子表示的质量。任务的复杂性使得很难推断出表示中出现了什么样的信息。我们在这里介绍10个旨在捕捉句子简单语言特征的探测任务，我们用它们来研究由三种不同编码器产生的嵌入，这些编码器以八种不同的方式进行训练，揭示了编码器和训练方法的有趣特性。
