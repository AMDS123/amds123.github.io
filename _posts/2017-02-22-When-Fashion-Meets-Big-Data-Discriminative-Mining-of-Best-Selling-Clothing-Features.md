##### Abstract
With the prevalence of e-commence websites and the ease of online shopping, consumers are embracing huge amounts of various options in products. Undeniably, shopping is one of the most essential activities in our society and studying consumer's shopping behavior is important for the industry as well as sociology and psychology. Indisputable, one of the most popular e-commerce categories is clothing business. There arises the needs for analysis of popular and attractive clothing features which could further boost many emerging applications, such as clothing recommendation and advertising. In this work, we design a novel system that consists of three major components: 1) exploring and organizing a large-scale clothing dataset from a online shopping website, 2) pruning and extracting images of best-selling products in clothing item data and user transaction history, and 3) utilizing a machine learning based approach to discovering fine-grained clothing attributes as the representative and discriminative characteristics of popular clothing style elements. Through the experiments over a large-scale online clothing shopping dataset, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed system, and obtain useful insights on clothing consumption trends and profitable clothing features.

随着电子商务网站的普及和网上购物的便利，消费者正在拥抱大量的各种产品选择。不可否认，购物是我们社会最重要的活动之一，研究消费者的购物行为对于行业以及社会学和心理学都是非常重要的。无可争议的，最流行的电子商务类别之一是服装业务。出现了分析流行的和有吸引力的服装特征的需求，这可能会进一步推动许多新兴的应用，例如服装推荐和广告。在这项工作中，我们设计了一个由三个主要部分组成的新颖的系统：1）从一个在线购物网站探索并组织一个大型服装数据集; 2）在服装项目数据和用户中修剪和提取最畅销产品的图像交易历史，以及3）利用基于机器学习的方法来发现细粒度服装属性作为流行服装风格元素的代表性和区别性特征。通过对大型在线服装购物数据集的实验，证明了我们提出的系统的有效性，并获得了有关服装消费趋势和有利可图的服装特征的有用见解。
