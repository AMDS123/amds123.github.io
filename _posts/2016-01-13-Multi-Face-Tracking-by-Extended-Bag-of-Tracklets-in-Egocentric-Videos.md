##### Abstract
Wearable cameras offer a hands-free way to record egocentric images of daily experiences, where social events are of special interest. The first step towards detection of social events is to track the appearance of multiple persons involved in it. In this paper, we propose a novel method to find correspondences of multiple faces in low temporal resolution egocentric videos acquired through a wearable camera. This kind of photo-stream imposes additional challenges to the multi-tracking problem with respect to conventional videos. Due to the free motion of the camera and to its low temporal resolution, abrupt changes in the field of view, in illumination condition and in the target location are highly frequent. To overcome such difficulties, we propose a multi-face tracking method that generates a set of tracklets through finding correspondences along the whole sequence for each detected face and takes advantage of the tracklets redundancy to deal with unreliable ones. Similar tracklets are grouped into the so called extended bag-of-tracklets (eBoT), which is aimed to correspond to a specific person. Finally, a prototype tracklet is extracted for each eBoT, where the occurred occlusions are estimated by relying on a new measure of confidence. We validated our approach over an extensive dataset of egocentric photo-streams and compared it to state of the art methods, demonstrating its effectiveness and robustness.

可穿戴相机提供了一种免提方式来记录日常经验的自我中心图像，在这些社交事件中特别感兴趣。追踪社交活动的第一步是跟踪涉及多人的外表。在本文中，我们提出了一种新颖的方法来寻找通过可穿戴相机获取的低时间分辨率的以自我为中心的视频中的多个人脸的对应关系。这种类型的照片流对传统视频的多重追踪问题提出了额外的挑战。由于摄像机的自由运动及其低时间分辨率，视场，照明条件和目标位置的突然变化是非常频繁的。为了克服这些困难，我们提出了一种多人脸跟踪方法，通过查找每个检测到的人脸的整个序列的对应关系来生成一组tracklets，并利用tracklets冗余来处理不可靠的人脸。类似的tracklets被分组到所谓的扩展的tracklets（eBoT）中，其旨在对应于特定的人。最后，为每个eBoT提取原型轨迹，其中通过依赖新的置信度来估计发生的遮挡。我们通过广泛的自我中心照片流数据集验证了我们的方法，并将其与最先进的方法相比较，证明了其有效性和稳健性。
