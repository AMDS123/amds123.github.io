##### Abstract
In this work, we present an approach for mining user preferences and recommendation based on reviews. There have been various studies worked on recommendation problem. However, most of the studies beyond one aspect user generated- content such as user ratings, user feedback and so on to state user preferences. There is a prob- lem in one aspect mining is lacking for stating user preferences. As a demonstration, in collaborative filter recommendation, we try to figure out the preference trend of crowded users, then use that trend to predict current user preference. Therefore, there is a gap between real user preferences and the trend of the crowded people. Additionally, user preferences can be addressed from mining user reviews since user often comment about various aspects of products. To solve this problem, we mainly focus on mining product aspects and user aspects inside user reviews to directly state user preferences. We also take into account Social Network Analysis for cold-start item problem. With cold-start user problem, collaborative filter algorithm is employed in our work. The framework is general enough to be applied to different recommendation domains. Theoretically, our method would achieve a significant enhancement.

在这项工作中，我们提出了一种基于评论挖掘用户偏好和推荐的方法。对推荐问题进行了各种研究。然而，大多数研究超出一个方面的用户生成 - 内容，如用户评级，用户反馈等，以声明用户的偏好。在一个方面，缺乏挖掘用户偏好的问题。作为论证，在协同过滤推荐中，我们试图找出拥挤用户的偏好趋势，然后用这个趋势来预测当前的用户偏好。因此，真实的用户偏好与拥挤的人群之间存在差距。另外，由于用户经常评论产品的各个方面，因此可以从挖掘用户评论中解决用户偏好。为了解决这个问题，我们主要关注于挖掘用户评论中的产品方面和用户方面，直接陈述用户偏好。我们还考虑到冷启动项目问题的社交网络分析。针对冷启动用户问题，本文采用协同过滤算法。该框架足够普遍适用于不同的推荐领域。从理论上讲，我们的方法会大大提高。
