##### Abstract
The strain of GaN layers grown by Metal Organic Chemical Vapor Deposition (MOCVD) on three vicinal 4H-SiC substrates (0, 3.4 and 8 offcut from [0001] towards [11-20] axis) is investigated by X-ray Diffraction (XRD), Raman Scattering and Cathodoluminescence (CL). The strain relaxation mechanisms are analyzed for each miscut angle. At a microscopic scale, the GaN layer grown on on-axis substrate has a slight and homogeneous tensile in-plane stress due to a uniform distribution of threading dislocations over the whole surface. The GaN layers grown on miscut substrates presented cracks, separating areas which have a stronger tensile in-plane stress but a more elastic strain. The plastic relaxation mechanisms involved in these layers are attributed to the step flow growth on misoriented surfaces (dislocations and stacking faults) and to the macroscopical plastic release of additional thermoelastic stress upon cooling down (cracks).
