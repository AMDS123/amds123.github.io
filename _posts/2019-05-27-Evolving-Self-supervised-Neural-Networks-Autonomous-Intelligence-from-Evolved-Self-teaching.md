##### Abstract
This paper presents a technique called evolving self-supervised neural networks - neural networks that can teach themselves, intrinsically motivated, without external supervision or reward. The proposed method presents some sort-of paradigm shift, and differs greatly from both traditional gradient-based learning and evolutionary algorithms in that it combines the metaphor of evolution and learning, more specifically self-learning, together, rather than treating these phenomena alternatively. I simulate a multi-agent system in which neural networks are used to control autonomous foraging agents with little domain knowledge. Experimental results show that only evolved self-supervised agents can demonstrate some sort of intelligent behaviour, but not evolution or self-learning alone. Indications for future work on evolving intelligence are also presented.
