##### Abstract
Deep learning techniques lie at the heart of several significant AI advances in recent years including object recognition and detection, image captioning, machine translation, speech recognition and synthesis, and playing the game of Go. Automated first-order theorem provers can aid in the formalization and verification of mathematical theorems and play a crucial role in program analysis, theory reasoning, security, interpolation, and system verification. Here we suggest deep learning based guidance in the proof search of the theorem prover E. We train and compare several deep neural network models on the traces of existing ATP proofs of Mizar statements and use them to select processed clauses during proof search. We give experimental evidence that with a hybrid, two-phase approach, deep learning based guidance can significantly reduce the average number of proof search steps while increasing the number of theorems proved. Using a few proof guidance strategies that leverage deep neural networks, we have found first-order proofs of 7.36% of the first-order logic translations of the Mizar Mathematical Library theorems that did not previously have ATP generated proofs. This increases the ratio of statements in the corpus with ATP generated proofs from 56% to 59%.

深度学习技术是近年来几项重大人工智能进步的核心，包括物体识别和检测，图像字幕，机器翻译，语音识别和合成，以及玩Go游戏。自动一阶定理证明可以帮助数学定理的形式化和验证，并在程序分析，理论推理，安全性，插值和系统验证中发挥关键作用。在这里，我们建议在定理证明器E的证明搜索中基于深度学习的指导。我们在Mizar语句的现有ATP证明的痕迹上训练和比较几个深度神经网络模型，并使用它们在证明搜索期间选择处理的子句。我们给出了实验证据，即采用混合两阶段方法，基于深度学习的指导可以显着减少证明搜索步骤的平均数量，同时增加证明的定理数量。使用一些利用深度神经网络的证明指导策略，我们发现了以前没有ATP生成证明的Mizar数学库定理的一阶逻辑翻译的7.36％的一阶证明。这增加了语料库中的语句与ATP生成的证据的比率从56％到59％。
