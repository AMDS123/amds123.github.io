##### Abstract
A novel cognition-inspired, agnostic framework is proposed for building maps in mobile robotics that are efficient in terms of image matching/retrieval for solving Visual Place Recognition (VPR) problem. A dataset, 'ESSEX3IN1', is also presented to demonstrate the significantly enhanced performance of state-of-the-art VPR techniques when combined with the proposed framework.
