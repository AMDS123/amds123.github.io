##### Abstract
Getting an overview over the legal domain has become challenging, especially in a broad, international context. Legal question answering systems have the potential to alleviate this task by automatically retrieving relevant legal texts for a specific statement and checking whether the meaning of the statement can be inferred from the found documents. We investigate a combination of the BM25 scoring method of Elasticsearch with word embeddings trained on English translations of the German and Japanese civil law. For this, we define criteria which select a dynamic number of relevant documents according to threshold scores. Exploiting two deep learning classifiers and their respective prediction bias with a threshold-based answer inclusion criterion has shown to be beneficial for the textual entailment task, when compared to the baseline.
