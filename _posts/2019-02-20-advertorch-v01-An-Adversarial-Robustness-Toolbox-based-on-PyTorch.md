##### Abstract
advertorch is a toolbox for adversarial robustness research. It contains various implementations for attacks, defenses and robust training methods. advertorch is built on PyTorch (Paszke et al., 2017), and leverages the advantages of the dynamic computational graph to provide concise and efficient reference implementations. The code is licensed under the LGPL license and is open sourced at https://github.com/BorealisAI/advertorch .
