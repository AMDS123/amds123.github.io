##### Abstract
We analyzed historical and literary documents in Chinese to gain insights into research issues, and overview our studies which utilized four different sources of text materials in this paper. We investigated the history of concepts and transliterated words in China with the Database for the Study of Modern China Thought and Literature, which contains historical documents about China between 1830 and 1930. We also attempted to disambiguate names that were shared by multiple government officers who served between 618 and 1912 and were recorded in Chinese local gazetteers. To showcase the potentials and challenges of computer-assisted analysis of Chinese literatures, we explored some interesting yet non-trivial questions about two of the Four Great Classical Novels of China: (1) Which monsters attempted to consume the Buddhist monk Xuanzang in the Journey to the West (JTTW), which was published in the 16th century, (2) Which was the most powerful monster in JTTW, and (3) Which major role smiled the most in the Dream of the Red Chamber, which was published in the 18th century. Similar approaches can be applied to the analysis and study of modern documents, such as the newspaper articles published about the 228 incident that occurred in 1947 in Taiwan.

##### Abstract (translated by Google)
我们分析了中文历史和文学文献，以深入研究问题，并概述我们的研究，在本文中利用了四种不同的文本资料来源。我们用现代中国思想文学研究数据库调查了中国概念和音译的历史，其中包含了1830  -  1930年间中国的有关中国的历史文献。我们还试图消除多名政府官员共享的姓名在618年到1912年之间，并记录在中国地方志。为了展示中国文学计算机辅助分析的潜力和挑战，我们探讨了中国四大古典小说中两个有趣但不平凡的问题：（1）哪些怪物试图在旅途中消耗玄Buddhist （JTTW）;（2）JTTW中最强大的怪物;（3）“红楼梦”中最主要的角色。 18世纪。现代文献的分析研究也可以采用类似的方法，如发表于1947年台湾的228事件的报刊文章。
