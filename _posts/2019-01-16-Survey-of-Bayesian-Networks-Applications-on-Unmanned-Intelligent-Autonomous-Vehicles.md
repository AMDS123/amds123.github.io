##### Abstract
This article review the applications of Bayesian networks on Unmanned Intelligent Autonomous Vehicles (UIAV) from the decision making point of view, which represents the final step for fully autonomous unmanned vehicles (currently under discussion). Until now when it comes to make high level decisions for unmanned autonomous vehicles (UAV) the humans have the last word. Based on the works exposed in this article and current analysis, the modules of a general decision making framework and its variables are inferred. Many efforts have been made in the labs showing Bayesian networks as a promising computer model for decision making. Remains for the future to test Bayesian networks models in real situations. Besides the applications, Bayesian networks fundaments are introduced as elements to consider when we try to develop (UIAVs) with the potential of achieving high level judgements.
