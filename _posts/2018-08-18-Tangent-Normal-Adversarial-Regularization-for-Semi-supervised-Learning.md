##### Abstract
The ever-increasing size of modern datasets combined with the difficulty of obtaining label information has made semi-supervised learning of significant practical importance in modern machine learning applications. Compared with supervised learning, the key difficulty in semi-supervised learning is how to make full use of the unlabeled data. In order to utilize manifold information provided by unlabeled data, we propose a novel regularization called the tangent-normal adversarial regularization, which is composed by two parts. The two terms complement with each other and jointly enforce the smoothness along two different directions that are crucial for semi-supervised learning. One is applied along the tangent space of the data manifold, aiming to enforce local invariance of the classifier on the manifold, while the other is performed on the normal space orthogonal to the tangent space, intending to impose robustness on the classifier against the noise causing the observed data deviating from the underlying data manifold. Both of the two regularizers are achieved by the strategy of virtual adversarial training. Our method has achieved state-of-the-art performance on semi-supervised learning tasks on both artificial dataset and FashionMNIST dataset.

现代数据集的不断增加的大小与获得标签信息的难度相结合，使得半监督学习在现代机器学习应用中具有重要的实际意义。与监督学习相比，半监督学习的关键难点在于如何充分利用未标记的数据。为了利用未标记数据提供的流形信息，我们提出了一种称为正切正规对偶正则化的新型正则化，它由两部分组成。这两个术语相互补充，共同强化了对半监督学习至关重要的两个不同方向的平滑性。一个沿着数据流形的切线空间应用，旨在强制分流器在流形上的局部不变性，而另一个在与切线空间正交的正常空间上执行，旨在对分类器施加鲁棒性以抵抗引起的噪声。观察到的数据偏离基础数据流形。两个正规化者都是通过虚拟对抗训练策略实现的。我们的方法在人工数据集和FashionMNIST数据集上实现了半监督学习任务的最先进性能。
