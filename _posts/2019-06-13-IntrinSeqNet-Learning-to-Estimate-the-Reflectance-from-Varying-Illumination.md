##### Abstract
Intrinsic image decomposition describes an image based on its reflectance and shading components. In this paper we tackle the problem of estimating the diffuse reflectance from a sequence of images captured from a fixed viewpoint under various illuminations. To this end we propose a deep learning approach to avoid heuristics and strong assumptions on the reflectance prior. We compare two network architectures: one classic 'U' shaped Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) composed of Convolutional Gated Recurrent Units (CGRU). We train our networks on a new dataset specifically designed for the task of intrinsic decomposition from sequences. We test our networks on MIT and BigTime datasets and outperform state-of-the-art algorithms both qualitatively and quantitatively.
