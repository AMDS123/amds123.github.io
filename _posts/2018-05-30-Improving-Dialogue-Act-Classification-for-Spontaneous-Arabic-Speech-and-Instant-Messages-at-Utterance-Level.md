##### Abstract
The ability to model and automatically detect dialogue act is an important step toward understanding spontaneous speech and Instant Messages. However, it has been difficult to infer a dialogue act from a surface utterance because it highly depends on the context of the utterance and speaker linguistic knowledge; especially in Arabic dialects. This paper proposes a statistical dialogue analysis model to recognize utterance's dialogue acts using a multi-classes hierarchical structure. The model can automatically acquire probabilistic discourse knowledge from a dialogue corpus were collected and annotated manually from multi-genre Egyptian call-centers. Extensive experiments were conducted using Support Vector Machines classifier to evaluate the system performance. The results attained in the term of average F-measure scores of 0.912; showed that the proposed approach has moderately improved F-measure by approximately 20%.

模拟和自动检测对话行为的能力是理解自发言语和即时消息的重要一步。然而，很难从表面话语中推断对话行为，因为它高度依赖于话语和说话者语言知识的背景;特别是在阿拉伯语方言中。本文提出了一个统计对话分析模型来识别使用多类分层结构的话语对话行为。该模型可以从对话语料库中自动获取概率性话语知识，这些知识是从多种类型的埃及呼叫中心手动收集和注释的。使用支持向量机分类器进行了大量实验来评估系统性能。在平均F-measure分数为0.912的条件下获得的结果;表明所提出的方法已经适度地提高了F-measure约20％。
