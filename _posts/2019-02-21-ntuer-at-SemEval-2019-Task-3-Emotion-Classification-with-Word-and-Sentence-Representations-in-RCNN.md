##### Abstract
In this paper we present our model on the task of emotion detection in textual conversations in SemEval-2019. Our model extends the Recurrent Convolutional Neural Network (RCNN) by using external fined-tuned word representations and DeepMoji sentence representations. We also explored several other competitive pre-trained word and sentence representations including ELMo, BERT and InferSent but found inferior performances. In addition, we conducted extensive sensitivity analysis, which empirically shows that our model is relatively robust to hyper-parameters. Our model requires no handcrafted features or emotion lexicons but achieved good performance with a test micro-F1 of 0.7463.
