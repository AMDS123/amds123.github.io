##### Abstract
As smartphone rooted distractions become commonplace, the lack of compelling safety measures has led to a rise in the number of injuries to distracted walkers. Various solutions address this problem by sensing a pedestrian's walking environment. Existing camera-based approaches have been largely limited to obstacle detection and other forms of object detection. Instead, we present TerraFirma, an approach that performs material recognition on the pedestrian's walking surface. We explore, first, how well commercial off-the-shelf smartphone cameras can learn texture to distinguish among paving materials in uncontrolled outdoor urban settings. Second, we aim at identifying when a distracted user is about to enter the street, which can be used to support safety functions such as warning the user to be cautious. To this end, we gather a unique dataset of street/sidewalk imagery from a pedestrian's perspective, that spans major cities like New York, Paris, and London. We demonstrate that modern phone cameras can be enabled to distinguish materials of walking surfaces in urban areas with more than 90% accuracy, and accurately identify when pedestrians transition from sidewalk to street.

随着智能手机根深蒂固的分心变得司空见惯，缺乏令人信服的安全措施导致分散步行者受伤的人数增加。各种解决方案通过感测行人的行走环境来解决这个问题。现有的基于摄像机的方法主要限于障碍物检测和其他形式的物体检测。相反，我们介绍TerraFirma，这是一种对行人的行走表面进行材料识别的方法。我们首先研究一下商业现成的智能手机摄像机如何学习纹理以区分不受控制的室外城市环境中的铺路材料。其次，我们的目标是确定一个分心的用户什么时候要进入街道，这可以用来支持安全功能，如警告用户要谨慎。为此，我们从行人的角度收集了一个独特的街道/人行道影像数据集，这些数据集涵盖了纽约，巴黎和伦敦等主要城市。我们证明，现代手机摄像头能够以90％以上的准确度区分城市中行走路面的材料，并准确识别行人从人行道到街道的过渡时间。
