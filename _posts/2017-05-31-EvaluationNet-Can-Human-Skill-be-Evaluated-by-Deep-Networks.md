##### Abstract
With the recent substantial growth of media such as YouTube, a considerable number of instructional videos covering a wide variety of tasks are available online. Therefore, online instructional videos have become a rich resource for humans to learn everyday skills. In order to improve the effectiveness of the learning with instructional video, observation and evaluation of the activity are required. However, it is difficult to observe and evaluate every activity steps by expert. In this study, a novel deep learning framework which targets human activity evaluation for learning from instructional video has been proposed. In order to deal with the inherent variability of activities, we propose to model activity as a structured process. First, action units are encoded from dense trajectories with LSTM network. The variable-length action unit features are then evaluated by a Siamese LSTM network. By the comparative experiments on public dataset, the effectiveness of the proposed method has been demonstrated.

随着近期YouTube等媒体的大幅增长，相当数量的教学视频覆盖了各种各样的任务。因此，在线教学视频已成为人类学习日常技能的丰富资源。为了提高教学视频学习的有效性，需要对活动进行观察和评估。然而，专家们很难观察和评估每一个活动的步骤。在这项研究中，提出了一个新的深度学习框架，其目标是从教学视频学习人类活动评估。为了处理活动的固有变异性，我们建议将活动建模为一个结构化的过程。首先，动作单元采用LSTM网络从密集轨迹进行编码。然后通过连体LSTM网络对变长动作单元特征进行评估。通过公共数据集的对比实验，证明了该方法的有效性。
