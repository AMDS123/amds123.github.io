##### Abstract
Computer vision based methods have been explored in the past for detection of railway track defects, but full automation has always been a challenge because both traditional image processing methods and deep learning classifiers trained from scratch fail to generalize that well to infinite novel scenarios seen in the real world, given limited amount of labeled data. Advancements have been made recently to make machine learning models utilize knowledge from a different but related domain. In this paper, we show that even though similar domain data is not available, transfer learning provides the model understanding of other real world objects and enables training production scale deep learning classifiers for uncontrolled real world data. Our models efficiently detect both track defects like sunkinks, loose ballast and railway assets like switches and signals. Models were validated with hours of track videos recorded in different continents resulting in different weather conditions, different ambience and surroundings. A track health index concept has also been proposed to monitor complete rail network.

基于计算机视觉的方法在过去已经被用于检测铁路轨道缺陷，但是全自动化一直是一个挑战，因为传统的图像处理方法和从头开始训练的深度学习分类器都不能很好地将其推广到无限的新颖场景真实世界，给定数量有限的标记数据。最近取得了进步，使机器学习模型利用来自不同但相关领域的知识。在本文中，我们表明即使相似的领域数据不可用，转让学习提供了对其他现实世界对象的模型理解，并且使得对不受控制的现实世界数据的训练生产规模深度学习分类器成为可能。我们的模型能够有效地检测出轨道缺陷，例如sunkinks，松散的压载和铁路资产，如开关和信号。使用不同大陆记录的小时轨道视频验证了模型，导致不同的天气条件，不同的环境和环境。轨道健康指数概念也被提出来监测整个铁路网络。
