##### Abstract
By representing a text by a set of words and their co-occurrences, one obtains a word-adjacency network - a network being in a way a reduced representation of the given language sample. In this paper, the possibility of using network representation in order to extract information about individual language styles of literary texts is studied. By determining selected quantitative characteristics of the networks and applying machine learning algorithms, it is made possible to distinguish between texts of different authors. It turns out that within the studied set of texts in English and Polish, the properly rescaled weighted clustering coefficients and weighted degrees of only a few nodes in the word-adjacency networks are sufficient to obtain the accuracy of authorship attribution over 90\%. A correspondence between the authorship of texts and the structure of word-adjacency networks can therefore clearly be found; it may be stated that the network representation allows to distinguish individual language styles by comparing the way the authors use particular words and punctuation marks. The presented approach can be viewed as a generalization of the authorship attribution methods based on simplest lexical features. 
 Apart from the characteristics given above, other network parameters are studied, both local and global ones, for both the unweighted and weighted networks. Their potential to capture the diversity of writing styles is discussed; some differences between languages are also observed.

##### Abstract (translated by Google)
通过用一组单词及其共现来表示文本，可以获得一个单词邻接网络 - 一种网络，其方式是给定语言样本的简化表示。在本文中，研究了使用网络表示来提取有关文学文本的个别语言风格的信息的可能性。通过确定网络的选定定量特征并应用机器学习算法，可以区分不同作者的文本。事实证明，在所研究的英语和波兰语文本集中，正确重新调整的加权聚类系数和单词邻接网络中仅少数节点的加权度足以获得作者身份归因的准确度超过90％。因此，可以清楚地找到文本的作者和文字邻接网络的结构之间的对应关系;可以说，网络表示允许通过比较作者使用特定单词和标点符号的方式来区分各个语言风格。所提出的方法可以被视为基于最简单的词汇特征的作者归属方法的概括。
 除了上面给出的特征之外，对于未加权和加权网络，研究了本地和全局的其他网络参数。讨论了他们捕捉写作风格多样性的潜力;还观察到语言之间的一些差异。
