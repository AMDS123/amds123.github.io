##### Abstract
This paper shows how Graph Neural Networks can be used for learning distributed coordination mechanisms in connected teams of robots. We capture the relational aspect of robot coordination by modeling the robot team as a graph, where each robot is a node, and edges represent communication links. During training, robots learn how to pass messages and update internal states, so that a target behavior is reached. As a proxy for more complex problems, this short paper considers the problem where each robot must locally estimate the algebraic connectivity of the team's network topology.
