##### Abstract
Exposure to intense illumination light is an unavoidable consequence of fluorescence microscopy, and poses a risk to the health of the sample in every live-cell fluorescence microscopy experiment. Furthermore, the possible side-effects of phototoxicity on the scientific conclusions that are drawn from an imaging experiment are often unaccounted for. Previously, controlling for phototoxicity in imaging experiments required additional labels and experiments, limiting its widespread application. Here we provide a proof-of-principle demonstration that the phototoxic effects of an imaging experiment can be identified directly from a single phase-contrast image using deep convolutional neural networks (ConvNets). This lays the groundwork for an automated tool for assessing cell health in a wide range of imaging experiments. Interpretability of such a method is crucial for its adoption. We take steps towards interpreting the classification mechanism of the trained ConvNet by visualizing salient features of images that contribute to accurate classification.

暴露于强烈的照明光下是荧光显微镜的不可避免的后果，并且在每个活细胞荧光显微镜实验中对样品的健康构成风险。此外，从成像实验得出的科学结论的光毒性的可能的副作用通常是不清楚的。以前，在成像实验中控制光毒性需要额外的标记和实验，限制了其广泛的应用。在这里，我们提供了一个证明原理的证明，成像实验的光毒性效应可以直接从一个单一的相位差图像使用深度卷积神经网络（ConvNets）来识别。这为在广泛的成像实验中评估细胞健康的自动化工具奠定了基础。这种方法的可解释性对其采用至关重要。我们采取步骤来解释训练的ConvNet的分类机制，通过可视化图像的显着特征，有助于准确分类。
