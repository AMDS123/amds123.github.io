##### Abstract
Considering the problem of color distortion caused by the defogging algorithm based on dark channel prior, an improved algorithm was proposed to calculate the transmittance of all channels respectively. First, incident light frequency's effect on the transmittance of various color channels was analyzed according to the Beer-Lambert's Law, from which a proportion among various channel transmittances was derived; afterwards, images were preprocessed by down-sampling to refine transmittance, and then the original size was restored to enhance the operational efficiency of the algorithm; finally, the transmittance of all color channels was acquired in accordance with the proportion, and then the corresponding transmittance was used for image restoration in each channel. The experimental results show that compared with the existing algorithm, this improved image defogging algorithm could make image colors more natural, solve the problem of slightly higher color saturation caused by the existing algorithm, and shorten the operation time by four to nine times.

针对基于暗通道先验的去雾算法所引起的色彩失真问题，提出了一种改进算法，分别计算各通道的透过率。首先，根据比尔 - 朗伯定律分析入射光频率对各种颜色通道透过率的影响，从中推导出各通道透过率之间的比例;然后对图像进行下采样预处理以提高透过率，然后恢复原始大小以提高算法的运行效率;最后，按照比例获取所有彩色通道的透过率，然后将相应的透过率用于各通道的图像恢复。实验结果表明，与现有算法相比，这种改进的图像去雾算法可以使图像颜色更加自然，解决了现有算法造成的色彩饱和度稍高的问题，缩短了四到九倍的操作时间。
