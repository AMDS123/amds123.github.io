##### Abstract
Accurate measurement of blast-induced rock fragmentation is of great importance for many mining operations. The post-blast rock size distribution can significantly influence the efficiency of all the downstream mining and comminution processes. Image analysis methods are one of the most common methods used to measure rock fragment size distribution in mines regardless of criticism for lack of accuracy to measure fine particles and other perceived deficiencies. The current practice of collecting rock fragmentation data for image analysis is highly manual and provides data with low temporal and spatial resolution. Using UAVs for collecting images of rock fragments can not only improve the quality of the image data but also automate the data collection process. Ultimately, real-time acquisition of high temporal- and spatial-resolution data based on UAV technology will provide a broad range of opportunities for both improving blast design without interrupting the production process and reducing the cost of the human operator. This paper presents the results of a series of laboratory-scale rock fragment measurements using a quadrotor UAV equipped with a camera. The goal of this work is to highlight the benefits of aerial fragmentation analysis in terms of both prediction accuracy and time effort. A pile of rock fragments with different fragment sizes was placed in a lab that is equipped with a motion capture camera system for precise UAV localization and control. Such an environment presents optimal conditions for UAV flight and thus, is well-suited for conducting proof-of-concept experiments before testing them in large-scale field experiments. The pile was photographed by a camera attached to the UAV, and the particle size distribution curves were generated in almost real-time. The pile was also manually photographed and the results of the manual method were compared to the UAV method.

准确测量爆炸引起的岩石碎裂对于许多采矿作业来说非常重要。爆炸后的岩石粒度分布可以显着影响所有下游采矿和粉碎过程的效率。图像分析方法是用于测量矿山中岩石碎片大小分布的最常用方法之一，不管批评是否缺乏精确度以测量细颗粒和其他感知缺陷。目前收集岩石碎片数据用于图像分析的做法是高度手动的，并且提供具有低时间和空间分辨率的数据。使用无人机收集岩石碎片图像，不仅可以提高图像数据的质量，而且可以自动完成数据采集过程。最终，基于无人机技术的高时空分辨率数据的实时采集将为在不中断生产过程的情况下改进爆破设计以及降低操作人员的成本提供广泛的机会。本文介绍了一系列实验室规模的岩石碎片测量的结果，使用装有相机的四旋翼无人机。这项工作的目标是突出空中碎片分析在预测精度和时间上的优势。一堆不同碎片大小的岩石碎片被放置在配备有运动捕捉摄像系统的实验室中，用于精确的无人机定位和控制。这样的环境为无人机飞行提供了最佳的条件，因此非常适合在大规模现场试验中进行试验前进行概念验证试验。用安装在无人飞行器上的照相机对桩进行拍摄，几乎实时地生成粒度分布曲线。还手动拍摄桩，并将手动方法的结果与无人机方法进行比较。
