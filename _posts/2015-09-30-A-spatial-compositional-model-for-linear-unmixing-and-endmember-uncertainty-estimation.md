##### Abstract
The normal compositional model (NCM) has been extensively used in hyperspectral unmixing. However, most of the previous research has focused on estimation of endmembers and/or their variability. Also, little work has employed spatial information in NCM. In this paper, we show that NCM can be used for calculating the uncertainty of the estimated endmembers with spatial priors incorporated for better unmixing. This results in a spatial compositional model (SCM) which features (i) spatial priors that force neighboring abundances to be similar based on their pixel similarity and (ii) a posterior that is obtained from a likelihood model which does not assume pixel independence. The resulting algorithm turns out to be easy to implement and efficient to run. We compared SCM with current state-of-the-art algorithms on synthetic and real images. The results show that SCM can in the main provide more accurate endmembers and abundances. Moreover, the estimated uncertainty can serve as a prediction of endmember error under certain conditions.

正常成分模型（NCM）已被广泛用于高光谱分解。然而，大多数以前的研究集中在对成员和/或其变异性的估计上。另外，很少有工作在NCM中使用空间信息。在本文中，我们表明，NCM可以用来计算不确定性的估计端元与空间先验纳入更好地unmixing。这导致了一个空间组成模型（SCM），其特征在于：（i）迫使相邻丰度基于其像素相似度相似的空间先验;以及（ii）从不假定像素独立性的似然模型获得的后验。由此产生的算法变得易于实现并且高效地运行。我们将SCM与目前在合成和真实图像上的最新算法进行了比较。结果显示SCM可以提供更准确的成分和丰度。此外，估计的不确定性可以作为在特定条件下端元误差的预测。
