##### Abstract
Sampling based planners have been successful in robot motion planning, with many degrees of freedom, but still remain ineffective in the presence of narrow passages within the configuration space. There exist several heuristics, which generate samples in the critical regions and improve the efficiency of probabilistic roadmap planners. In this paper, we present an evaluation of success probability of one such heuristic method, called obstacle based probabilistic roadmap planners or OBPRM, using geometric probability theory. The result indicates that the probability of success of generating free sample points around the surface of the $n$ dimensional configuration space obstacle is directly proportional to the surface area of the obstacles.
