##### Abstract
While microscopic analysis of histopathological slides is generally considered as the gold standard method for performing cancer diagnosis and grading, the current method for analysis is extremely time consuming and labour intensive as it requires pathologists to visually inspect tissue samples in a detailed fashion for the presence of cancer. As such, there has been significant recent interest in computer aided diagnosis systems for analysing histopathological slides for cancer grading to aid pathologists to perform cancer diagnosis and grading in a more efficient, accurate, and consistent manner. In this work, we investigate and explore a deep triple-stream residual network (TriResNet) architecture for the purpose of tile-level histopathology grading, which is the critical first step to computer-aided whole-slide histopathology grading. In particular, the design mentality behind the proposed TriResNet network architecture is to facilitate for the learning of a more diverse set of quantitative features to better characterize the complex tissue characteristics found in histopathology samples. Experimental results on two widely-used computer-aided histopathology benchmark datasets (CAMELYON16 dataset and Invasive Ductal Carcinoma (IDC) dataset) demonstrated that the proposed TriResNet network architecture was able to achieve noticeably improved accuracies when compared with two other state-of-the-art deep convolutional neural network architectures. Based on these promising results, the hope is that the proposed TriResNet network architecture could become a useful tool to aiding pathologists increase the consistency, speed, and accuracy of the histopathology grading process.

尽管组织病理学切片的显微分析通常被认为是进行癌症诊断和分级的金标准方法，但是目前的分析方法是非常耗时且耗费劳力的，因为它需要病理学家以详细方式目视检查组织样品，癌症。因此，近来对于计算机辅助诊断系统的重要意义在于分析用于癌症分级的组织病理学切片，以帮助病理学家以更有效，准确和一致的方式进行癌症诊断和分级。在这项工作中，我们调查和探索了一个深度三流残留网络（TriResNet）架构，以进行瓷砖级组织病理学分级，这是计算机辅助全片组织病理学分级的关键第一步。特别是，TriResNet网络体系结构背后的设计思路是为了学习更多不同的定量特征，以更好地表征组织病理学样本中发现的复杂组织特征。两个广泛使用的计算机辅助组织病理学基准数据集（CAMELYON16数据集和侵入性导管癌（IDC）数据集）的实验结果表明，与其他两个最先进的TriResNet网络架构相比，所提出的TriResNet网络架构能够显着提高精确度，艺术深度卷积神经网络架构。基于这些有希望的结果，希望提出的TriResNet网络架构可以成为帮助病理学家提高组织病理学分级过程的一致性，速度和准确性的有用工具。
