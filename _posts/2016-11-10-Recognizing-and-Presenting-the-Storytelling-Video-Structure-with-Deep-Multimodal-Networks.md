##### Abstract
This paper presents a novel approach for temporal and semantic segmentation of edited videos into meaningful segments, from the point of view of the storytelling structure. The objective is to decompose a long video into more manageable sequences, which can in turn be used to retrieve the most significant parts of it given a textual query and to provide an effective summarization. Previous video decomposition methods mainly employed perceptual cues, tackling the problem either as a story change detection, or as a similarity grouping task, and the lack of semantics limited their ability to identify story boundaries. Our proposal connects together perceptual, audio and semantic cues in a specialized deep network architecture designed with a combination of CNNs which generate an appropriate embedding, and clusters shots into connected sequences of semantic scenes, i.e. stories. A retrieval presentation strategy is also proposed, by selecting the semantically and aesthetically "most valuable" thumbnails to present, considering the query in order to improve the storytelling presentation. Finally, the subjective nature of the task is considered, by conducting experiments with different annotators and by proposing an algorithm to maximize the agreement between automatic results and human annotators.

##### Abstract (translated by Google)
从叙事结构的角度出发，本文提出了一种新颖的编辑视频时间和语义分割方法。其目的是将长视频分解成更易于管理的序列，这些序列反过来可以用来检索给出文本查询的最重要的部分，并提供有效的总结。以前的视频分解方法主要采用感性线索，把故事的变化检测作为一个相似性分组任务来解决，而缺乏语义学则限制了识别故事边界的能力。我们的建议将感知，音频和语义提示连接在一个专门的深层网络体系结构中，这个网络体系结构由CNN组合而成，这些CNN产生了适当的嵌入，并将镜头聚类到连接的语义场景序列中，即故事。还提出了一种检索呈现策略，通过选择语义上和美学上“最有价值”的缩略图来呈现，考虑到查询以改善叙事表现。最后，通过对不同的注释者进行实验，并提出一个最大化自动结果与人类注释者之间的一致性的算法，来考虑任务的主观性质。
