##### Abstract
Mapping is an essential task for mobile robots and topological representation often works as a basis for the various applications. In this paper, a novel framework that can build topological maps incrementally is proposed. The algorithm is based on distance map, and in our framework the topological map can grow as we append more sensor data into it. To demonstrate the result, we show the result of the distance map based method on several popular maps and run the incremental framework with the raw sensor data to have a growing topological map as robot explores the environment.
