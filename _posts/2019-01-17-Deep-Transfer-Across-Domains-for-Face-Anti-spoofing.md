##### Abstract
A practical face recognition system demands not only high recognition performance, but also the capability of detecting spoofing attacks. While emerging approaches of face anti-spoofing have been proposed in recent years, most of them do not generalize well to new database. The generalization ability of face anti-spoofing needs to be significantly improved before they can be adopted by practical application systems. The main reason for the poor generalization of current approaches is the variety of materials among the spoofing devices. As the attacks are produced by putting a spoofing display (e.t., paper, electronic screen, forged mask) in front of a camera, the variety of spoofing materials can make the spoofing attacks quite different. Furthermore, the background/lighting condition of a new environment can make both the real accesses and spoofing attacks different. Another reason for the poor generalization is that limited labeled data is available for training in face anti-spoofing. In this paper, we focus on improving the generalization ability across different kinds of datasets. We propose a CNN framework using sparsely labeled data from the target domain to learn features that are invariant across domains for face anti-spoofing. Experiments on public-domain face spoofing databases show that the proposed method significantly improve the cross-dataset testing performance only with a small number of labeled samples from the target domain.
