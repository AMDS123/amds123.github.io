##### Abstract
Constraint Programming (CP) is a powerful declarative programming paradigm combining inference and search in order to find solutions to various type of constraint systems. Dealing with highly disjunctive constraint systems is notoriously difficult in CP. Apart from trying to solve each disjunct independently from each other, there is little hope and effort to succeed in constructing intermediate results combining the knowledge originating from several disjuncts. In this paper, we propose If Then Else (ITE), a lightweight approach for implementing stratified constructive disjunction and negation on top of an existing CP solver, namely SICStus Prolog clp(FD). Although constructive disjunction is known for more than three decades, it does not have straightforward implementations in most CP solvers. ITE is a freely available library proposing stratified and constructive reasoning for various operators, including disjunction and negation, implication and conditional. Our preliminary experimental results show that ITE is competitive with existing approaches that handle disjunctive constraint systems.
