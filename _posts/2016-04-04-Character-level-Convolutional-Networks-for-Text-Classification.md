##### Abstract
This article offers an empirical exploration on the use of character-level convolutional networks (ConvNets) for text classification. We constructed several large-scale datasets to show that character-level convolutional networks could achieve state-of-the-art or competitive results. Comparisons are offered against traditional models such as bag of words, n-grams and their TFIDF variants, and deep learning models such as word-based ConvNets and recurrent neural networks.

本文为使用字符级卷积网络（ConvNets）进行文本分类提供了一个经验性的探索。我们构建了几个大规模的数据集，以表明字符级卷积网络可以达到最新的或竞争的结果。提供了比较传统的模型，如字袋，n-gram和TFIDF变体，以及深度学习模型，如基于字的ConvNets和递归神经网络。
