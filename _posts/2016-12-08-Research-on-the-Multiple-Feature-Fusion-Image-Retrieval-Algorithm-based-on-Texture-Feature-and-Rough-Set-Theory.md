##### Abstract
Recently, we have witnessed the explosive growth of images with complex information and content. In order to effectively and precisely retrieve desired images from a large-scale image database with low time-consuming, we propose the multiple feature fusion image retrieval algorithm based on the texture feature and rough set theory in this paper. In contrast to the conventional approaches that only use the single feature or standard, we fuse the different features with operation of normalization. The rough set theory will assist us to enhance the robustness of retrieval system when facing with incomplete data warehouse. To enhance the texture extraction paradigm, we use the wavelet Gabor function that holds better robustness. In addition, from the perspectives of the internal and external normalization, we re-organize extracted feature with the better combination. The numerical experiment has verified general feasibility of our methodology. We enhance the overall accuracy compared with the other state-of-the-art algorithms.

最近，我们看到了复杂的信息和内容的图像的爆炸性增长。为了从一个耗时较少的大规模图像数据库中有效精确地检索出所需图像，本文提出了基于纹理特征和粗糙集理论的多特征融合图像检索算法。与仅使用单个特征或标准的传统方法相比，我们将不同特征与规范化操作相融合。粗糙集理论将有助于提高面向不完全数据仓库时检索系统的鲁棒性。为了增强纹理提取范例，我们使用具有更好鲁棒性的小波Gabor函数。另外，从内外部规范化的角度出发，重新组织提取的特征。数值实验验证了我们方法的一般可行性。与其他最先进的算法相比，我们提高了整体的准确性。
