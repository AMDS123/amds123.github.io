##### Abstract
Traditional data quality control methods are based on users experience or previously established business rules, and this limits performance in addition to being a very time consuming process with lower than desirable accuracy. Utilizing deep learning, we can leverage computing resources and advanced techniques to overcome these challenges and provide greater value to users. In this paper, we, the authors, first review relevant works and discuss machine learning techniques, tools, and statistical quality models. Second, we offer a creative data quality framework based on deep learning and statistical model algorithm for identifying data quality. Third, we use data involving salary levels from an open dataset published by the state of Arkansas to demonstrate how to identify outlier data and how to improve data quality via deep learning. Finally, we discuss future work.
