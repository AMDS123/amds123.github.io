##### Abstract
Remote sensing image retrieval(RSIR), which aims to efficiently retrieve data of interest from large collections of remote sensing data, is a fundamental task in remote sensing. Over the past several decades, there has been significant effort to extract powerful feature representations for this task since the retrieval performance depends on the representative strength of the features. Benchmark datasets are also critical for developing, evaluating, and comparing RSIR approaches. Current benchmark datasets are deficient in that 1) they were originally collected for land use/land cover classification and not image retrieval, 2) they are relatively small in terms of the number of classes as well the number of sample images per class, and 3) the retrieval performance has saturated. These limitations have severely restricted the development of novel feature representations for RSIR, particularly the recent deep-learning based features which require large amounts of training data. We therefore present in this paper, a new large-scale remote sensing dataset termed "PatternNet" that was collected specifically for RSIR. PatternNet was collected from high-resolution imagery and contains 38 classes with 800 images per class. We also provide a thorough review of RSIR approaches ranging from traditional handcrafted feature based methods to recent deep learning based ones. We evaluate over 35 methods to establish extensive baseline results for future RSIR research using the PatternNet benchmark.

##### Abstract (translated by Google)
遥感图像检索（RSIR）旨在从大量的遥感数据中高效地检索感兴趣的数据，是遥感的一项基本任务。在过去的几十年中，由于检索性能取决于特征的代表性强度，所以已经有很大的努力来为这个任务提取强大的特征表示。基准数据集对于开发，评估和比较RSIR方法也是至关重要的。目前的基准数据集存在的不足之处在于：（1）原来是土地利用/土地覆盖分类而不是图像检索;（2）类别数量相对较少，每类样本图像数量较少; ）检索性能已经饱和。这些局限性严重制约了RSIR新颖特征表示的发展，特别是最近需要大量训练数据的深度学习特征。因此，我们在本文中提出了一个专门为RSIR收集的名为“PatternNet”的新型大规模遥感数据集。 PatternNet是从高分辨率图像中收集的，包含38个班，每班800个图像。我们还提供了从传统手工特征方法到最近深度学习的RSIR方法的全面回顾。我们评估了超过35种方法，使用PatternNet基准为未来的RSIR研究建立了广泛的基线结果。
