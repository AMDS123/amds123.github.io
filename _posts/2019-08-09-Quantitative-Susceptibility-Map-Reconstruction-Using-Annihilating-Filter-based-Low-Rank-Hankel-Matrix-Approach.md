##### Abstract
Quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM) inevitably suffers from streaking artifacts caused by zeros on the conical surface of the dipole kernel in k-space. This work proposes a novel and accurate QSM reconstruction method based on a direct k-space interpolation approach, avoiding problems of over smoothing and streaking artifacts. Inspired by the recent theory of annihilating filter-based low-rank Hankel matrix approach (ALOHA), QSM reconstruction problem is formulated as deconvolution problem under low-rank Hankel matrix constraint in the k-space. To reduce the computational complexity and the memory requirement, the problem is formulated as successive reconstruction of 2-D planes along three independent axes of the 3-D phase image in Fourier domain. Extensive experiments were performed to verify and compare the proposed method with existing QSM reconstruction methods. The proposed ALOHA-QSM effectively reduced streaking artifacts and accurately estimated susceptibility values in deep gray matter structures, compared to the existing QSM methods. Our suggested ALOHA-QSM algorithm successfully solves the three-dimensional QSM dipole inversion problem without additional anatomical information or prior assumption and provides good image quality and quantitative accuracy.
