##### Abstract
Assessing the presence and abundance of birds is important for monitoring specific species as well as overall ecosystem health. Many birds are most readily detected by their sounds, and thus passive acoustic monitoring is highly appropriate. Yet acoustic monitoring is often held back by practical limitations such as the need for manual configuration, reliance on example sound libraries, low accuracy, low robustness, and limited ability to generalise to novel acoustic conditions. Here we report outcomes from a collaborative data challenge showing that with modern machine learning including deep learning, general-purpose acoustic bird detection can achieve very high retrieval rates in remote monitoring data --- with no manual recalibration, and no pre-training of the detector for the target species or the acoustic conditions in the target environment. Multiple methods were able to attain performance of around 88% AUC (area under the ROC curve), much higher performance than previous general-purpose methods. We present new acoustic monitoring datasets, summarise the machine learning techniques proposed by challenge teams, conduct detailed performance evaluation, and discuss how such approaches to detection can be integrated into remote monitoring projects.

##### Abstract (translated by Google)
评估鸟类的存在和丰度对于监测特定物种以及整体生态系统健康非常重要。许多鸟类最容易被它们的声音检测到，因此被动声学监测非常合适。然而，声学监测通常受到实际限制的阻碍，例如需要手动配置，依赖于示例声音库，低精度，低鲁棒性以及推广到新颖声学条件的能力有限。在这里，我们报告了协作数据挑战的结果，表明通过现代机器学习（包括深度学习），通用声学鸟类检测可以在远程监控数据中实现非常高的检索率 - 无需手动重新校准，也无需预先培训目标物种的探测器或目标环境中的声学条件。多种方法能够获得约88％AUC（ROC曲线下面积）的性能，比以前的通用方法具有更高的性能。我们提供新的声学监测数据集，总结挑战团队提出的机器学习技术，进行详细的性能评估，并讨论如何将这些检测方法集成到远程监控项目中。
