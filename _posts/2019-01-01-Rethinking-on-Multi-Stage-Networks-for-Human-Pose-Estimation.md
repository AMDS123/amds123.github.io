##### Abstract
Existing pose estimation approaches can be categorized into single-stage and multi-stage methods. While a multi-stage architecture is seemingly more suitable for the task, the performance of current multi-stage methods is not as competitive as single-stage ones. This work studies this issue. We argue that the current unsatisfactory performance comes from various insufficient design in current methods. We propose several improvements on the architecture design, feature flow, and loss function. The resulting multi-stage network outperforms all previous works and obtains the best performance on COCO keypoint challenge 2018. The source code will be released.
