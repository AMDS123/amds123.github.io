##### Abstract
The ability to modulate vocal sounds and generate speech is one of the features which set humans apart from other living beings. The human voice can be characterized by several attributes such as pitch, timbre, loudness, and vocal tone. It has often been observed that humans express their emotions by varying different vocal attributes during speech generation. Hence, deduction of human emotions through voice and speech analysis has a practical plausibility and could potentially be beneficial for improving human conversational and persuasion skills. This paper presents an algorithmic approach for detection and analysis of human emotions with the help of voice and speech processing. The proposed approach has been developed with the objective of incorporation with futuristic artificial intelligence systems for improving human-computer interactions.

##### Abstract (translated by Google)
调制声音并产生语音的能力是使人类与其他生物分开的特征之一。人声可以通过音调，音色，响度和声调等几个属性来表征。人们常常观察到，人类在言语产生过程中通过改变不同的声音属性来表达自己的情绪。因此，通过语音和语音分析来推断人的情绪具有实际的合理性，并且可能有利于提高人类的对话和说服能力。本文提出了一种用语音和语音处理的方法来检测和分析人类情绪的算法。所提出的方法是为了与未来的人工智能系统相结合而开发的，目的是改善人机交互。
