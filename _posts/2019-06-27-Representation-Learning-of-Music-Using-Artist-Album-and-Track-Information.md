##### Abstract
Supervised music representation learning has been performed mainly using semantic labels such as music genres. However, annotating music with semantic labels requires time and cost. In this work, we investigate the use of factual metadata such as artist, album, and track information, which are naturally annotated to songs, for supervised music representation learning. The results show that each of the metadata has individual concept characteristics, and using them jointly improves overall performance.
