##### Abstract
As an advanced research topic in forensics science, automatic shoe-print identification has been extensively studied in the last two decades, since shoe marks are the clues most frequently left in a crime scene. Hence, these impressions provide a pertinent evidence for the proper progress of investigations in order to identify the potential criminals. The main goal of this survey is to provide a cohesive overview of the research carried out in forensic shoe-print identification and its basic background. Apart defining the problem and describing the phases that typically compose the processing chain of shoe-print identification, we provide a summary/comparison of the state-of-the-art approaches, in order to guide the neophyte and help to advance the research topic. This is done through introducing simple and basic taxonomies as well as summaries of the state-of-the-art performance. Lastly, we discuss the current open problems and challenges in this research topic, point out for promising directions in this field.
