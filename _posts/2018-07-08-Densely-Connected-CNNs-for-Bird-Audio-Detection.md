##### Abstract
Detecting bird sounds in audio recordings automatically, if accurate enough, is expected to be of great help to the research community working in bio- and ecoacoustics, interested in monitoring biodiversity based on audio field recordings. To estimate how accurate the state-of-the-art machine learning approaches are, the Bird Audio Detection challenge involving large audio datasets was recently organized. In this paper, experiments using several types of convolutional neural networks (i.e. standard CNNs, residual nets and densely connected nets) are reported in the framework of this challenge. DenseNets were the preferred solution since they were the best performing and most compact models, leading to a 88.22% area under the receiver operator curve score on the test set of the challenge. Performance gains were obtained thank to data augmentation through time and frequency shifting, model parameter averaging during training and ensemble methods using the geometric mean. On the contrary, the attempts to enlarge the training dataset with samples of the test set with automatic predictions used as pseudo-groundtruth labels consistently degraded performance.

如果足够准确的话，自动检测录音中的鸟声对于生物和生态声学领域的研究界有很大的帮助，他们有兴趣根据音频录音监测生物多样性。为了估计最先进的机器学习方法的准确性，最近组织了涉及大型音频数据集的Bird Audio Detection挑战。在本文中，在该挑战的框架中报告了使用几种类型的卷积神经网络（即标准CNN，残余网和密集连接的网）的实验。 DenseNets是首选解决方案，因为它们是性能最佳且最紧凑的模型，在挑战测试集上的接收器操作员曲线得分下面积达到88.22％。由于通过时间和频率变换的数据增加，训练期间的模型参数平均以及使用几何平均的集合方法，获得了性能增益。相反，使用具有用作伪地面标签的自动预测的测试集的样本来扩大训练数据集的尝试一致地降低了性能。
