##### Abstract
Treating children with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) with behavioral interventions, such as Pivotal Response Treatment (PRT), has shown promise in recent studies. However, deciding which therapy is best for a given patient is largely by trial and error, and choosing an ineffective intervention results in loss of valuable treatment time. We propose predicting patient response to PRT from baseline task-based fMRI by the novel application of a random forest and tree bagging strategy. Our proposed learning pipeline uses random forest regression to determine candidate brain voxels that may be informative in predicting treatment response. The candidate voxels are then tested stepwise for inclusion in a bagged tree ensemble. After the predictive model is constructed, bias correction is performed to further increase prediction accuracy. Using data from 19 ASD children who underwent a 16 week trial of PRT and a leave-one-out cross-validation framework, the presented learning pipeline was tested against several standard methods and variations of the pipeline and resulted in the highest prediction accuracy.

用行为干预治疗自闭症谱系障碍（ASD）儿童，如关键反应治疗（PRT），在最近的研究中显示了前景。然而，决定哪一种治疗最适合给定的患者主要是通过试验和错误，选择无效的干预会导致宝贵的治疗时间的损失。我们建议通过随机森林和树袋装策略的新颖应用，从基线任务功能磁共振成像预测患者对PRT的反应。我们提出的学习流程使用随机森林回归来确定可能在预测治疗反应时提供信息的候选脑体素。候选体素然后逐步测试以包含在袋装树合奏中。在构建预测模型之后，执行偏差校正以进一步提高预测精度。使用来自经历了16周PRT试验和留一法交叉验证框架的19名ASD儿童的数据，所提供的学习管道针对多种标准方法和管道变化进行测试，并且导致最高的预测准确度。
