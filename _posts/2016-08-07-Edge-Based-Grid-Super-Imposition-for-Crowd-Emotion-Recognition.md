##### Abstract
Numerous automatic continuous emotion detection system studies have examined mostly use of videos and images containing individual person expressing emotions. This study examines the detection of spontaneous emotions in a group and crowd settings. Edge detection was used with a grid of lines superimposition to extract the features. The feature movement in terms of movement from the reference point was used to track across sequences of images from the color channel. Additionally the video data capturing was done on spontaneous emotions invoked by watching sports events from group of participants. The method was view and occlusion independent and the results were not affected by presence of multiple people chaotically expressing various emotions. The edge thresholds of 0.2 and grid thresholds of 20 showed the best accuracy results. The overall accuracy of the group emotion classifier was 70.9%.

许多自动连续情绪检测系统研究已经检查了大部分使用包含表达情绪的个人的视频和图像。这项研究检查在一个群体和人群设置自发情绪的检测。边缘检测与叠加的网格线一起使用以提取特征。使用从参考点移动的特征移动来跟踪来自颜色通道的图像序列。此外，视频数据采集是通过观看来自参与者群体的体育赛事引发的自发情绪进行的。该方法是观看和封闭独立的，结果不受混杂表示各种情绪的多个人的存在的影响。 0.2的边缘阈值和20的栅格阈值表现出最好的准确性结果。群体情感分类的总体准确率为70.9％。
