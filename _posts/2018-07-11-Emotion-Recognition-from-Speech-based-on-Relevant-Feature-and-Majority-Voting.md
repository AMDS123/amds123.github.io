##### Abstract
This paper proposes an approach to detect emotion from human speech employing majority voting technique over several machine learning techniques. The contribution of this work is in two folds: firstly it selects those features of speech which is most promising for classification and secondly it uses the majority voting technique that selects the exact class of emotion. Here, majority voting technique has been applied over Neural Network (NN), Decision Tree (DT), Support Vector Machine (SVM) and K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN). Input vector of NN, DT, SVM and KNN consists of various acoustic and prosodic features like Pitch, Mel-Frequency Cepstral coefficients etc. From speech signal many feature have been extracted and only promising features have been selected. To consider a feature as promising, Fast Correlation based feature selection (FCBF) and Fisher score algorithms have been used and only those features are selected which are highly ranked by both of them. The proposed approach has been tested on Berlin dataset of emotional speech [3] and Electromagnetic Articulography (EMA) dataset [4]. The experimental result shows that majority voting technique attains better accuracy over individual machine learning techniques. The employment of the proposed approach can effectively recognize the emotion of human beings in case of social robot, intelligent chat client, call-center of a company etc.

##### Abstract (translated by Google)
本文提出了一种利用多数投票技术通过多种机器学习技术来检测人类语音情感的方法。这项工作的贡献有两个方面：首先，它选择最有希望进行分类的语音特征;其次，它使用选择精确类别情感的多数投票技术。这里，多数表决技术已应用于神经网络（NN），决策树（DT），支持向量机（SVM）和K-最近邻（KNN）。 NN，DT，SVM和KNN的输入向量由各种声学和韵律特征组成，如音高，Mel频率倒谱系数等。从语音信号中提取了许多特征，并且只选择了有希望的特征。为了将特征视为有希望的，已经使用了基于快速相关的特征选择（FCBF）和Fisher得分算法，并且仅选择了由它们两者高度排名的那些特征。所提出的方法已经在柏林情绪语音数据集[3]和电磁脑电图（EMA）数据集[4]上进行了测试。实验结果表明，多数投票技术比单个机器学习技术具有更好的准确性。在社交机器人，智能聊天客户端，公司呼叫中心等情况下，所采用的方法可以有效地识别人类的情绪。
