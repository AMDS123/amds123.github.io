##### Abstract
Recommendation systems have an important place to help online users in the internet society. Recommendation Systems in computer science are of very practical use these days in various aspects of the Internet portals, such as social networks, and library websites. There are several approaches to implement recommendation systems, Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) is one the popular techniques in Topic Modeling. Recently, researchers have proposed many approaches based on Recommendation Systems and LDA. According to importance of the subject, in this paper we discover the trends of the topics and find relationship between LDA topics and Scholar-Context-documents. In fact, We apply probabilistic topic modeling based on Gibbs sampling algorithms for a semantic mining from six conference publications in computer science from DBLP dataset. According to our experimental results, our semantic framework can be effective to help organizations to better organize these conferences and cover future research topics.
