##### Abstract
Binary Hashing is widely used for effective approximate nearest neighbors search. Even though various binary hashing methods have been proposed, very few methods are feasible for extremely high-dimensional features often used in visual tasks today. We propose a novel highly sparse linear hashing method based on pairwise rotations. The encoding cost of the proposed algorithm is $\mathrm{O}(n \log n)$ for n-dimensional features, whereas that of the existing state-of-the-art method is typically $\mathrm{O}(n^2)$. The proposed method is also remarkably faster in the learning phase. Along with the efficiency, the retrieval accuracy is comparable to or slightly outperforming the state-of-the-art. Pairwise rotations used in our method are formulated from an analytical study of the trade-off relationship between quantization error and entropy of binary codes. Although these hashing criteria are widely used in previous researches, its analytical behavior is rarely studied. All building blocks of our algorithm are based on the analytical solution, and it thus provides a fairly simple and efficient procedure.

二进制散列被广泛用于有效的近似最近邻搜索。尽管已经提出了各种二进制散列方法，但对于当今视觉任务中经常使用的极高维特征来说，很少有方法可行。我们提出了一种基于成对旋转的高度稀疏线性哈希方法。所提出的算法的编码成本为n维特征的$ \ mathrm {O}（n \ log n）$，而现有技术的方法的编码代价通常为$ \ mathrm {O}（n ^ 2）$。所提出的方法在学习阶段也显着更快。随着效率的提高，检索的准确性可以与现有技术相媲美，或略微超越现有技术水平。在我们的方法中使用的成对旋转是从对二进制码的量化误差和熵之间的权衡关系的分析研究中制定的。虽然这些哈希标准在以前的研究中被广泛使用，但其分析行为却很少被研究。我们算法的所有构建块都基于解析解决方案，因此提供了一个相当简单和高效的过程。
