##### Abstract
Quantum algorithms have the potential to be very powerful. However, to exploit quantum parallelism, some quantum algorithms require an embedding of large classical data into quantum states. This embedding can cost a lot of resources, for instance by implementing quantum random-access memory (QRAM). An important instance of this is in quantum-enhanced machine learning algorithms. We propose a new way of circumventing this requirement by using a classical-quantum hybrid architecture where the input data can remain classical, which differs from other hybrid models. We apply this to a fundamental computational problem called Boolean oracle identification, which offers a useful primitive for quantum machine learning algorithms. Its aim is to identify an unknown oracle amongst a list of candidates while minimising the number of queries to the oracle. In our scheme, we replace the classical oracle with our hybrid oracle. We demonstrate both theoretically and numerically that the success rates of the oracle query can be improved in the presence of noise and also enables us to explore a larger search space. This also makes the model suitable for realisation in the current era of noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices. Furthermore, we can show our scheme can lead to a reduction in the learning sample complexity. This means that for certain sizes of learning samples, our classical-quantum hybrid learner can complete the learning task faithfully whereas a classical learner cannot.
