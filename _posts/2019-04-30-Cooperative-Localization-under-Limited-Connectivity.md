##### Abstract
We report two novel decentralized multi-agent cooperative localization algorithms in which, to reduce the communication cost, inter-agent state estimate correlations are not maintained but accounted for implicitly. In our first algorithm, to guarantee filter consistency, we account for unknown inter-agent correlations via an upper bound on the joint covariance matrix of the agents. In the second method, we use an optimization framework to estimate the unknown inter-agent cross-covariance matrix. In our algorithms, each agent localizes itself in a global coordinate frame using a local filter driven by local dead reckoning and occasional absolute measurement updates and opportunistically corrects its pose estimate whenever a relative measurement takes place between this agent and another mobile agent. To process that relative measurement, only those two agents need to communicate with each other. Consequently, our algorithms are decentralized algorithms that do not impose restrictive network-wide connectivity condition. Moreover, we make no assumptions about the type of agents or relative measurements. We demonstrate our algorithms in simulation and a robotic experiment.
