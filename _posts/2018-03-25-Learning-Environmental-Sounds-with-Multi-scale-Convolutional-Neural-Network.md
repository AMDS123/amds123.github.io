##### Abstract
Deep learning has dramatically improved the performance of sounds recognition. However, learning acoustic models directly from the raw waveform is still challenging. Current waveform-based models generally use time-domain convolutional layers to extract features. The features extracted by single size filters are insufficient for building discriminative representation of audios. In this paper, we propose multi-scale convolution operation, which can get better audio representation by improving the frequency resolution and learning filters cross all frequency area. For leveraging the waveform-based features and spectrogram-based features in a single model, we introduce two-phase method to fuse the different features. Finally, we propose a novel end-to-end network called WaveMsNet based on the multi-scale convolution operation and two-phase method. On the environmental sounds classification datasets ESC-10 and ESC-50, the classification accuracies of our WaveMsNet achieve 93.75% and 79.10% respectively, which improve significantly from the previous methods.

深度学习显着提高了声音识别的性能。但是，直接从原始波形学习声学模型仍然具有挑战性。目前的基于波形的模型通常使用时域卷积层来提取特征。单尺寸滤波器提取的特征不足以构建音频的区分表示。在本文中，我们提出了多尺度卷积运算，它可以通过提高频率分辨率和跨所有频率区域学习滤波器来获得更好的音频表示。为了在单个模型中利用基于波形的特征和基于频谱图的特征，我们引入了两阶段方法来融合不同的特征。最后，我们提出了一种基于多尺度卷积运算和两阶段方法的新型端到端网络WaveMsNet。在环境声音分类数据集ESC-10和ESC-50上，我们WaveMsNet的分类精度分别达到93.75％和79.10％，与以前的方法相比，这些数据有了显着提高。
