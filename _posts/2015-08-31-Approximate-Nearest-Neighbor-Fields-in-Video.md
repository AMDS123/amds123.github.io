##### Abstract
We introduce RIANN (Ring Intersection Approximate Nearest Neighbor search), an algorithm for matching patches of a video to a set of reference patches in real-time. For each query, RIANN finds potential matches by intersecting rings around key points in appearance space. Its search complexity is reversely correlated to the amount of temporal change, making it a good fit for videos, where typically most patches change slowly with time. Experiments show that RIANN is up to two orders of magnitude faster than previous ANN methods, and is the only solution that operates in real-time. We further demonstrate how RIANN can be used for real-time video processing and provide examples for a range of real-time video applications, including colorization, denoising, and several artistic effects.

我们介绍RIANN（环相交近似最近邻居搜索），一种用于实时将视频的补丁匹配到一组参考补丁的算法。对于每个查询，RIANN通过在外观空间中的关键点周围相交的环找到可能的匹配。它的搜索复杂度与时间变化的量是反向相关的，使得它非常适合视频，通常大多数补丁会随着时间慢慢变化。实验表明，RIANN比以前的ANN方法快两个数量级，是唯一实时运行的解决方案。我们进一步演示RIANN如何用于实时视频处理，并提供一系列实时视频应用的实例，包括彩色化，去噪和几种艺术效果。
