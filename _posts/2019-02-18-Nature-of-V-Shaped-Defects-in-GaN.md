##### Abstract
GaN films with thicknesses up to 3 mm were grown in two custom-made halide vapor phase epitaxy (HVPE) reactors. V-shaped defects (pits) with densities from 1 cm$^{-2}$ to 100 cm$^{-2}$ were found on the surfaces of the films. Origins of pit formation and the process of pit overgrowth were studied by analyzing the kinematics of pit evolution. Two mechanisms of pit overgrowth were observed. Pits can be overgrown intentionally by varying growth parameters to increase the growth rate of pit facets. Pits can overgrow spontaneously if a fast-growing facet nucleates at their bottom under constant growth conditions.
