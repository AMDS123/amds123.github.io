##### Abstract
There is a widely held belief in the digital image and video processing community, which is as follows: the Human Visual System (HVS) is more sensitive to luminance (often confused with brightness) than photon energies (often confused with chromaticity and chrominance). Passages similar to the following occur with high frequency in the peer reviewed literature and academic text books: "the HVS is much more sensitive to brightness than colour" or "the HVS is much more sensitive to luma than chroma". In this discussion paper, a Visible Light-Based Human Visual System (VL-HVS) conceptual model is discussed. The objectives of VL-HVS are as follows: 1. To facilitate a deeper theoretical reflection of the fundamental relationship between visible light, the manifestation of colour perception derived from visible light and the physiology of the perception of colour. That is, in terms of the physics of visible light, photobiology and the human subjective interpretation of visible light, it is appropriate to provide comprehensive background information in relation to the natural interactions between visible light, the retinal photoreceptors and the subsequent cortical processing of such. 2. To provide a more wholesome account with respect to colour information in digital image and video processing applications. 3. To recontextualise colour data in the RGB and YCbCr colour spaces, such that novel techniques in digital image and video processing, including quantisation and artifact reduction techniques, may be developed based on both luma and chroma information (not luma data only).

人们对数字图像和视频处理社区有着广泛的信念，即人类视觉系统（HVS）比光子能量（经常与色度和色度混淆）对亮度更敏感（经常与亮度混淆）。在同行评审的文献和学术教科书中，高频率出现类似于以下的通道：“HVS比亮度对亮度敏感得多”或“HVS比亮度对亮度敏感得多”。在这篇讨论文章中，讨论了基于可见光的人类视觉系统（VL-HVS）概念模型。 VL-HVS的目标如下：1.促进对可见光之间的基本关系，可见光导致的颜色感知的表现以及对颜色感知的生理学的更深入的理论反映。也就是说，在可见光，光生物学和可见光的人的主观解释的物理方面，它是适当的相对于可见光，视网膜光感受器和这种随后的皮质处理之间的自然交互提供全面的背景资料。 2.为数字图像和视频处理应用中的颜色信息提供更健康的帐户。 3. recontextualise在RGB和YCbCr色彩空间的彩色数据，使得在数字图像和视频处理，包括量化和伪像减少技术的新颖的技术，可以基于亮度和色度信息（仅未亮度数据）来开发。
