##### Abstract
Distributed surveillance systems have become popular in recent years due to security concerns. However, transmitting high dimensional data in bandwidth-limited distributed systems becomes a major challenge. In this paper, we address this issue by proposing a novel probabilistic algorithm based on the divergence between the probability distributions of the visual features in order to reduce their dimensionality and thus save the network bandwidth in distributed wireless smart camera networks. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach through extensive experiments on two surveillance recognition tasks.

分布式监控系统由于安全问题近年来变得流行起来。然而，在带宽有限的分布式系统中传输高维数据成为一个主要挑战。本文针对这一问题，提出了一种基于视觉特征概率分布差异的新型概率算法，以降低其维数，从而节省分布式无线智能相机网络的网络带宽。我们通过对两个监视识别任务进行广泛的实验来证明所提出的方法的有效性。
