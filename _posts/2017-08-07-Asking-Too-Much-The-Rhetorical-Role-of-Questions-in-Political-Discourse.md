##### Abstract
Questions play a prominent role in social interactions, performing rhetorical functions that go beyond that of simple informational exchange. The surface form of a question can signal the intention and background of the person asking it, as well as the nature of their relation with the interlocutor. While the informational nature of questions has been extensively examined in the context of question-answering applications, their rhetorical aspects have been largely understudied. In this work we introduce an unsupervised methodology for extracting surface motifs that recur in questions, and for grouping them according to their latent rhetorical role. By applying this framework to the setting of question sessions in the UK parliament, we show that the resulting typology encodes key aspects of the political discourse---such as the bifurcation in questioning behavior between government and opposition parties---and reveals new insights into the effects of a legislator's tenure and political career ambitions.

问题在社会交往中扮演着重要角色，表现出超越简单信息交流的修辞功能。问题的表面形式可以表明询问者的意图和背景，以及他们与对话者的关系的性质。虽然问题的信息性已经在提问应用的情况下进行了广泛的研究，但是他们的修辞方面却在很大程度上被忽略了。在这项工作中，我们介绍一种无监督的方法来提取在问题中重现的表面图案，并根据其潜在的修辞作用对它们进行分组。通过将这一框架应用于英国议会的问题会议，我们发现，由此产生的类型学是对政治话语的关键方面进行编码的，例如政府和反对党之间的分歧问题，揭示了新的见解纳入立法者任期和政治职业抱负的影响。
