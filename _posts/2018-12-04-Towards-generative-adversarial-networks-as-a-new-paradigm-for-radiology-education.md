##### Abstract
Medical students and radiology trainees typically view thousands of images in order to "train their eye" to detect the subtle visual patterns necessary for diagnosis. Nevertheless, infrastructural and legal constraints often make it difficult to access and quickly query an abundance of images with a user-specified feature set. In this paper, we use a conditional generative adversarial network (GAN) to synthesize $1024\times1024$ pixel pelvic radiographs that can be queried with conditioning on fracture status. We demonstrate that the conditional GAN learns features that distinguish fractures from non-fractures by training a convolutional neural network exclusively on images sampled from the GAN and achieving an AUC of $&gt;0.95$ on a held-out set of real images. We conduct additional analysis of the images sampled from the GAN and describe ongoing work to validate educational efficacy.
