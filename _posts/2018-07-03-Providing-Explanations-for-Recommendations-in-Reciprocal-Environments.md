##### Abstract
Automated platforms which support users in finding a mutually beneficial match, such as online dating and job recruitment sites, are becoming increasingly popular. These platforms often include recommender systems that assist users in finding a suitable match. While recommender systems which provide explanations for their recommendations have shown many benefits, explanation methods have yet to be adapted and tested in recommending suitable matches. In this paper, we introduce and extensively evaluate the use of "reciprocal explanations" -- explanations which provide reasoning as to why both parties are expected to benefit from the match. Through an extensive empirical evaluation, in both simulated and real-world dating platforms with 287 human participants, we find that when the acceptance of a recommendation involves a significant cost (e.g., monetary or emotional), reciprocal explanations outperform standard explanation methods which consider the recommendation receiver alone. However, contrary to what one may expect, when the cost of accepting a recommendation is negligible, reciprocal explanations are shown to be less effective than the traditional explanation methods.

支持用户寻找互惠匹配的自动化平台，例如在线约会和招聘网站，正变得越来越流行。这些平台通常包括帮助用户找到合适匹配的推荐系统。虽然为其建议提供解释的推荐系统已经显示出许多益处，但是在推荐合适的匹配时尚未调整和测试解释方法。在本文中，我们介绍并广泛评估“互惠解释”的使用 - 这些解释提供了为什么双方都希望从比赛中受益的推理。通过广泛的实证评估，在有287名人类参与者的模拟和现实约会平台中，我们发现当接受推荐涉及显着成本（例如，货币或情感）时，相互解释优于标准解释方法，这些方法考虑到单独推荐接收器。然而，与人们所期望的相反，当接受推荐的成本可以忽略不计时，相互解释被证明不如传统的解释方法有效。
