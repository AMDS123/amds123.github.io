##### Abstract
While some remarkable progress has been made in neural machine translation (NMT) research, there have not been many reports on its development and evaluation in practice. This paper tries to fill this gap by presenting some of our findings from building an in-house travel domain NMT system in a large scale E-commerce setting. The three major topics that we cover are optimization and training (including different optimization strategies and corpus sizes), handling real-world content and evaluating results.

虽然神经机器翻译（NMT）研究取得了一些显着进展，但在实际应用中的发展和评价报道却不多。本文试图通过介绍我们在大规模电子商务环境中构建内部旅游域NMT系统的一些发现来填补这一空白。我们涵盖的三大主题是优化和培训（包括不同的优化策略和语料库大小），处理实际内容和评估结果。
