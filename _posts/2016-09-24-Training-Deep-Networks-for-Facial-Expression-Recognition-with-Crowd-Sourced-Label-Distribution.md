##### Abstract
Crowd sourcing has become a widely adopted scheme to collect ground truth labels. However, it is a well-known problem that these labels can be very noisy. In this paper, we demonstrate how to learn a deep convolutional neural network (DCNN) from noisy labels, using facial expression recognition as an example. More specifically, we have 10 taggers to label each input image, and compare four different approaches to utilizing the multiple labels: majority voting, multi-label learning, probabilistic label drawing, and cross-entropy loss. We show that the traditional majority voting scheme does not perform as well as the last two approaches that fully leverage the label distribution. An enhanced FER+ data set with multiple labels for each face image will also be shared with the research community.

人群采购已成为广泛采用的收集地面真相标签的方案。然而，这些标签可能非常嘈杂是一个众所周知的问题。在本文中，我们将演示如何使用面部表情识别来学习来自噪声标签的深度卷积神经网络（DCNN）。更具体地说，我们有10个标记器来标记每个输入图像，并比较四种不同的方法来利用多个标签：多数投票，多标签学习，概率标签绘制和交叉熵损失。我们表明，传统的多数投票方案表现不如最后两种充分利用标签分布的方法。一个增强的FER +数据集，每个脸部图像有多个标签，也将与研究界共享。
