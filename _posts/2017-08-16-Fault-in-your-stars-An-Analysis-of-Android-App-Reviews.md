##### Abstract
Mobile app distribution platforms such as Google Play Store allow users to share their feedback about downloaded apps in the form of a review comment and a corresponding star rating. Typically, the star rating ranges from one to five stars, with one star denoting a high sense of dissatisfaction with the app and five stars denoting a high sense of satisfaction. Unfortunately, due to a variety of reasons, often the star rating provided by a user is inconsistent with the opinion expressed in the review. For example, consider the following review for the Facebook App on Android; "Awesome App". One would reasonably expect the rating for this review to be five stars, but the actual rating is one star! Such inconsistent ratings can lead to a deflated (or inflated) overall average rating of an app which can affect user downloads, as typically users look at the average star ratings while making a decision on downloading an app. Also, the app developers receive a biased feedback about the application that does not represent ground reality. This is especially significant for small apps with a few thousand downloads as even a small number of mismatched reviews can bring down the average rating drastically. In this paper, we conducted a study on this review-rating mismatch problem. We manually examined 8600 reviews from 10 popular Android apps and found that 20% of the ratings in our dataset were inconsistent with the review. Further, we developed three systems; two of which were based on traditional machine learning and one on deep learning to automatically identify reviews whose rating did not match with the opinion expressed in the review. Our deep learning system performed the best and had an accuracy of 92% in identifying the correct star rating to be associated with a given review.

移动应用分发平台（例如Google Play商店）允许用户以评论评论和相应的星级评分的形式分享他们对下载应用的反馈。通常情况下，星级评分从一星到五星不等，一颗星表示对应用程序的高度不满，五星表示高满意度。不幸的是，由于各种原因，用户提供的星级评分通常与评论中表达的观点不一致。例如，请考虑Android上的Facebook应用的以下评论; “真棒应用程序”。人们可以合理地预期这次审查的评级是五星，但实际评级是一颗星！这种不一致的评级可能会导致应用程序的整体平均收视率下降（或膨胀），这会影响用户的下载量，因为通常用户会在下载应用程序的同时查看平均星级。此外，应用程序开发人员收到有关应用程序的偏见反馈，不代表地面现实。对于有几千个下载量的小应用来说，这一点尤其重要，因为即使是少量不匹配的评论也会大幅降低平均评分。在这篇论文中，我们对这个评论不匹配问题进行了研究。我们手动检查了10个流行Android应用的8600条评论，发现我们数据集中20％的评分与评论不一致。此外，我们开发了三个系统;其中两个是基于传统的机器学习，一个是深度学习，自动识别评级与评论中表达的意见不符的评论。我们的深度学习系统表现最好，准确度达到92％，可以确定与给定评论相关的正确星级。
