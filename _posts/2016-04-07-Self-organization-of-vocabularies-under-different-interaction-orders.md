##### Abstract
Traditionally, the formation of vocabularies has been studied by agent-based models (specially, the Naming Game) in which random pairs of agents negotiate word-meaning associations at each discrete time step. This paper proposes a first approximation to a novel question: To what extent the negotiation of word-meaning associations is influenced by the order in which the individuals interact? Automata Networks provide the adequate mathematical framework to explore this question. Computer simulations suggest that on two-dimensional lattices the typical features of the formation of word-meaning associations are recovered under random schemes that update small fractions of the population at the same time.

传统上，词汇的形成已经由基于代理的模型（特别是命名游戏）进行研究，其中随机的代理对在每个离散时间步骤处协商词义关联。本文提出了一个新的问题的第一个近似：在什么程度上谈判的词义协会是受个人相互作用的顺序影响？自动机网络提供了足够的数学框架来探索这个问题。计算机模拟表明，在二维格子上，形成词义关联的典型特征在随机方案中得到恢复，这些随机方案同时更新小部分人口。
