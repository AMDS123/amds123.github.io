##### Abstract
A lot of approaches, each following a different strategy, have been proposed in the literature to provide AdaBoost with cost-sensitive properties. In the first part of this series of two papers, we have presented these algorithms in a homogeneous notational framework, proposed a clustering scheme for them and performed a thorough theoretical analysis of those approaches with a fully theoretical foundation. The present paper, in order to complete our analysis, is focused on the empirical study of all the algorithms previously presented over a wide range of heterogeneous classification problems. The results of our experiments, confirming the theoretical conclusions, seem to reveal that the simplest approach, just based on cost-sensitive weight initialization, is the one showing the best and soundest results, despite having been recurrently overlooked in the literature.

在文献中已经提出了许多方法，每个方法都遵循不同的策略，以向AdaBoost提供成本敏感的属性。在这两篇论文的前半部分，我们将这些算法提出了一个均匀的符号框架，为他们提出了一个聚类方案，并在充分的理论基础上对这些方法进行了深入的理论分析。为了完成我们的分析，本文重点研究了以前在广泛的异构分类问题上提出的所有算法的实证研究。我们的实验结果证实了理论结论，似乎表明，尽管在文献中被忽略，最简单的方法，即基于成本敏感的权重初始化，是最好的和最有希望的结果。
