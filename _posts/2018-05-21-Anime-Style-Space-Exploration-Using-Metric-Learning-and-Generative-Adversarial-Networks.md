##### Abstract
Deep learning-based style transfer between images has recently become a popular area of research. A common way of encoding "style" is through a feature representation based on the Gram matrix of features extracted by some pre-trained neural network or some other form of feature statistics. Such a definition is based on an arbitrary human decision and may not best capture what a style really is. In trying to gain a better understanding of "style", we propose a metric learning-based method to explicitly encode the style of an artwork. In particular, our definition of style captures the differences between artists, as shown by classification performances, and such that the style representation can be interpreted, manipulated and visualized through style-conditioned image generation through a Generative Adversarial Network. We employ this method to explore the style space of anime portrait illustrations.

图像之间基于深度学习的风格转移最近已成为一个热门的研究领域。编码“风格”的常见方式是通过基于由某种预先训练的神经网络或某种其他形式的特征统计提取的特征的格拉姆矩阵的特征表示。这样的定义是基于任意的人的决定，并不能最好地捕捉真正的风格。为了更好地理解“风格”，我们提出了一种基于度量学习的方法来明确地对艺术作品的风格进行编码。特别是，我们对风格的定义捕捉了艺术家之间的差异，如分类表现所示，并且风格表示可以通过生成敌对网络通过风格条件图像生成来解释，操纵和可视化。我们采用这种方法来探索动漫人像插图的风格空间。
