##### Abstract
The framework of the seventeen sustainable development goals is a challenge for developers and researchers applying artificial intelligence (AI). AI and earth observations (EO) can provide reliable and disaggregated data for better monitoring of the sustainable development goals (SDGs). In this paper, we present an overview of SDG targets, which can be effectively measured with AI tools. We identify indicators with the most significant contribution from the AI and EO and describe an application of state-of-the-art machine learning models to one of the indicators. We describe an application of U-net with SE blocks for efficient segmentation of satellite imagery for crop detection. Finally, we demonstrate how AI can be more effectively applied in solutions directly contributing towards specific SDGs and propose further research on an AI-based evaluative infrastructure for SDGs.
