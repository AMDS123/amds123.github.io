##### Abstract
As computing systems become increasingly advanced and as users increasingly engage themselves in technology, security has never been a greater concern. In malware detection, static analysis has been the prominent approach. This approach, however, quickly falls short as malicious programs become more advanced and adopt the capabilities of obfuscating its binaries to execute the same malicious functions, making static analysis virtually inapplicable to newer variants. The approach assessed in this paper uses dynamic analysis of malware which may generalize better than static analysis to variants. Widely used document classification techniques were assessed in detecting malware by doing such analysis on system call traces, a form of dynamic analysis. Features considered are extracted from system call traces of benign and malicious programs, and the task to classify these traces is treated as a binary document classification task using sparse features. The system call traces were processed to remove the parameters to only leave the system call function names. The features were grouped into various n-grams and weighted with Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency. Support Vector Machines were used and optimized using a Stochastic Gradient Descent algorithm that implemented L1, L2, and Elastic-Net regularization terms, the best of which achieved a highest of 98% accuracy with 98% recall score. Additional contributions include the identification of significant system call sequences that could be avenues for further research.

随着计算系统越来越先进，用户越来越多地参与技术，安全问题从未受到更多关注。在恶意软件检测中，静态分析一直是突出的方法。但是，随着恶意程序变得更加先进，并且采用混淆二进制文件执行相同恶意功能的功能，这种方法很快就会失效，从而使静态分析几乎不适用于较新的变体。本文中评估的方法使用恶意软件的动态分析，这可能比静态分析更好地推广到变体。广泛使用的文件分类技术通过对系统调用轨迹（一种动态分析的形式）进行分析来检测恶意软件。考虑的特征从良性和恶意程序的系统调用痕迹中提取，并且将这些痕迹分类的任务被视为使用稀疏特征的二进制文档分类任务。处理系统调用跟踪以删除参数以仅留下系统调用函数名称。这些特征被分成不同的n元组，​​并用Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency进行加权。支持向量机被使用并且使用实现L1，L2和弹性网正则化术语的随机梯度下降算法进行了优化，其中最好的98％的回忆分数达到98％的最高准确度。其他贡献包括确定可能成为进一步研究途径的重要系统调用序列。
