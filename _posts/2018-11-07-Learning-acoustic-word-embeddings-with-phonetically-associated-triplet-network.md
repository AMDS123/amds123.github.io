##### Abstract
Previous researches on acoustic word embeddings used in query-by-example spoken term detection have shown remarkable performance improvements when using a triplet network. However, the triplet network is trained using only a limited information about acoustic similarity between words. In this paper, we propose a novel architecture, \textit{phonetically associated triplet network} (PATN), which aims at increasing discriminative power of acoustic word embeddings by utilizing phonetic information as well as word identity. The proposed model is learned to minimize a combined loss function that was made by introducing a cross entropy loss to the lower layer of LSTM-based triplet network. We observed that the proposed method performs significantly better than the baseline triplet network on a word discrimination task with the WSJ dataset resulting in over $40\%$ relative improvement in recall rate at $1.0$ false alarm per hour. Finally, we examined the generalization ability by conducting the out-of-domain test on the RM dataset.
