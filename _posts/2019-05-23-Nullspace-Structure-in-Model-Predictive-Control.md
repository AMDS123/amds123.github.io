##### Abstract
Robotic tasks can be accomplished by exploiting different forms of redundancies. This work focuses on planning redundancy within Model Predictive Control (MPC) in which several paths can be considered within the MPC time horizon. We present the nullspace structure in MPC with a quadratic approximation of the cost and a linearization of the dynamics. We exploit the low rank structure of the precision matrices used in MPC (encapsulating spatiotemporal information) to perform hierarchical task planning, and show how nullspace computation can be treated as a fusion problem (computed with a product of Gaussian experts). We illustrate the approach using proof-of-concept examples with point mass objects and simulated robotics applications.
