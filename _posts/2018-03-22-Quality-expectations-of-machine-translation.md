##### Abstract
Machine Translation (MT) is being deployed for a range of use-cases by millions of people on a daily basis. There should, therefore, be no doubt as to the utility of MT. However, not everyone is convinced that MT can be useful, especially as a productivity enhancer for human translators. In this chapter, I address this issue, describing how MT is currently deployed, how its output is evaluated and how this could be enhanced, especially as MT quality itself improves. Central to these issues is the acceptance that there is no longer a single 'gold standard' measure of quality, such that the situation in which MT is deployed needs to be borne in mind, especially with respect to the expected 'shelf-life' of the translation itself.

##### Abstract (translated by Google)
机器翻译（MT）正在为数百万人日常使用的一系列用例进行部署。因此，MT应该是毫无疑问的。然而，并不是每个人都相信MT可以发挥作用，特别是作为人力资源翻译者的生产力提升者。在本章中，我将讨论这个问题，描述当前如何部署MT，如何评估MT的输出以及如何加强MT，特别是MT质量本身提高时。这些问题的核心是接受：现在不再有一种单一的“黄金标准”质量衡量标准，因此需要牢记部署MT的情况，特别是关于预期的“货架期”翻译本身。
