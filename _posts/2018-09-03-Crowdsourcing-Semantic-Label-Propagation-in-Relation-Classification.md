##### Abstract
Distant supervision is a popular method for performing relation extraction from text that is known to produce noisy labels. Most progress in relation extraction and classification has been made with crowdsourced corrections to distant-supervised labels, and there is evidence that indicates still more would be better. In this paper, we explore the problem of propagating human annotation signals gathered for open-domain relation classification through the CrowdTruth methodology for crowdsourcing, that captures ambiguity in annotations by measuring inter-annotator disagreement. Our approach propagates annotations to sentences that are similar in a low dimensional embedding space, expanding the number of labels by two orders of magnitude. Our experiments show significant improvement in a sentence-level multi-class relation classifier.

远程监督是用于从已知产生噪声标签的文本执行关系提取的流行方法。关系提取和分类的大部分进展都是通过对远程监督标签进行众包校正来进行的，并且有证据表明更多会更好。在本文中，我们通过用于众包的CrowdTruth方法探索了为开放域关系分类收集的人类注释信号的传播问题，通过测量注释器间的不一致来捕捉注释中的模糊性。我们的方法将注释传播到低维嵌入空间中相似的句子，将标签数量扩展两个数量级。我们的实验表明句子级多类关系分类器有显着改进。
