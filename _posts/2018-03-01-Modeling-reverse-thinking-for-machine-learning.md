##### Abstract
Human inertial thinking schemes can be formed through learning, which are then applied to quickly solve similar problems later. However, when problems are significantly different, inertial thinking generally presents the solutions that are definitely imperfect. In such cases, people will apply creative thinking, such as reverse thinking, to solve problems. Similarly, machine learning methods also form inertial thinking schemes through learning the knowledge from a large amount of data. However, when the testing data are vastly difference, the formed inertial thinking schemes will inevitably generate errors. This kind of inertial thinking is called illusion inertial thinking. Because all machine learning methods do not consider illusion inertial thinking, in this paper we propose a new method that uses reverse thinking to correct illusion inertial thinking, which increases the generalization ability of machine learning methods. Experimental results on benchmark datasets are used to validate the proposed method.

##### Abstract (translated by Google)
人类惯性思维方案可以通过学习形成，然后应用于以后快速解决类似的问题。然而，当问题显着不同时，惯性思维通常会提出绝对不完美的解决方案。在这种情况下，人们会运用逆向思维等创造性思维来解决问题。同样，机器学习方法也通过从大量数据中学习知识形成惯性思维方案。然而，当测试数据差异很大时，形成的惯性思维方案将不可避免地产生错误。这种惯性思维被称为幻觉惯性思维。由于所有的机器学习方法都没有考虑惯性思维，所以本文提出了一种利用反向思维纠正幻觉惯性思维的新方法，增加了机器学习方法的泛化能力。基准数据集上的实验结果用于验证所提出的方法。
