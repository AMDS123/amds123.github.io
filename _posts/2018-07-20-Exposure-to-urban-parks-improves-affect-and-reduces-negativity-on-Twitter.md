##### Abstract
Urbanization and the decline of access to nature have coincided with a rise of mental health problems. A growing body of research has demonstrated an association between nature contact and improved mental affect (i.e., mood). However, previous approaches have been unable to quantify the benefits of urban greenspace exposure and compare how different types of outdoor public spaces impact mood. Here, we use Twitter to investigate how mental affect varies before, during, and after visits to a large urban park system. We analyze the sentiment of tweets to estimate the magnitude and duration of the affect benefit of visiting parks. We find that affect is substantially higher during park visits and remains elevated for several hours following the visit. Visits to Regional Parks, which are greener and have greater vegetative cover, result in a greater increase in affect compared to Civic Plazas and Squares. Finally, we analyze the words in tweets around park visits to explore several theorized mechanisms linking nature exposure with mental and cognitive benefits. Negation words such as "no", "not", and "don't" decrease in frequency during visits to urban parks. These results point to the most beneficial types of nature contact for mental health benefits and can be used by urban planners and public health officials to improve the well-being of growing urban populations.

##### Abstract (translated by Google)
城市化和自然获取的减少恰逢精神健康问题的出现。越来越多的研究表明，自然接触与改善的心理影响（即情绪）之间存在关联。然而，以前的方法无法量化城市绿地暴露的好处，并比较不同类型的户外公共空间如何影响情绪。在这里，我们使用Twitter来调查在访问大型城市公园系统之前，期间和之后心理影响的变化。我们分析推文的情绪，以估计访问公园的影响效益的幅度和持续时间。我们发现在公园参观期间影响要大得多，并且在访问后几个小时内仍然会升高。与公民广场和广场相比，参观更环保且植被覆盖更广的区域公园，影响力更大。最后，我们分析围绕公园参观的推文中的单词，探索将自然暴露与心理和认知利益联系起来的几种理论机制。在访问城市公园期间，诸如“不”，“不”和“不”等否定词的频率会降低。这些结果指出了最有益的自然接触类型的心理健康益处，城市规划者和公共卫生官员可以使用这些接触来改善城市人口增长的福祉。
