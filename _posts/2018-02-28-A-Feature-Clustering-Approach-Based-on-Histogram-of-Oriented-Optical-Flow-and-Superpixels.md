##### Abstract
Visual feature clustering is one of the cost-effective approaches to segment objects in videos. However, the assumptions made for developing the existing algorithms prevent them from being used in situations like segmenting an unknown number of static and moving objects under heavy camera movements. This paper addresses the problem by introducing a clustering approach based on superpixels and short-term Histogram of Oriented Optical Flow (HOOF). Salient Dither Pattern Feature (SDPF) is used as the visual feature to track the flow and Simple Linear Iterative Clustering (SLIC) is used for obtaining the superpixels. This new clustering approach is based on merging superpixels by comparing short term local HOOF and a color cue to form high-level semantic segments. The new approach was compared with one of the latest feature clustering approaches based on K-Means in eight-dimensional space and the results revealed that the new approach is better by means of consistency, completeness, and spatial accuracy. Further, the new approach completely solved the problem of not knowing the number of objects in a scene.

视觉特征聚类是划分视频中对象的经济有效方法之一。然而，为开发现有算法所做的假设阻止它们用于在摄像机移动较重的情况下分割未知数量的静态和移动物体的情况。本文通过引入基于超像素和面向光流的短期直方图（HOOF）的聚类方法来解决该问题。突出的抖动模式特征（SDPF）用作跟踪流动的视觉特征，简单线性迭代聚类（SLIC）用于获取超像素。这种新的聚类方法基于通过比较短期局部HOOF和颜色提示来合并超级像素以形成高级语义片段。该新方法与基于八维空间中K-Means的最新特征聚类方法进行了比较，结果表明新方法通过一致性，完整性和空间精度更好。此外，新方法完全解决了不知道场景中物体数量的问题。
