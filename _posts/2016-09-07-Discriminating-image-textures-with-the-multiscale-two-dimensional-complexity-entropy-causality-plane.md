##### Abstract
The aim of this paper is to further explore the usefulness of the two-dimensional complexity-entropy causality plane as a texture image descriptor. A multiscale generalization is introduced in order to distinguish between different roughness features of images at small and large spatial scales. Numerically generated two-dimensional structures are initially considered for illustrating basic concepts in a controlled framework. Then, more realistic situations are studied. Obtained results allow us to confirm that intrinsic spatial correlations of images are successfully unveiled by implementing this multiscale symbolic information-theory approach. Consequently, we conclude that the proposed representation space is a versatile and practical tool for identifying, characterizing and discriminating image textures.

本文的目的是进一步探讨二维复杂熵因果平面作为纹理图像描述符的有用性。引入了多尺度泛化，以便在小尺度和大尺度空间尺度上区分图像的不同粗糙度特征。数值生成的二维结构最初被认为是用来说明受控框架中的基本概念。然后，研究更现实的情况。获得的结果使我们能够确认图像的内在空间相关性通过实施这种多尺度符号信息论方法而成功揭示。因此，我们得出这样的结论：提出的表示空间是用于识别，表征和区分图像纹理的多用途和实用工具。
