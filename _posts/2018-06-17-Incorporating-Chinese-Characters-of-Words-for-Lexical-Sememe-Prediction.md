##### Abstract
Sememes are minimum semantic units of concepts in human languages, such that each word sense is composed of one or multiple sememes. Words are usually manually annotated with their sememes by linguists, and form linguistic common-sense knowledge bases widely used in various NLP tasks. Recently, the lexical sememe prediction task has been introduced. It consists of automatically recommending sememes for words, which is expected to improve annotation efficiency and consistency. However, existing methods of lexical sememe prediction typically rely on the external context of words to represent the meaning, which usually fails to deal with low-frequency and out-of-vocabulary words. To address this issue for Chinese, we propose a novel framework to take advantage of both internal character information and external context information of words. We experiment on HowNet, a Chinese sememe knowledge base, and demonstrate that our framework outperforms state-of-the-art baselines by a large margin, and maintains a robust performance even for low-frequency words.

##### Abstract (translated by Google)
Sememes是人类语言中概念的最小语义单位，因此每个单词的意义由一个或多个义务组成。词语通常由语言学家用他们的谚语手动注释，并形成在各种NLP任务中广泛使用的语言常识知识库。最近，引入了词汇臆测预测任务。它包括自动推荐词义，这有望提高注释的效率和一致性。然而，现有的词汇义位预测方法通常依赖于词的外部环境来表示意义，而这通常不能处理低频和词外词。为了解决这个问题，我们提出了一个新颖的框架来利用内部字符信息和外部语境信息。我们在HowNet这个中国知识库基础上进行实验，并且证明我们的框架大大超过了最先进的基线，并且即使对于低频词也保持了强劲的表现。
