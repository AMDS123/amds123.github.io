##### Abstract
This work deviates from easy-to-define class boundaries for object interactions. For the task of object interaction recognition, often captured using an egocentric view, we show that semantic ambiguities in verbs and recognising sub-interactions along with concurrent interactions result in legitimate class overlaps (Figure 1). We thus aim to model the mapping between observations and interaction classes, as well as class overlaps, towards a probabilistic multi-label classifier that emulates human annotators. Given a video segment containing an object interaction, we model the probability for a verb, out of a list of possible verbs, to be used to annotate that interaction. The proba- bility is learnt from crowdsourced annotations, and is tested on two public datasets, comprising 1405 video sequences for which we provide annotations on 90 verbs. We outper- form conventional single-label classification by 11% and 6% on the two datasets respectively, and show that learning from annotation probabilities outperforms majority voting and enables discovery of co-occurring labels.

这项工作偏离了易于定义的对象交互的类边界。对于对象交互识别的任务，通常使用一个以自我为中心的视图捕获，我们表明，动词中的语义歧义和识别子交互以及并发交互导致合法类重叠（图1）。因此，我们的目标是模拟观察和相互作用类之间的映射以及类重叠，来模拟人类注释者的概率多标签分类器。给定包含对象交互的视频片段，我们将动词的概率模型化为可能动词列表，用于注释该交互。从众包注释中学习概率，并在两个公共数据集上进行测试，包括1405个视频序列，我们为其提供90个动词的注释。在两个数据集上，我们分别比传统的单标签分类高出11％和6％，表明从注释概率的学习优于大多数投票，并能够发现共现标签。
