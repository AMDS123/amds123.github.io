##### Abstract
We present the IMS-Speech, a web based tool for German and English speech transcription aiming to facilitate research in various disciplines which require accesses to lexical information in spoken language materials. This tool is based on modern open source software stack, advanced speech recognition methods and public data resources and is freely available for academic researchers. The utilized models are built to be generic in order to provide transcriptions of competitive accuracy on a diverse set of tasks and conditions.
