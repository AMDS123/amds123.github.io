##### Abstract
Opinion polls have been the bridge between public opinion and politicians in elections. However, developing surveys to disclose people's feedback with respect to economic issues is limited, expensive, and time-consuming. In recent years, social media such as Twitter has enabled people to share their opinions regarding elections. Social media has provided a platform for collecting a large amount of social media data. This paper proposes a computational public opinion mining approach to explore the discussion of economic issues in social media during an election. Current related studies use text mining methods independently for election analysis and election prediction; this research combines two text mining methods: sentiment analysis and topic modeling. The proposed approach has effectively been deployed on millions of tweets to analyze economic concerns of people during the 2012 US presidential election.

##### Abstract (translated by Google)
民意调查是选举中舆论和政治家之间的桥梁。但是，开展调查以披露人们对经济问题的反馈意见是有限的，昂贵的和耗时的。近年来，Twitter等社交媒体让人们分享他们对选举的看法。社交媒体为收集大量社交媒体数据提供了一个平台。本文提出了一种计算舆论挖掘方法来探讨选举期间社交媒体中的经济问题。目前相关研究独立使用文本挖掘方法进行选举分析和选举预测;本研究结合两种文本挖掘方法：情感分析和主题建模。该提议的方法已经有效地部署在数百万推特上，以分析2012年美国总统选举期间人们对经济的担忧。
