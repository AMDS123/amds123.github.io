##### Abstract
High-resolution satellite imagery have been increasingly used on remote sensing classification problems. One of the main factors is the availability of this kind of data. Even though, very little effort has been placed on the zebra crossing classification problem. In this letter, crowdsourcing systems are exploited in order to enable the automatic acquisition and annotation of a large-scale satellite imagery database for crosswalks related tasks. Then, this dataset is used to train deep-learning-based models in order to accurately classify satellite images that contains or not zebra crossings. A novel dataset with more than 240,000 images from 3 continents, 9 countries and more than 20 cities was used in the experiments. Experimental results showed that freely available crowdsourcing data can be used to accurately (97.11%) train robust models to perform crosswalk classification on a global scale.

高分辨率卫星图像越来越多地用于遥感分类问题。其中一个主要因素是这种数据的可用性。尽管对斑马线分类问题的研究很少。在这封信中，采用了众包系统，以实现大规模卫星图像数据库自动获取和注释人行横道相关的任务。然后，这个数据集被用来训练基于深度学习的模型，以便精确地分类包含斑马线或非斑马线的卫星图像。实验中使用了来自3大洲，9个国家和超过20个城市的超过240000个图像的新颖数据集。实验结果表明，免费提供的众包数据可以准确地（97.11％）训练鲁棒模型在全球范围内进行人行横道分类。
