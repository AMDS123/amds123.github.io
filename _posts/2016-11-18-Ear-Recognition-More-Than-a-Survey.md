##### Abstract
Automatic identity recognition from ear images represents an active field of research within the biometric community. The ability to capture ear images from a distance and in a covert manner makes the technology an appealing choice for surveillance and security applications as well as other application domains. Significant contributions have been made in the field over recent years, but open research problems still remain and hinder a wider (commercial) deployment of the technology. This paper presents an overview of the field of automatic ear recognition (from 2D images) and focuses specifically on the most recent, descriptor-based methods proposed in this area. Open challenges are discussed and potential research directions are outlined with the goal of providing the reader with a point of reference for issues worth examining in the future. In addition to a comprehensive review on ear recognition technology, the paper also introduces a new, fully unconstrained dataset of ear images gathered from the web and a toolbox implementing several state-of-the-art techniques for ear recognition. The dataset and toolbox are meant to address some of the open issues in the field and are made publicly available to the research community.

##### Abstract (translated by Google)
从耳朵图像自动识别身份代表了生物识别领域的一个活跃的研究领域。从远距离和隐蔽的方式捕捉耳朵图像的能力使得该技术成为监视和安全应用以及其他应用领域的有吸引力的选择。近年来在这个领域做出了重大贡献，但是公开的研究问题依然存在，阻碍了技术的广泛应用（商业化）。本文介绍了自动人耳识别（来自二维图像）的领域的概述，并且特别关注在该领域中提出的最新的基于描述符的方法。讨论开放性挑战，并概述潜在的研究方向，目的是为读者提供一个值得研究的问题的参考点。除了对耳朵识别技术进行全面的综述之外，本文还介绍了一个全新的，完全不受限制的从网络收集的耳朵图像的数据集，以及一个实现几种最先进的耳朵识别技术的工具箱。数据集和工具箱旨在解决该领域的一些公开问题，并向研究界公开。
