##### Abstract
The search for life via characterization of earth-like planets in the habitable zone is one of the key scientific objectives in Astronomy. We describe a new phase-occulting (PO) interferometric nulling coronagraphy (NC) approach. The PO-NC approach employs beamwalk and freeform optical surfaces internal to the interferometer cavity to introduce a radially dependent plate scale difference between each interferometer arm (optical path) that nulls the central star at high contrast while transmitting the off-axis field. The design is readily implemented on segmented-mirror telescope architectures, utilizing a single nulling interferometer to achieve high throughput, a small inner working angle (IWA), sixth-order or higher starlight suppression, and full off-axis discovery space, a combination of features that other coronagraph designs generally must trade. Unlike previous NC approaches, the PO-NC approach does not require pupil shearing; this increases throughput and renders it less sensitive to on-axis common-mode telescope errors, permitting relief of the observatory stability required to achieve contrast levels of $\leq10^{-10}$. Observatory operations are also simplified by removing the need for multiple telescope rolls and shears to construct a high contrast image. The design goals for a PO nuller are similar to other coronagraphs intended for direct detection of habitable zone (HZ) exoEarth signal: contrasts on the order of $10^{-10}$ at an IWA of $\leq3\lambda/D$ over $\geq10$% bandpass with a large ($>10$~m) segmented aperture space-telescope operating in visible and near infrared bands. This work presents an introduction to the PO nulling coronagraphy approach based on its Visible Nulling Coronagraph (VNC) heritage and relation to the radial shearing interferometer.
