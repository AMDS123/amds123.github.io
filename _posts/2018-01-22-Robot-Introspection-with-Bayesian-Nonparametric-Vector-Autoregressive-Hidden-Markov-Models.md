##### Abstract
Robot introspection, as opposed to anomaly detection typical in process monitoring, helps a robot understand what it is doing at all times. A robot should be able to identify its actions not only when failure or novelty occurs, but also as it executes any number of sub-tasks. As robots continue their quest of functioning in unstructured environments, it is imperative they understand what is it that they are actually doing to render them more robust. This work investigates the modeling ability of Bayesian nonparametric techniques on Markov Switching Process to learn complex dynamics typical in robot contact tasks. We study whether the Markov switching process, together with Bayesian priors can outperform the modeling ability of its counterparts: an HMM with Bayesian priors and without. The work was tested in a snap assembly task characterized by high elastic forces. The task consists of an insertion subtask with very complex dynamics. Our approach showed a stronger ability to generalize and was able to better model the subtask with complex dynamics in a computationally efficient way. The modeling technique is also used to learn a growing library of robot skills, one that when integrated with low-level control allows for robot online decision making.

与过程监测中典型的异常检测相反，机器人内省可以帮助机器人了解它在任何时候都在做什么。一个机器人应该能够识别自己的行为，不仅在发生故障或新奇时，而且在执行任何数量的子任务时。随着机器人继续在非结构化环境中寻求功能，他们必须了解他们实际上在做什么以使其更加健壮。本文研究了贝叶斯非参数技术在马尔可夫转换过程中的建模能力，以学习机器人接触任务中典型的复杂动力学过程。我们研究马尔可夫切换过程与贝叶斯先验是否可以胜过其对应的建模能力：一个具有贝叶斯先验和没有贝叶斯先验的HMM。这项工作是在一个以高弹力为特征的快速装配任务中进行测试的。该任务由一个动态非常复杂的插入子任务组成。我们的方法表现出更强的泛化能力，并且能够以计算有效的方式更好地用复杂动力学对子任务进行建模。建模技术也被用来学习一个越来越多的机器人技能库，一个与低级控制集成的机器人技能允许机器人在线决策。
