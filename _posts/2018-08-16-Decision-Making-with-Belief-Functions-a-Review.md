##### Abstract
Approaches to decision-making under uncertainty in the belief function framework are reviewed. Most methods are shown to blend criteria for decision under ignorance with the maximum expected utility principle of Bayesian decision theory. A distinction is made between methods that construct a complete preference relation among acts, and those that allow incomparability of some acts due to lack of information. Methods developed in the imprecise probability framework are applicable in the Dempster-Shafer context and are also reviewed. Shafer's constructive decision theory, which substitutes the notion of goal for that of utility, is described and contrasted with other approaches. The paper ends by pointing out the need to carry out deeper investigation of fundamental issues related to decision-making with belief functions and to assess the descriptive, normative and prescriptive values of the different approaches.

##### Abstract (translated by Google)
审查了信念职能框架中不确定性下的决策方法。大多数方法都表明将无知决策的标准与贝叶斯决策理论的最大期望效用原理相结合。在行为之间构建完整的偏好关系的方法与由于缺乏信息而允许某些行为无法比较的方法之间存在区别。在不精确概率框架中开发的方法适用于Dempster-Shafer上下文并且也被审查。 Shafer的建设性决策理论，用目标的概念代替效用的概念，被描述并与其他方法形成对比。本文最后指出有必要对与信仰功能决策相关的基本问题进行更深入的调查，并评估不同方法的描述性，规范性和规范性价值。
