##### Abstract
In this work the properties of multi choice minority games are studied by means of extensive computational simulations. We have considered several ways of rewarding the strategies of the players and compared the resulting behaviours of the ensemble. It is shown that introducing a reward for the second place can improve the overall performance significantly. Our new but still very simple architecture of stategies shows interesting properties. In the version of the multi choice minority game which also rewards second best choice the unordered phase is strongly suppressed and the global performance of the ensemble is significantly improved. The efficiency of this model can come close to the one of standard minority games that use adaptive genetic algorithms for searching good strategies.
