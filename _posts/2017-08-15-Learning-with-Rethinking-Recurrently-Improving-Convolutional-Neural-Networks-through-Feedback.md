##### Abstract
Recent years have witnessed the great success of convolutional neural network (CNN) based models in the field of computer vision. CNN is able to learn hierarchically abstracted features from images in an end-to-end training manner. However, most of the existing CNN models only learn features through a feedforward structure and no feedback information from top to bottom layers is exploited to enable the networks to refine themselves. In this paper, we propose a "Learning with Rethinking" algorithm. By adding a feedback layer and producing the emphasis vector, the model is able to recurrently boost the performance based on previous prediction. Particularly, it can be employed to boost any pre-trained models. This algorithm is tested on four object classification benchmark datasets: CIFAR-100, CIFAR-10, MNIST-background-image and ILSVRC-2012 dataset. These results have demonstrated the advantage of training CNN models with the proposed feedback mechanism.

近年来，基于卷积神经网络（CNN）的计算机视觉领域取得了巨大的成功。 CNN能够以端到端的训练方式从图像中分层抽取特征。然而，现有的CNN模型大都只是通过前馈结构学习特征，并没有利用上下层的反馈信息来使网络自我完善。在本文中，我们提出了一个“反思学习”算法。通过添加一个反馈层并产生重点向量，该模型能够基于之前的预测反复地提升性能。特别是，它可以用来提高任何预先训练的模型。该算法在四个对象分类基准数据集上测试：CIFAR-100，CIFAR-10，MNIST-background-image和ILSVRC-2012数据集。这些结果已经证明了利用所提出的反馈机制来训练CNN模型的优点。
