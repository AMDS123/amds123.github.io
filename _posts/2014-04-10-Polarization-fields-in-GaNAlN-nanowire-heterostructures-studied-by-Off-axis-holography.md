##### Abstract
In this work, we present an off-axis holography study of GaN/AlN heterostructured nanowires grown by plasma-assisted molecular-beam epitaxy. We discuss the sample preparation of nanowire samples for electron holography and combine potential profiles obtained using holography with theoretical calculations of the projected potential in order to gain understanding of the potential distribution in these nanostructures. The effects of surface states are discussed
