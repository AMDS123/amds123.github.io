##### Abstract
Object categorization is a hot issue of an image mining. Contextual information between objects is one of the important semantic knowledge of an image. However, the previous researches for an object categorization have not made full use of the contextual information, especially the spatial relations between objects. In addition, the object categorization methods, which generally use the probabilistic graphical models to implement the incorporation of contextual information with appearance of objects, are almost inevitable to evaluate the intractable partition function for normalization. In this work, we introduced fully-connected fuzzy spatial relations including directional, distance and topological relations between object regions, so the spatial relational information could be fully utilized. Then, the spatial relations were considered as well as co-occurrence and appearance of objects by using energy-based model, where the energy function was defined as the region-object association potential and the configuration potential of objects. Minimizing the energy function of whole image arrangement, we obtained the optimal label set about the image regions and addressed the evaluation of intractable partition function in conditional random fields. Experimental results show the validity and reliability of this proposed method.

对象分类是图像挖掘的热点问题。对象之间的上下文信息是图像的重要语义知识之一。然而，以前的对象分类研究还没有充分利用上下文信息，特别是对象间的空间关系。另外，通常使用概率图模型来实现上下文信息与对象外观的结合的对象分类方法几乎不可避免地要评估用于规范化的难处理分区函数。在这项工作中，我们引入了完全连接的模糊空间关系，包括对象区域之间的方向性，距离性和拓扑性的关系，从而充分利用空间关系信息。然后，利用基于能量的模型考虑空间关系以及物体的共现和外观，其中能量函数被定义为区域 - 对象关联势和物体的配置潜力。最小化整个图像排列的能量函数，得到了图像区域的最优标注集，解决了条件随机场中难分割分割函数的评价问题。实验结果表明了该方法的有效性和可靠性。
