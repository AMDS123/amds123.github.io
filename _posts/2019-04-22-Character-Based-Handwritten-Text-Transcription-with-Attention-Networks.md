##### Abstract
The paper approaches the task of handwritten text transcription with attentional encoder-decoder networks that are trained on sequences of characters. We experiment on lines of text from a popular handwriting database and compare different attention mechanisms for the decoder. The model trained with softmax attention achieves the lowest test error, outperforming several other RNN-based models. Softmax attention is able to learn a linear alignment between image pixels and target characters whereas the alignment generated by sigmoid attention is linear but much less precise. When no function is used to obtain attention weights, the model performs poorly because it lacks a precise alignment between the source and text output.
