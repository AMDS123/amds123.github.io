##### Abstract
Recently, deep learning methods have made a significant improvement in com- pressive sensing image reconstruction task. However, it still remains a problem of block effect which degrades the reconstruction results. In this paper, we pro- pose a fully-convolutional network, where the full image is directly measured with a convolutional layer. Thanks to the overlapped convolutional measure- ment, the block effect is removed. In addition, because of the jointly training of the measurement and reconstruction stages, the adaptive measurement can be obtained. Furthermore, to enhance the performance of the network, resid- ual learning is used in the reconstruction network. Experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms the existing methods in both PSNR and visual effect.

最近，深度学习方法在压缩感知图像重建任务中取得了重大进展。但是，这仍然是一个块效应的问题，会降低重建结果。在本文中，我们提出了一个完全卷积网络，其中完整的图像直接用卷积层进行测量。由于重叠的卷积测量，块效应被删除。另外，由于测量和重建阶段的联合训练，可以获得自适应测量。此外，为了提高网络的性能，在重建网络中使用剩余学习。实验结果表明，所提出的方法在PSNR和视觉效果上均优于现有方法。
