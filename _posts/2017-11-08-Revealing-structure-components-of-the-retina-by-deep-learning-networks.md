##### Abstract
Deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have demonstrated impressive performance on visual object classification tasks. In addition, it is a useful model for predication of neuronal responses recorded in visual system. However, there is still no clear understanding of what CNNs learn in terms of visual neuronal circuits. Visualizing CNN's features to obtain possible connections to neuronscience underpinnings is not easy due to highly complex circuits from the retina to higher visual cortex. Here we address this issue by focusing on single retinal ganglion cells with a simple model and electrophysiological recordings from salamanders. By training CNNs with white noise images to predicate neural responses, we found that convolutional filters learned in the end are resembling to biological components of the retinal circuit. Features represented by these filters tile the space of conventional receptive field of retinal ganglion cells. These results suggest that CNN could be used to reveal structure components of neuronal circuits.

深卷积神经网络（CNN）在视觉对象分类任务上表现出色。此外，它是预测视觉系统记录的神经元反应的有用模型。然而，对CNNs在视觉神经元电路方面的学习还不清楚。由于从视网膜到高级视觉皮层的高度复杂的电路，可视化CNN的特征以获得与神经元科学基础的可能连接是不容易的。在这里我们解决这个问题的重点是单个视网膜神经节细胞与简单的模型和蝾螈的电生理记录。通过用白噪声图像训练CNN来预测神经反应，我们发现最终得到的卷积滤波器类似于视网膜电路的生物成分。由这些滤波器代表的特征平铺了视网膜神经节细胞的常规感受野的空间。这些结果表明CNN可以用来揭示神经元回路的结构成分。
