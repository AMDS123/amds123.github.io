##### Abstract
Document classification is a challenging task with important applications. Deep learning approaches to the problem have gained much attention. Despite the progress, the proposed models do not incorporate the knowledge of the document structure in the architecture efficiently and not take into account the contexting dependent importance of words and sentences. In this paper, we propose a new approach based on convolutional neural networks, gated recurrent units and attention mechanisms for document classification tasks. The datasets IMDB Movie Reviews and Yelp were used in experiments. The proposed method improves the results of current attention-based approaches
