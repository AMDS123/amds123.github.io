##### Abstract
Control systems on unmanned vehicles are safety-critical systems whose requirements on reliability and safety are ever-increasing. Currently, testing a complex autonomous control system is an expensive and time-consuming process, which requires massive repeated experimental testing during the whole development stage. This paper presents a unified simulation and test platform for vehicle autonomous control systems aiming to significantly improve the development speed and safety level of unmanned vehicles. First, a unified modular modeling framework compatible with different types of vehicles is proposed with methods to ensure modeling credibility. Then, the simulation software system is developed by the model-based design framework, whose modular programming methods and automatic code generation functions ensure the efficiency, credibility, and standardization of the system development process. Finally, an FPGA-based real-time hardware-in-the-loop simulation platform is proposed to ensure the comprehensiveness and credibility of the simulation and test results. In the end, the proposed platform is applied to a multicopter control system. By comparing with experimental results, the accuracy and credibility of the simulation testing results are verified by using the simulation credibility assessment method proposed in our previous work. To verify the practicability of the proposed platform, several successful applications are presented for the multicopter rapid prototyping, estimation algorithm verification, autonomous flight testing, and automatic safety testing with automatic fault injection and result evaluation of unmanned vehicles.
