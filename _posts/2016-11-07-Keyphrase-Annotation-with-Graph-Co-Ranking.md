##### Abstract
Keyphrase annotation is the task of identifying textual units that represent the main content of a document. Keyphrase annotation is either carried out by extracting the most important phrases from a document, keyphrase extraction, or by assigning entries from a controlled domain-specific vocabulary, keyphrase assignment. Assignment methods are generally more reliable. They provide better-formed keyphrases, as well as keyphrases that do not occur in the document. But they are often silent on the contrary of extraction methods that do not depend on manually built resources. This paper proposes a new method to perform both keyphrase extraction and keyphrase assignment in an integrated and mutual reinforcing manner. Experiments have been carried out on datasets covering different domains of humanities and social sciences. They show statistically significant improvements compared to both keyphrase extraction and keyphrase assignment state-of-the art methods.

关键词注释是识别代表文档主要内容的文本单元的任务。 Keyphrase注释可以通过从文档中提取最重要的短语，进行关键词提取，或者通过从受控的特定于域的词汇表，关键词分配中分配条目来执行。分配方法通常更可靠。它们提供更好的关键字句，以及文档中不会出现的关键字句。但他们往往沉默相反的提取方法，不依赖于手动建立的资源。本文提出了一种新的方法来进行关键词提取和关键词分配的综合和相互加强的方式。对涵盖人文和社会科学不同领域的数据集进行了实验。与关键字提取和关键词分配最先进的方法相比，它们显示出统计学显着的改善。
