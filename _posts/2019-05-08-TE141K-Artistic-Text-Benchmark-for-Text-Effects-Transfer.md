##### Abstract
Text effects are combinations of visual elements such as outlines, colors and textures of text, which can dramatically improve its artistry. Although text effects are extensively utilized in the design industry, they are usually created by human experts due to their extreme complexity, which is laborious and not practical for normal users. In recent years, some efforts have been made for automatic text effects transfer, however, the lack of data limits the capability of transfer models. To address this problem, we introduce a new text effects dataset, TE141K, with 141,081 text effects/glyph pairs in total. Our dataset consists of 152 professionally designed text effects, rendered on glyphs including English letters, Chinese characters, Arabic numerals, etc. To the best of our knowledge, this is the largest dataset for text effects transfer as far. Based on this dataset, we propose a baseline approach named Text Effects Transfer GAN (TET-GAN), which supports the transfer of all 152 styles in one model and can efficiently extend to new styles. Finally, we conduct a comprehensive comparison where 14 style transfer models are benchmarked. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of TET-GAN both qualitatively and quantitatively, and indicate that our dataset is effective and challenging.
