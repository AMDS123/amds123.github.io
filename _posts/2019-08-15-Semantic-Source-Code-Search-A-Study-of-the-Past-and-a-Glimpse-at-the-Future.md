##### Abstract
With the recent explosion in the size and complexity of source codebases and software projects, the need for efficient source code search engines has increased dramatically. Unfortunately, existing information retrieval-based methods fail to capture the query semantics and perform well only when the query contains syntax-based keywords. Consequently, such methods will perform poorly when given high-level natural language queries. In this paper, we review existing methods for building code search engines. We also outline the open research directions and the various obstacles that stand in the way of having a universal source code search engine.
