##### Abstract
In this paper, we propose Orthogonal Generative Adversarial Networks (O-GANs). We decompose the network of discriminator orthogonally and add an extra loss into the objective of common GANs, which can enforce discriminator become an effective encoder. The same extra loss can be embedded into any kind of GANs and there is almost no increase in computation. Furthermore, we discuss the principle of our method, which is relative to the fully-exploiting of the remaining degrees of freedom of discriminator. As we know, our solution is the simplest approach to train a generative adversarial network with auto-encoding ability.
