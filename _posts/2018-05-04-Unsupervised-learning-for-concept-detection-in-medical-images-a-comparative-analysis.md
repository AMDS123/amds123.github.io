##### Abstract
As digital medical imaging becomes more prevalent and archives increase in size, representation learning exposes an interesting opportunity for enhanced medical decision support systems. On the other hand, medical imaging data is often scarce and short on annotations. In this paper, we present an assessment of unsupervised feature learning approaches for images in the biomedical literature, which can be applied to automatic biomedical concept detection. Six unsupervised representation learning methods were built, including traditional bags of visual words, autoencoders, and generative adversarial networks. Each model was trained, and their respective feature space evaluated using images from the ImageCLEF 2017 concept detection task. We conclude that it is possible to obtain more powerful representations with modern deep learning approaches, in contrast with previously popular computer vision methods. Although generative adversarial networks can provide good results, they are harder to succeed in highly varied data sets. The possibility of semi-supervised learning, as well as their use in medical information retrieval problems, are the next steps to be strongly considered.

随着数字医学成像越来越普遍，档案数量增加，表示学习为增强医疗决策支持系统提供了一个有趣的机会。另一方面，医学成像数据通常很少，并且在注释上很短。在本文中，我们提出了一种无监督的生物医学文献中的图像特征学习方法的评估，它可以应用于自动生物医学概念检测。建立了六种无监督表示学习方法，包括传统的视觉词汇包，自动编码器和生成对抗网络。训练每个模型，并使用ImageCLEF 2017概念检测任务中的图像评估其各自的特征空间。我们的结论是，与先前流行的计算机视觉方法相比，利用现代深度学习方法可以获得更强大的表示。尽管生成对抗性网络可以提供良好的结果，但它们很难在高度多样化的数据集中取得成功。半监督学习的可能性以及它们在医学信息检索问题中的使用是下一步需要强烈考虑的问题。
