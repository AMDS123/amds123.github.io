##### Abstract
Enhancement of human vision to get an insight to information content is of vital importance. The traditional histogram equalization methods have been suffering from amplified contrast with the addition of artifacts and a surprising unnatural visibility of the processed images. In order to overcome these drawbacks, this paper proposes interative, mean, and multi-threshold selection criterion with plateau limits, which consist of histogram segmentation, clipping and transformation modules. The histogram partition consists of multiple thresholding processes that divide the histogram into two parts, whereas the clipping process nicely enhances the contrast by having a check on the rate of enhancement that could be tuned. Histogram equalization to each segmented sub-histogram provides the output image with preserved brightness and enhanced contrast. Results of the present study showed that the proposed method efficiently handles the noise amplification. Further, it also preserves the brightness by retaining natural look of targeted image.

了解信息内容对提高人类视力至关重要。传统的直方图均衡方法一直受到放大的对比度的影响，其中加入了伪像和令人惊讶的不自然的处理图像的可见性。为克服这些缺陷，本文提出了直方图分割，剪切和变换模块构成的具有平台限制的交互，平均和多阈值选择准则。直方图分区由多个阈值处理组成，这些处理将直方图分成两部分，而剪切处理通过检查可以调整的增强率来很好地增强对比度。对每个分段的子直方图进行直方图均衡化，为输出图像提供保持的亮度和增强的对比度。本研究结果表明，该方法有效地处理噪声放大。此外，它还通过保持目标图像的自然外观来保持亮度。
