##### Abstract
The goal of this paper is to investigate the connection between the performance gain that can be obtained by selftraining and the similarity between the corpora used in this approach. Self-training is a semi-supervised technique designed to increase the performance of machine learning algorithms by automatically classifying instances of a task and adding these as additional training material to the same classifier. In the context of language processing tasks, this training material is mostly an (annotated) corpus. Unfortunately self-training does not always lead to a performance increase and whether it will is largely unpredictable. We show that the similarity between corpora can be used to identify those setups for which self-training can be beneficial. We consider this research as a step in the process of developing a classifier that is able to adapt itself to each new test corpus that it is presented with.

本文的目的是研究通过自我训练可以获得的性能增益和这种方法中使用的语料库之间的相似性之间的联系。自我训练是一种半监督技术，旨在通过自动分类任务实例并将其作为额外的训练材料添加到相同的分类器中，从而提高机器学习算法的性能。在语言处理任务的情况下，这个培训材料大多是（注释的）语料库。不幸的是，自我训练并不总是会导致成绩的提高，并且在很大程度上是不可预测的。我们表明，语料库之间的相似性可以用来确定那些自我训练可以是有益的设置。我们认为这个研究是在开发一个分类器的过程中的一个步骤，它能够适应每一个新的测试语料库。
