##### Abstract
Symmetric Nonnegative Matrix Factorization (SNMF) models arise naturally as simple reformulations of many standard clustering algorithms including the popular spectral clustering method. Recent work has demonstrated that an elementary instance of SNMF provides superior clustering quality compared to many classic clustering algorithms on a variety of synthetic and real world data sets. In this work, we present novel reformulations of this instance of SNMF based on the notion of variable splitting and produce two fast and effective algorithms for its optimization using i) the provably convergent Accelerated Proximal Gradient (APG) procedure and ii) a heuristic version of the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) framework. Our two algorithms present an interesting tradeoff between computational speed and mathematical convergence guarantee: while the former method is provably convergent it is considerably slower than the latter approach, for which we also provide significant but less stringent mathematical proof regarding its convergence. Through extensive experiments we show not only that the efficacy of these approaches is equal to that of the state of the art SNMF algorithm, but also that the latter of our algorithms is extremely fast being one to two orders of magnitude faster in terms of total computation time than the state of the art approach, outperforming even spectral clustering in terms of computation time on large data sets.

对称非负矩阵分解（SNMF）模型自然产生了许多标准聚类算法（包括流行的谱聚类方法）的简单重构。最近的工作表明，SNMF的基本实例与许多经典的聚类算法相比，在各种合成和现实世界的数据集上提供了出众的聚类质量。在这项工作中，我们提出了基于可变分裂概念的SNMF实例的新颖的重新构造，并且为其优化使用i）可证明的收敛加速近端梯度（APG）程序和ii）启发式版本的交替方向乘法器（ADMM）框架。我们的两种算法在计算速度和数学收敛保证之间提出了一个有趣的权衡：虽然前一种方法是可证明的收敛性，但它比后一种方法慢得多，对此我们也提供了显着但较不严格的数学证明。通过广泛的实验，我们不仅可以看出这些方法的功效与现有的SNMF算法的功效相同，而且我们后面的算法在整体计算上速度快一至两个数量级比现有技术的方法还要好，甚至在大数据集上的计算时间方面甚至优于谱聚类。
