##### Abstract
Authorship attribution, being an important problem in many areas in-cluding information retrieval, computational linguistics, law and journalism etc., has been identified as a subject of increasingly research interest in the re-cent years. In case of Author Identification task in PAN at CLEF 2015, the main focus was given on cross-genre and cross-topic author verification tasks. We have used several word-based and style-based features to identify the dif-ferences between the known and unknown problems of one given set and label the unknown ones accordingly using a Random Forest based classifier.

在许多领域（包括信息检索，计算语言学，法学和新闻学等），作者归属是近几年来越来越多研究兴趣的主题。在2015年的CLEF中，PAN中的作者识别任务主要集中在跨类别和跨主题的作者验证任务上。我们已经使用了几个基于字和风格的特征来识别一个给定集合的已知和未知问题之间的差异，并使用基于随机森林的分类器相应地标记未知的问题。
