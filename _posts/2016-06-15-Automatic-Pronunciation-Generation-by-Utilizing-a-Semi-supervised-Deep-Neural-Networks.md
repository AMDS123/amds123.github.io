##### Abstract
Phonemic or phonetic sub-word units are the most commonly used atomic elements to represent speech signals in modern ASRs. However they are not the optimal choice due to several reasons such as: large amount of effort required to handcraft a pronunciation dictionary, pronunciation variations, human mistakes and under-resourced dialects and languages. Here, we propose a data-driven pronunciation estimation and acoustic modeling method which only takes the orthographic transcription to jointly estimate a set of sub-word units and a reliable dictionary. Experimental results show that the proposed method which is based on semi-supervised training of a deep neural network largely outperforms phoneme based continuous speech recognition on the TIMIT dataset.

在现代ASR中，音素或语音子字单元是表示语音信号的最常用的原子元素。然而，由于以下几个原因，它们并不是最佳选择：手工发音词典所需的大量工作，发音变化，人为错误以及资源不足的方言和语言。在这里，我们提出了一种数据驱动的发音估计和声学建模方法，它只采用正确的转录来联合估计一组子字和一个可靠的字典。实验结果表明，所提出的基于深度神经网络的半监督训练方法在TIMIT数据集上大大优于基于音素的连续语音识别。
