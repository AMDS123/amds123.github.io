##### Abstract
Motivation: Network visualizations of complex biological datasets usually result in 'hairball' images, which do not discriminate network modules. Results: We present the EntOptLayout Cytoscape plug-in based on a recently developed network representation theory. The plug-in provides an efficient visualization of network modules, which represent major protein complexes in protein-protein interaction and signalling networks. Importantly, the tool gives a quality score of the network visualization by calculating the information loss between the input data and the visual representation showing a 3- to 25-fold improvement over conventional methods. Availability: The plug-in (running on Windows, Linux, or Mac OS) and its tutorial (both in written and video forms) can be downloaded freely under the terms of the MIT license from: <a href="http://apps.cytoscape.org/apps/entoptlayout.">this http URL</a> Contact: csermely.peter@med.semmelweis-univ.hu
