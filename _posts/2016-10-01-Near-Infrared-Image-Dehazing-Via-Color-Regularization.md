##### Abstract
Near-infrared imaging can capture haze-free near-infrared gray images and visible color images, according to physical scattering models, e.g., Rayleigh or Mie models. However, there exist serious discrepancies in brightness and image structures between the near-infrared gray images and the visible color images. The direct use of the near-infrared gray images brings about another color distortion problem in the dehazed images. Therefore, the color distortion should also be considered for near-infrared dehazing. To reflect this point, this paper presents an approach of adding a new color regularization to conventional dehazing framework. The proposed color regularization can model the color prior for unknown haze-free images from two captured images. Thus, natural-looking colors and fine details can be induced on the dehazed images. The experimental results show that the proposed color regularization model can help remove the color distortion and the haze at the same time. Also, the effectiveness of the proposed color regularization is verified by comparing with other conventional regularizations. It is also shown that the proposed color regularization can remove the edge artifacts which arise from the use of the conventional dark prior model.

根据物理散射模型，例如瑞利（Rayleigh）或米氏（Mie）模型，近红外成像可以捕获无浑浊的近红外灰色图像和可见彩色图像。然而，近红外灰度图像与可见彩色图像之间在亮度和图像结构方面存在严重的差异。直接使用近红外灰度图像会在去雾图像中带来另一种颜色失真问题。因此，对于近红外去雾，也应考虑颜色失真。为了体现这一点，本文提出了一种在常规除雾框架中增加新颜色正则化的方法。所提出的颜色正则化可以对来自两个捕获图像的未知无雾图像之前的颜色进行建模。因此，可以在去眼眩的图像上诱导自然的色彩和细节。实验结果表明，提出的颜色正则化模型可以同时帮助消除颜色失真和混浊。而且，所提出的颜色正则化的有效性通过与其他常规正则化进行比较来验证。还表明，所提出的颜色正则化可以消除由于使用传统的黑暗先验模型而产生的边缘伪影。
