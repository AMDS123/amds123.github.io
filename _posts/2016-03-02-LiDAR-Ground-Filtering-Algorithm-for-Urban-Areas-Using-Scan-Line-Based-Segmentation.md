##### Abstract
This paper addresses the task of separating ground points from airborne LiDAR point cloud data in urban areas. A novel ground filtering method using scan line segmentation is proposed here, which we call SLSGF. It utilizes the scan line information in LiDAR data to segment the LiDAR data. The similarity measurements are designed to make it possible to segment complex roof structures into a single segment as much as possible so the topological relationships between the roof and the ground are simpler, which will benefit the labeling process. In the labeling process, the initial ground segments are detected and a coarse to fine labeling scheme is applied. Data from ISPRS 2011 are used to test the accuracy of SLSGF; and our analytical and experimental results show that this method is computationally-efficient and noise-insensitive, thereby making a denoising process unnecessary before filtering.

本文针对城市机载LiDAR点云数据分离地面点的任务。本文提出了一种新的使用扫描线分割的地面滤波方法，我们称之为SLSGF。它利用LiDAR数据中的扫描线信息来分割LiDAR数据。相似性测量的目的是尽可能将复杂的屋顶结构分割成一个单一的部分，这样屋顶和地面之间的拓扑关系更简单，这将有利于贴标过程。在贴标签过程中，初始的地面部分被检测到，并且应用粗到细的标签方案。来自ISPRS 2011的数据被用来测试SLSGF的准确性;我们的分析和实验结果表明，这种方法是计算效率和噪声不敏感，从而使过滤之前不必要的去噪过程。
