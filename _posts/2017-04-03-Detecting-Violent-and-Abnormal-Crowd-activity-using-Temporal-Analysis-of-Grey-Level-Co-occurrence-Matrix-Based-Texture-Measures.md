##### Abstract
The severity of sustained injury resulting from assault-related violence can be minimised by reducing detection time. However, it has been shown that human operators perform poorly at detecting events found in video footage when presented with simultaneous feeds. We utilise computer vision techniques to develop an automated method of abnormal crowd detection that can aid a human operator in the detection of violent behaviour. We observed that behaviour in city centre environments often occur in crowded areas, resulting in individual actions being occluded by other crowd members. We propose a real-time descriptor that models crowd dynamics by encoding changes in crowd texture using temporal summaries of Grey Level Co-Occurrence Matrix (GLCM) features. We introduce a measure of inter-frame uniformity (IFU) and demonstrate that the appearance of violent behaviour changes in a less uniform manner when compared to other types of crowd behaviour. Our proposed method is computationally cheap and offers real-time description. Evaluating our method using a privately held CCTV dataset and the publicly available Violent Flows, UCF Web Abnormality, and UMN Abnormal Crowd datasets, we report a receiver operating characteristic score of 0.9782, 0.9403, 0.8218 and 0.9956 respectively.

通过减少检测时间，可以最大限度地减少与袭击有关的暴力造成的持续伤害的严重程度。然而，已经显示，当同时馈送时，操作人员在视频素材中发现的事件中表现不佳。我们利用计算机视觉技术来开发异常人群检测的自动化方法，可以帮助操作人员检测暴力行为。我们观察到城市中心环境中的行为往往发生在拥挤的地区，导致其他群众成员遮蔽个人的行为。我们提出了一个实时描述符，通过使用灰度共现度矩阵（GLCM）特性的时间总结，对人群纹理中的变化进行编码来模拟人群动态。我们介绍了一种帧间均匀性（IFU）的测量方法，并且证明，与其他类型的人群行为相比，暴力行为的外观变化不太均匀。我们提出的方法计算便宜，并提供实时描述。使用私人持有的CCTV数据集和公开可用的Violent Flows，UCF Web Abnormality和UMN Abnormal Crowd数据集评估我们的方法，我们分别报告接受者操作特征分数为0.9782,0.9403,0.8218和0.9956。
