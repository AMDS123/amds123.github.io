##### Abstract
In this paper a hierarchical model for pixel clustering and image segmentation is developed. In the model an image is hierarchically structured. The original image is treated as a set of nested images, which are capable to reversibly merge with each other. An object is defined as a structural element of an image, so that, an image is regarded as a maximal object. The simulating of none-hierarchical optimal pixel clustering by hierarchical clustering is studied. To generate a hierarchy of optimized piecewise constant image approximations, estimated by the standard deviation of approximation from the image, the conversion of any hierarchy of approximations into the hierarchy described in relation to the number of intensity levels by convex sequence of total squared errors is proposed.

##### Abstract (translated by Google)
本文提出了一种用于像素聚类和图像分割的分层模型。在模型中，图像是分层结构的。原始图像被视为一组嵌套图像，它们能够可逆地彼此合并。一个对象被定义为一个图像的结构元素，因此，一个图像被认为是一个最大的对象。研究了层次聚类对非分层最优像素聚类的模拟。为了生成优化的分段恒定图像近似的分层结构，通过从图像近似的标准偏差估计，提出了近似的任何分层结构到关于总平方误差的凸序列的强度水平的数量描述的分层结构的转换。
