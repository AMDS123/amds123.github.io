##### Abstract
In the recent years, substantial work has been done on language tagging of code-mixed data, but most of them use large amounts of data to build their models. In this article, we present three strategies for building a word level language tagger for code-mixed data using very low resources. Each of them secured an accuracy higher than our baseline model, and the best performing system got an accuracy around 91%. Combining all, the ensemble system achieved an accuracy around 92.6%.
