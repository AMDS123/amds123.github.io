##### Abstract
While there has been a success in 2D human pose estimation with convolutional neural networks (CNNs), 3D human pose estimation has not been thoroughly studied. In this paper, we tackle the 3D human pose estimation task with end-to-end learning using CNNs. Relative 3D positions between one joint and the other joints are learned via CNNs. The proposed method improves the performance of CNN with two novel ideas. First, we added 2D pose information to estimate a 3D pose from an image by concatenating 2D pose estimation result with the features from an image. Second, we have found that more accurate 3D poses are obtained by combining information on relative positions with respect to multiple joints, instead of just one root joint. Experimental results show that the proposed method achieves comparable performance to the state-of-the-art methods on Human 3.6m dataset.

虽然在卷积神经网络（CNN）的二维人体姿态估计方面已经取得了成功，但3D人体姿态估计还没有被彻底研究。在本文中，我们通过使用CNN进行端到端的学习来解决3D人体姿态估计任务。通过CNN学习一个关节和其他关节之间的相对3D位置。该方法以两种新颖的思路提高了CNN的性能。首先，通过将2D姿势估计结果与来自图像的特征相结合，从图像中添加2D姿态信息以估计3D姿态。其次，我们发现通过结合关于多个关节的相对位置的信息而不是仅一个根关节获得更准确的3D姿势。实验结果表明，该方法在人体3.6m数据集上达到了与现有技术相当的性能。
