##### Abstract
Running high-resolution physical models is computationally expensive and essential for many disciplines. Agriculture, transportation, and energy are sectors that depend on high-resolution weather models, which typically consume many hours of large High Performance Computing (HPC) systems to deliver timely results. Many users cannot afford to run the desired resolution and are forced to use low resolution output. One simple solution is to interpolate results for visualization. It is also possible to combine an ensemble of low resolution models to obtain a better prediction. However, these approaches fail to capture the redundant information and patterns in the low-resolution input that could help improve the quality of prediction. In this paper, we propose and evaluate a strategy based on a deep neural network to learn a high-resolution representation from low-resolution predictions using weather forecast as a practical use case. We take a supervised learning approach, since obtaining labeled data can be done automatically. Our results show significant improvement when compared with standard practices and the strategy is still lightweight enough to run on modest computer systems.

运行高分辨率物理模型在计算上非常昂贵并且对于许多学科来说都是必不可少农业，运输和能源是依赖于高分辨率天气模型的部门，这些模型通常需要花费数小时的大型高性能计算（HPC）系统来提供及时的结果。许多用户无法承受运行所需的分辨率并被迫使用低分辨率输出。一个简单的解决方案是插入结果以进行可视化。还可以组合低分辨率模型的集合以获得更好的预测。然而，这些方法无法捕获低分辨率输入中的冗余信息和模式，这有助于提高预测质量。在本文中，我们提出并评估基于深度神经网络的策略，以使用天气预报作为实际用例来学习低分辨率预测的高分辨率表示。我们采用监督学习方法，因为获得标记数据可以自动完成。与标准实践相比，我们的结果显示出显着的改进，并且该策略仍然足够轻，可以在适度的计算机系统上运行。
