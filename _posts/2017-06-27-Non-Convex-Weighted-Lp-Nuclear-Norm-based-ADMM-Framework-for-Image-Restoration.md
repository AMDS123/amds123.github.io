##### Abstract
Since the matrix formed by nonlocal similar patches in a natural image is of low rank, the nuclear norm minimization (NNM) has been widely used in various image processing studies. Nonetheless, nuclear norm based convex surrogate of the rank function usually over-shrinks the rank components and makes different components equally, and thus may produce a result far from the optimum. To alleviate the above-mentioned limitations of the nuclear norm, in this paper we propose a new method for image restoration via the non-convex weighted Lp nuclear norm minimization (NCW-NNM), which is able to more accurately enforce the image structural sparsity and self-similarity simultaneously. To make the proposed model tractable and robust, the alternative direction multiplier method (ADMM) is adopted to solve the associated non-convex minimization problem. Experimental results on various types of image restoration problems, including image deblurring, image inpainting and image compressive sensing (CS) recovery, demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms many current state-of-the-art methods in both the objective and the perceptual qualities.

由于在自然图像中由非局部相似斑块形成的矩阵具有低秩，所以核范数最小化（NNM）已被广泛用于各种图像处理研究中。但是，基于核范数的等级函数的凸代理通常会过度缩小等级分量，并且使得不同的分量平等，因此可能会产生远离最优的结果。为了缓解上述核范数的局限性，本文提出了一种通过非凸加权Lp核范数最小化（NCW-NNM）进行图像复原的新方法，能够更准确地执行图像结构的稀疏性和自我相似。为了使所提出的模型易于处理和鲁棒性，采用交替方向乘子法（ADMM）来解决相关的非凸最小化问题。对图像去模糊，图像修复和图像压缩感知（CS）恢复等各种类型的图像恢复问题的实验结果表明，所提出的方法在客观和感知质量方面都胜过许多当前最先进的方法。
