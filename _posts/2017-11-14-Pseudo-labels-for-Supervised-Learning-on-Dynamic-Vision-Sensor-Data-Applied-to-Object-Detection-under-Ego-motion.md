##### Abstract
In recent years, dynamic vision sensors (DVS), also known as event-based cameras or neuromorphic sensors, have seen increased use due to various advantages over traditional frame-based cameras. Its high temporal resolution overcomes motion blurring, its high dynamic range overcomes extreme illumination conditions and its low power consumption makes it suitable for platforms such as drones and self-driving cars. While frame-based computer vision is mature due to the large amounts of data and ground truth available, event-based computer vision is still a work in progress as data sets are not as aplenty and ground truth is scarce for tasks such as object detection. In this paper, we suggest a way to overcome the lack of labeled ground truth by introducing a simple method to generate pseudo-labels for dynamic vision sensor data, assuming that the corresponding frame-based data is also available. These pseudo-labels can be treated as ground truth when training on supervised learning algorithms, and we show, for the first time, event-based car detection under ego-motion in a realistic environment at 100 frames per second with an average precision of 41.7% relative to pseudo-ground truth.

近年来，动态视觉传感器（DVS）（也被称为基于事件的相机或神经形态传感器）由于与传统的基于框架的相机相比的各种优点而已经被增加使用。其高时间分辨率克服了运动模糊，其高动态范围克服了极端的照明条件，其低功耗使其适用于无人驾驶飞机和自动驾驶汽车等平台。虽然基于帧的计算机视觉由于大量的数据和可用的事实而成熟，但基于事件的计算机视觉仍然是一个正在进行的工作，因为数据集不够多，而且对象检测等任务的实际情况很少。在本文中，假设相应的基于帧的数据也是可用的，我们提出了一种通过引入生成用于动态视觉传感器数据的伪标签的简单方法来克服缺乏标记的基本事实的方法。在训练有监督学习算法时，这些伪标签可以被视为地面真实性，并且首次在实际环境中以100帧/秒的速度自我运动地进行基于事件的车辆检测，平均精度为41.7 ％相对于伪基础的事实。
