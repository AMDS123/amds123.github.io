##### Abstract
Automatically scene understanding using machine learning algorithms has been widely applied to different industries to reduce the cost of manual labor. Nowadays, insurance companies launch express vehicle insurance claim and settlement by allowing customers uploading pictures taken by mobile devices. This kind of insurance claim is treated as small claim and can be processed either manually or automatically in a quick fashion. However, due to the increasing amount of claims every day, system or people are likely to be fooled by repeated claims for identical case leading to big lost to insurance companies.Thus, an anti-fraud checking before processing the claim is necessary. We create the first data set of car damage images collected from internet and local parking lots. In addition, we proposed an approach to generate robust deep features by locating the damages accurately and efficiently in the images. The state-of-the-art real-time object detector YOLO \cite{redmon2016you}is modified to train and discover damage region as an important part of the pipeline. Both local and global deep features are extracted using VGG model\cite{Simonyan14c}, which are fused later for more robust system performance. Experiments show our approach is effective in preventing fraud claims as well as meet the requirement to speed up the insurance claim prepossessing.

使用机器学习算法自动进行场景理解已被广泛应用于不同的行业，以降低人工成本。如今，保险公司通过允许客户上传移动设备拍摄的照片来启动快速车辆保险索赔和结算。这种保险索赔被视为小额索赔，可以手动或自动快速处理。然而，由于每天索赔数量不断增加，系统或人员很可能被同一案件的重复索赔欺骗，从而导致保险公司遭受重大损失。因此，在处理索赔之前进行反欺诈检查是必要的。我们创建了从因特网和当地停车场收集的第一批汽车损坏图像数据集。另外，我们提出了一种通过在图像中准确有效地定位损害来生成强大深层特征的方法。最先进的实时对象检测器YOLO \ cite {redmon2016you}被修改以训练和发现损坏区域，作为管道的重要组成部分。使用VGG模型\ cite {Simonyan14c}提取局部和全局深度特征，之后将其融合以获得更强大的系统性能。实验表明，我们的方法可有效防止欺诈索赔，并符合加速保险索赔前提的要求。
