##### Abstract
This paper presents an efficient object detection method from satellite imagery. Among a number of machine learning algorithms, we proposed a combination of two convolutional neural networks (CNN) aimed at high precision and high recall, respectively. We validated our models using golf courses as target objects. The proposed deep learning method demonstrated higher accuracy than previous object identification methods.
