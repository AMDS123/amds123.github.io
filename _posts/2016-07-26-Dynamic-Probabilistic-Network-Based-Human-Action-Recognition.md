##### Abstract
This paper examines use of dynamic probabilistic networks (DPN) for human action recognition. The actions of lifting objects and walking in the room, sitting in the room and neutral standing pose were used for testing the classification. The research used the dynamic interrelation between various different regions of interest (ROI) on the human body (face, body, arms, legs) and the time series based events related to the these ROIs. This dynamic links are then used to recognize the human behavioral aspects in the scene. First a model is developed to identify the human activities in an indoor scene and this model is dependent on the key features and interlinks between the various dynamic events using DPNs. The sub ROI are classified with DPN to associate the combined interlink with a specific human activity. The recognition accuracy performance between indoor (controlled lighting conditions) is compared with the outdoor lighting conditions. The accuracy in outdoor scenes was lower than the controlled environment.

本文考察动态概率网络（DPN）在人类行为识别中的应用。在房间里举起物体，走在房间里，坐在房间中立的姿势被用来测试分类。这项研究使用了人体（脸部，身体，手臂，腿部）上各种不同感兴趣区域（ROI）之间的动态相关性以及与这些ROI相关的基于时间序列的事件。这个动态链接然后用于识别场景中的人类行为方面。首先开发一个模型来识别室内场景中的人类活动，这个模型依赖于使用DPN的各种动态事件之间的关键特征和相互关联。子投资回报率被分类为DPN，以将组合的相互链接与特定的人类活动相关联。将室内（受控照明条件）之间的识别精度性能与室外照明条件进行比较。户外场景的准确度低于受控环境。
