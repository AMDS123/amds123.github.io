##### Abstract
Subspace learning is an important problem, which has many applications in image and video processing. It can be used to find a low-dimensional representation of signals and images. But in many applications, the desired signal is heavily distorted by outliers and noise, which negatively affect the learned subspace. In this work, we present a novel algorithm for learning a subspace for signal representation, in the presence of structured outliers and noise. The proposed algorithm tries to jointly detect the outliers and learn the subspace for images. We present an alternating optimization algorithm for solving this problem, which iterates between learning the subspace and finding the outliers. This algorithm has been trained on a large number of image patches, and the learned subspace is used for image segmentation, and is shown to achieve better segmentation results than prior methods, including least absolute deviation fitting, k-means clustering based segmentation in DjVu, and shape primitive extraction and coding algorithm.

子空间学习是一个重要的问题，在图像和视频处理中有很多应用。它可以用来找到信号和图像的低维表示。但在许多应用中，期望的信号被异常值和噪声严重扭曲，这对学习子空间产生负面影响。在这项工作中，我们提出了一种新的算法来学习子空间的信号表示，在存在结构异常值和噪声。该算法尝试联合检测异常值，并学习图像的子空间。我们提出了一个交替优化算法来解决这个问题，它在学习子空间和发现异常值之间进行迭代。该算法在大量图像块上进行训练，并将学习后的子空间用于图像分割，实现了比现有方法更好的分割结果，包括最小绝对偏差拟合，基于k-means聚类的DjVu分割，并形成原始的提取和编码算法。
