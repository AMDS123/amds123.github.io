##### Abstract
A flashover occurs when a fire spreads very rapidly through crevices due to intense heat. Flashovers present one of the most frightening and challenging fire phenomena to those who regularly encounter them: firefighters. Firefighters' safety and lives often depend on their ability to predict flashovers before they occur. Typical pre-flashover fire characteristics include dark smoke, high heat, and rollover ("angel fingers") and can be quantified by color, size, and shape. Using a color video stream from a firefighter's body camera, we applied generative adversarial neural networks for image enhancement. The neural networks were trained to enhance very dark fire and smoke patterns in videos and monitor dynamic changes in smoke and fire areas. Preliminary tests with limited flashover training videos showed that we predicted a flashover as early as 55 seconds before it occurred.

当火由于高温而迅速地穿过缝隙时，发生闪络。对于那些经常遇到他们的人来说，闪电现象是最令人恐惧和具有挑战性的火灾现象之一：消防员。消防员的安全和生命往往取决于他们在发生事故之前预测闪络的能力。典型的预闪火特征包括黑烟，高热和翻转（“天使手指”），并且可以通过颜色，大小和形状来量化。使用来自消防员身体照相机的彩色视频流，我们应用生成敌对​​神经网络进行图像增强。训练神经网络以增强视频中非常黑暗的火焰和烟雾模式，并监测烟雾和火灾区域的动态变化。闪络训练视频有限的初步测试表明，我们预测闪络发生在55秒之前。
