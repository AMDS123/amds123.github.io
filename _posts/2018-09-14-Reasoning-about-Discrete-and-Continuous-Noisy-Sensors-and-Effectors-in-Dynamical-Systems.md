##### Abstract
Among the many approaches for reasoning about degrees of belief in the presence of noisy sensing and acting, the logical account proposed by Bacchus, Halpern, and Levesque is perhaps the most expressive. While their formalism is quite general, it is restricted to fluents whose values are drawn from discrete finite domains, as opposed to the continuous domains seen in many robotic applications. In this work, we show how this limitation in that approach can be lifted. By dealing seamlessly with both discrete distributions and continuous densities within a rich theory of action, we provide a very general logical specification of how belief should change after acting and sensing in complex noisy domains.

在存在噪声感知和行为的信念程度推理的众多方法中，Bacchus，Halpern和Levesque提出的逻辑叙述可能是最具表现力的。虽然它们的形式主义非常普遍，但它仅限于流量，其值来自离散的有限域，而不是许多机器人应用中的连续域。在这项工作中，我们展示了如何解除这种方法的局限性。通过在丰富的行动理论中无缝地处理离散分布和连续密度，我们提供了一个非常一般的逻辑规范，说明在复杂的噪声域中作用和感知之后信念应该如何变化。
