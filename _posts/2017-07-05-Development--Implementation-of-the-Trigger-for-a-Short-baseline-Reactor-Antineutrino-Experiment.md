##### Abstract
SoLid, located at SCK-CEN in Mol, Belgium, is a reactor antineutrino experiment at a very short baseline of 5.5 - 10m aiming at the search for sterile neutrinos and for high precision measurement of the neutrino energy spectrum of Uranium-235. It uses a novel approach using Lithium-6 sheets and PVT cubes as scintillators for tagging the Inverse Beta-Decay products (neutron and positron). Being located overground and close to the BR2 research reactor, the experiment faces a large amount of backgrounds. Efficient real-time background and noise rejection is essential in order to increase the signal-background ratio for precise oscillation measurement and decrease data production to a rate which can be handled by the online software. Therefore, a reliable distinction between the neutrons and background signals is crucial. This can be performed online with a dedicated firmware trigger. A peak counting algorithm and an algorithm measuring time over threshold have been identified as performing well both in terms of efficiency and fake rate, and have been implemented onto an FPGA. After having introduced the experimental and theoretical background of neutrino oscillation physics, as well as SoLid's detector technology, read-out system and trigger scheme, the thesis presents the design of the firmware neutron trigger implemented by applying machine learning methods.

位于比利时莫尔的SCK-CEN的SoLid是一个反应堆反中微子实验，在5.5  -  10m的很短的基线上，旨在搜索不育中微子和高精度测量铀-235的中微子能谱。它采用了一种新颖的方法，使用锂-6片和PVT立方体作为闪烁器来标记反向β衰变产物（中子和正电子）。位于地面上，靠近BR2研究堆，实验面临着大量的背景。高效的实时背景和噪声抑制对于提高精确振荡测量的信号背景比率并将数据产生降低到可由在线软件处理的速率是至关重要的。因此，中子和背景信号的可靠区分是至关重要的。这可以通过专用的固件触发器在线执行。峰值计数算法和测量时间超过阈值的算法在效率和假冒率方面均表现出色，并已在FPGA上实现。在介绍了中微子振荡物理的实验和理论背景以及SoLid探测器技术，读出系统和触发方案之后，论文提出了应用机器学习方法实现的固件中子触发器的设计。
