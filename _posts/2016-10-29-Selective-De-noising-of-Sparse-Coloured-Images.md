##### Abstract
Since time immemorial, noise has been a constant source of disturbance to the various entities known to mankind. Noise models of different kinds have been developed to study noise in more detailed fashion over the years. Image processing, particularly, has extensively implemented several algorithms to reduce noise in photographs and pictorial documents to alleviate the effect of noise. Images with sparse colours-lesser number of distinct colours in them-are common nowadays, especially in astronomy and astrophysics where black and white colours form the main components. Additive noise of Gaussian type is the most common form of noise to be studied and analysed in majority of communication channels, namely-satellite links, mobile base station to local cellular tower communication channel,et. al. Most of the time, we encounter images from astronomical sources being distorted with noise maximally as they travel long distance from telescopes in outer space to Earth. Considering Additive White Gaussian Noise(AWGN) to be the common noise in these long distance channels, this paper provides an insight and an algorithmic approach to pixel-specific de-noising of sparse-coloured images affected by AWGN. The paper concludes with some essential future avenues and applications of this de-noising method in industry and academia.

自远古时代以来，噪音一直是人类已知的各种实体干扰源。多年来，为了更详细地研究噪音，开发了各种噪音模型。特别是图像处理已经广泛实施了几种算法来降低照片和图像文件中的噪声，以减轻噪声的影响。稀疏的图像 - 其中不同颜色的图像 - 现在很常见，特别是在天文学和天体物理学中，黑色和白色是主要成分。高斯型的加性噪声​​是在大多数通信信道中研究和分析的最常见的噪声形式，即卫星链路，移动基站到本地蜂窝塔通信信道等。人。大多数时候，我们遇到来自天文源的图像，当它们从外太空的望远镜到地球长距离传播时，最大程度地受到噪声的扭曲。考虑到可加性高斯白噪声（AWGN）是这些长距离通道中的常见噪声，本文提出了一种深入了解AWGN影响稀疏彩色图像像素特定去噪的算法。本文总结了工业界和学术界对这种去噪方法的一些重要的未来途径和应用。
