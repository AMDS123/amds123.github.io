##### Abstract
Person re identification is a challenging retrieval task that requires matching a person's acquired image across non overlapping camera views. In this paper we propose an effective approach that incorporates both the fine and coarse pose information of the person to learn a discriminative embedding. In contrast to the recent direction of explicitly modeling body parts or correcting for misalignment based on these, we show that a rather straightforward inclusion of acquired camera view and/or the detected joint locations into a convolutional neural network helps to learn a very effective representation. To increase retrieval performance, re-ranking techniques based on computed distances have recently gained much attention. We propose a new unsupervised and automatic re-ranking framework that achieves state-of-the-art re-ranking performance. We show that in contrast to the current state-of-the-art re-ranking methods our approach does not require to compute new rank lists for each image pair (e.g., based on reciprocal neighbors) and performs well by using simple direct rank list based comparison or even by just using the already computed euclidean distances between the images. We show that both our learned representation and our re-ranking method achieve state-of-the-art performance on a number of challenging surveillance image and video datasets. The code is available online at: this https URL

重新识别人是一个具有挑战性的检索任务，需要在不重叠的摄像机视图中匹配一个人的获取图像。在本文中，我们提出了一个有效的方法，结合人的精细和粗糙的姿态信息来学习一个判别嵌入。与最近明确建模身体部位的方向或基于这些方位校正错位的方向相反，我们展示了将采集的相机视图和/或检测到的关节位置包含在卷积神经网络中相当直接的帮助学习非常有效的表示。为了提高检索性能，基于计算距离的重新排序技术近来获得了很多关注。我们提出了一个新的无监督和自动重新排名框架，实现了最先进的排名表现。我们表明，与目前最先进的重新排序方法相比，我们的方法不需要为每个图像对（例如，基于相互邻居）计算新的秩列表，并且通过使用简单的直接排序列表或者甚至仅仅使用已经计算的图像之间的欧几里德距离。我们展示了我们的学习表示和我们的重新排序方法在一些具有挑战性的监控图像和视频数据集上实现了最先进的性能。该代码可通过以下网址获得：https：
