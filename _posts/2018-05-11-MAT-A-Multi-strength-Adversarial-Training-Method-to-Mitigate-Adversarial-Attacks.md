##### Abstract
Some recent works revealed that deep neural networks (DNNs) are vulnerable to so-called adversarial attacks where input examples are intentionally perturbed to fool DNNs. In this work, we revisit the DNN training process that includes adversarial examples into the training dataset so as to improve DNN's resilience to adversarial attacks, namely, adversarial training. Our experiments show that different adversarial strengths, i.e., perturbation levels of adversarial examples, have different working zones to resist the attack. Based on the observation, we propose a multi-strength adversarial training method (MAT) that combines the adversarial training examples with different adversarial strengths to defend adversarial attacks. Two training structures - mixed MAT and parallel MAT - are developed to facilitate the tradeoffs between training time and memory occupation. Our results show that MAT can substantially minimize the accuracy degradation of deep learning systems to adversarial attacks on MNIST, CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and SVHN.

最近的一些研究表明，深层神经网络（DNNs）很容易受到所谓的敌对攻击，其中输入示例有意扰乱愚蠢的DNN。在这项工作中，我们重新审视了包含敌对案例的DNN培训流程，以提高DNN对敌对攻击的抵御能力，即对抗性培训。我们的实验表明，不同的对抗强度，即对抗性事例的扰动水平，具有不同的工作区域来抵抗攻击。基于观察，我们提出了一种多强度对抗训练方法（MAT），它将对抗训练的例子与不同的对抗优势结合起来，以防御敌对对手的攻击。两种训练结构 - 混合MAT和并行MAT--被开发用于促进训练时间和记忆占用之间的权衡。我们的研究结果表明MAT可以将深度学习系统的准确度降低降至MNIST，CIFAR-10，CIFAR-100和SVHN的敌对攻击。
