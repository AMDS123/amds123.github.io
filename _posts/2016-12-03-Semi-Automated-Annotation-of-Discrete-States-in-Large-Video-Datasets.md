##### Abstract
We propose a framework for semi-automated annotation of video frames where the video is of an object that at any point in time can be labeled as being in one of a finite number of discrete states. A Hidden Markov Model (HMM) is used to model (1) the behavior of the underlying object and (2) the noisy observation of its state through an image processing algorithm. The key insight of this approach is that the annotation of frame-by-frame video can be reduced from a problem of labeling every single image to a problem of detecting a transition between states of the underlying objected being recording on video. The performance of the framework is evaluated on a driver gaze classification dataset composed of 16,000,000 images that were fully annotated over 6,000 hours of direct manual annotation labor. On this dataset, we achieve a 13x reduction in manual annotation for an average accuracy of 99.1% and a 84x reduction for an average accuracy of 91.2%.

我们提出了一种视频帧的半自动注释框架，其中视频是在任何时间点可以标记为处于有限数量的离散状态之一的对象。隐马尔可夫模型（HMM）用于模拟（1）基础对象的行为和（2）通过图像处理算法对其状态的噪声观察。这种方法的关键洞察在于，逐帧视频的注释可以从标记每个单个图像的问题减少到检测在视频上记录的潜在对象的状态之间的转换的问题。该框架的性能是在一个驾驶员注视分类数据集上进行评估的，该数据集由1600万张图像组成，这些图像在6,000小时的直接人工注释劳动中被充分注释。在这个数据集中，我们实现了手动注释的13倍缩减，平均准确率为99.1％，平均准确率为91.2％，减少了84倍。
