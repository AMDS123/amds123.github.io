##### Abstract
This erratum addresses an error in the text of Lo et al. (2013) and more importantly corrects a computational error that was made in all previously published relativistic computations of absolute pulse waveform fluxes produced by hot spots on rotating stars that followed the radiation forward in time from the star to the observer. These computations used an incorrect expression for the differential emitting area on the stellar surface, as measured in the comoving frame. This erratum explains this error, lists all the published papers that contain results affected by this error, and summarizes in a general way why and how the results in Lo et al. (2013) were affected by this error, in a way that makes clear why and how the results in the other papers were affected. The idealized radiation spectra, beaming patterns, and spot shapes assumed in many of the previously reported computations of pulse waveforms very likely introduced systematic errors that are much larger than the relatively small errors introduced by using an incorrect expression for the differential emitting area. This erratum also corrects an error in the caption of Figure 5, an error in the text on page 19, and an incomplete description of our results on page 24.
