##### Abstract
This paper presents a new method for 3D shape reconstruction based on two existing methods. A 3D reconstruction from a single photograph is introduced by both papers: the first one uses a photograph and a set of existing 3D model to generate the 3D object in the photograph, while the second one uses a photograph and a selected similar model to create the 3D object in the photograph. According to their difference, we propose a relaxation based method for more accurate correspondence establishment and shape recovery. The experiment demonstrates promising results compared to the state-of-the-art work on 3D shape estimation.

本文提出了一种基于两种现有方法的三维形状重建的新方法。这两篇论文都介绍了一张照片的三维重建：第一张照片和一组现有的三维模型在照片中生成三维物体，而第二张使用照片和选定的相似模型创建照片中的3D对象。根据它们的不同，我们提出了一种基于放松的方法来更精确地建立信函和恢复形状。与最先进的三维形状估计工作相比，该实验显示出了令人鼓舞的结果。
