##### Abstract
Recent years have seen significant market penetration for voice-based personal assistants such as Apple's Siri. However, despite this success, user take-up is frustratingly low. This position paper argues that there is a habitability gap caused by the inevitable mismatch between the capabilities and expectations of human users and the features and benefits provided by contemporary technology. Suggestions are made as to how such problems might be mitigated, but a more worrisome question emerges: "is spoken language all-or-nothing"? The answer, based on contemporary views on the special nature of (spoken) language, is that there may indeed be a fundamental limit to the interaction that can take place between mismatched interlocutors (such as humans and machines). However, it is concluded that interactions between native and non-native speakers, or between adults and children, or even between humans and dogs, might provide critical inspiration for the design of future speech-based human-machine interaction.

##### Abstract (translated by Google)
近年来，苹果的Siri等基于语音的个人助理的市场渗透率显着提高。但是，尽管取得了这样的成功，但用户的增长却令人沮丧。本立场文件认为，人类用户的能力和期望与当代技术提供的特点和好处之间不可避免的不匹配造成了可居住性差距。对于如何减轻这些问题提出了一些建议，但是更令人担忧的问题是：“口语是全语无措”？根据当代关于（口头）语言的特殊性的观点，答案是对于不匹配的对话者（例如人类和机器）之间可能发生的相互作用确实存在根本的限制。然而，可以得出结论：本土与非母语人士之间，或成人与儿童之间，甚至人与狗之间的相互作用，可能为未来基于言语的人机交互的设计提供重要的启示。
