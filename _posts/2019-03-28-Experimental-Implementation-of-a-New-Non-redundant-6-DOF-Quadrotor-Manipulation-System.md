##### Abstract
This paper presents an experimental validation of a new quadrotor-based aerial manipulator. A quadrotor is equipped with a 2-DOF robotic arm that is designed with a new topology to enable the end-effector of the whole system to track a 6-DOF trajectory. An identification experiment is carried out to find out the system parameters. The mathematical model of the whole system is presented. A measurement scheme is proposed to get the accurate pose of the vehicle considering the motion of the manipulator below the quadrotor. The system controller is designed and implemented based on PID with a gravity compensation algorithm. System simulation is implemented in the MATLAB/SIMULINK environment with real system parameters, to better emulate a realistic setup. Real-time Experiments are conducted. Both simulation and experimental results show the feasibility and a satisfactory efficiency of the proposed system in achieving the position holding and transferring an object to a specific target position.
