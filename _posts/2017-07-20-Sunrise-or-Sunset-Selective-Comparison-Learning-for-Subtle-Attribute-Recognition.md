##### Abstract
The difficulty of image recognition has gradually increased from general category recognition to fine-grained recognition and to the recognition of some subtle attributes such as temperature and geolocation. In this paper, we try to focus on the classification between sunrise and sunset and hope to give a hint about how to tell the difference in subtle attributes. Sunrise vs. sunset is a difficult recognition task, which is challenging even for humans. Towards understanding this new problem, we first collect a new dataset made up of over one hundred webcams from different places. Since existing algorithmic methods have poor accuracy, we propose a new pairwise learning strategy to learn features from selective pairs of images. Experiments show that our approach surpasses baseline methods by a large margin and achieves better results even compared with humans. We also apply our approach to existing subtle attribute recognition problems, such as temperature estimation, and achieve state-of-the-art results.

图像识别的难度从普通类别识别逐渐增加到细粒度识别，以及识别温度和地理位置等一些微妙的属性。本文试图以日出与日落之间的分类为重点，希望对如何区分微妙的属性提供一些线索。日出与日落是一项艰巨的识别任务，即使对于人类也是一个挑战。为了理解这个新问题，我们首先收集来自不同地方的超过一百个摄像头组成的新数据集。由于现有的算法方法精度较差，我们提出了一种新的成对学习策略来学习选择性图像对的特征。实验表明，我们的方法大大超过了基线方法，甚至与人类相比也取得了更好的结果。我们也将我们的方法应用于现有的微妙的属性识别问题，如温度估计，并达到最新的结果。
