##### Abstract
Machine learning (ML) architectures such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have garnered considerable recent attention in the study of quantum many-body systems. However, advanced ML approaches such as gated recurrent neural networks (RNNs) have seldom been applied to such contexts. Here we demonstrate that a special class of RNNs known as long short-term memory (LSTM) networks is capable of learning and accurately predicting the time evolution of one-dimensional (1D) Ising model with simultaneous transverse and parallel magnetic fields, as quantitatively corroborated by relative entropy measurements and magnetization between the predicted and exact state distributions. In this unsupervised learning task, the many-body state evolution was predicted in an autoregressive way from an initial state, without any guidance or knowledge of any Hamiltonian. Our work paves the way for future applications of advanced ML methods in quantum many-body dynamics without relying on the explicit form of the Hamiltonian.
