##### Abstract
Function word adjacency networks (WANs) are used to study the authorship of plays from the Early Modern English period. In these networks, nodes are function words and directed edges between two nodes represent the relative frequency of directed co-appearance of the two words. For every analyzed play, a WAN is constructed and these are aggregated to generate author profile networks. We first study the similarity of writing styles between Early English playwrights by comparing the profile WANs. The accuracy of using WANs for authorship attribution is then demonstrated by attributing known plays among six popular playwrights. Moreover, the WAN method is shown to outperform other frequency-based methods on attributing Early English plays. In addition, WANs are shown to be reliable classifiers even when attributing collaborative plays. For several plays of disputed co-authorship, a deeper analysis is performed by attributing every act and scene separately, in which we both corroborate existing breakdowns and provide evidence of new assignments.

功能词邻接网络（WANs）被用来研究早期现代英语时期戏剧的作者。在这些网络中，节点是功能词，两个节点之间的有向边表示两个词的有向共同出现的相对频率。对于每一个分析的游戏，构建一个广域网，并且这些广告被聚合以生成作者概况网络。我们首先通过比较简介广域网来研究早期英语剧作家的写作风格的相似性。然后通过将已知的戏剧归因于六个流行剧作家之间来证明使用WAN作为署名归因的准确性。而且，广域网方法在早期英语播放中的表现优于其他基于频率的方法。另外，即使归因于协作游戏，WAN也被证明是可靠的分类器。对于有争议的合着作品的几个戏剧，进行更深入的分析，分别归因于每一个行为和场景，其中我们都证实现有的故障，并提供新的任务的证据。
