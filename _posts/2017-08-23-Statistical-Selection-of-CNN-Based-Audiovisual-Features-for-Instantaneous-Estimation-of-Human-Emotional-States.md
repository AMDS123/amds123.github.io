##### Abstract
Automatic prediction of continuous-level emotional state requires selection of suitable affective features to develop a regression system based on supervised machine learning. This paper investigates the performance of features statistically learned using convolutional neural networks for instantaneously predicting the continuous dimensions of emotional states. Features with minimum redundancy and maximum relevancy are chosen by using the mutual information-based selection process. The performance of frame-by-frame prediction of emotional state using the moderate length features as proposed in this paper is evaluated on spontaneous and naturalistic human-human conversation of RECOLA database. Experimental results show that the proposed model can be used for instantaneous prediction of emotional state with an accuracy higher than traditional audio or video features that are used for affective computation.

自动预测连续水平的情绪状态需要选择合适的情感特征来开发基于监督机器学习的回归系统。本文研究了使用卷积神经网络统计学习的特征的性能，用于瞬时预测情绪状态的连续维度。通过使用基于互信息的选择过程来选择具有最小冗余和最大相关性的特征。利用本文提出的中等长度特征，对RECOLA数据库的自发和自然的人 - 人对话，评估情感状态的逐帧预测性能。实验结果表明，所提出的模型可以用于情感状态的瞬时预测，其精确度高于用于情感计算的传统音频或视频特征。
