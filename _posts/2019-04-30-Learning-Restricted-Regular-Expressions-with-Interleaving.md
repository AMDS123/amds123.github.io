##### Abstract
The advantages for the presence of an XML schema for XML documents are numerous. However, many XML documents in practice are not accompanied by a schema or by a valid schema. Relax NG is a popular and powerful schema language, which supports the unconstrained interleaving operator. Focusing on the inference of Relax NG, we propose a new subclass of regular expressions with interleaving and design a polynomial inference algorithm. Then we conducted a series of experiments based on large-scale real data and on three XML data corpora, and experimental results show that our subclass has a better practicality than previous ones, and the regular expressions inferred by our algorithm are more precise.
