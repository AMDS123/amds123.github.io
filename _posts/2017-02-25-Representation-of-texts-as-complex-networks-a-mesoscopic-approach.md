##### Abstract
Statistical techniques that analyze texts, referred to as text analytics, have departed from the use of simple word count statistics towards a new paradigm. Text mining now hinges on a more sophisticated set of methods, including the representations in terms of complex networks. While well-established word-adjacency (co-occurrence) methods successfully grasp syntactical features of written texts, they are unable to represent important aspects of textual data, such as its topical structure, i.e. the sequence of subjects developing at a mesoscopic level along the text. Such aspects are often overlooked by current methodologies. In order to grasp the mesoscopic characteristics of semantical content in written texts, we devised a network model which is able to analyze documents in a multi-scale fashion. In the proposed model, a limited amount of adjacent paragraphs are represented as nodes, which are connected whenever they share a minimum semantical content. To illustrate the capabilities of our model, we present, as a case example, a qualitative analysis of "Alice's Adventures in Wonderland". We show that the mesoscopic structure of a document, modeled as a network, reveals many semantic traits of texts. Such an approach paves the way to a myriad of semantic-based applications. In addition, our approach is illustrated in a machine learning context, in which texts are classified among real texts and randomized instances.

##### Abstract (translated by Google)
分析文本的统计技术，被称为文本分析，已经脱离了使用简单的字数统计向新的范式。文本挖掘现在取决于更复杂的一套方法，包括复杂网络的表示。虽然成熟的单词邻接（同现）方法成功地掌握了书面文本的句法特征，但它们不能代表文本数据的重要方面，例如它的主题结构，即沿着文本。目前的方法往往忽略了这些方面。为了掌握书面文本中语义内容的细观特征，我们设计了一个能够以多尺度的方式分析文档的网络模型。在所提出的模型中，将有限数量的相邻段落表示为节点，只要它们共享最小的语义内容就连接起来。为了说明我们模型的功能，我们以“爱丽丝梦游仙境”的定性分析为例。我们表明，作为一个网络建模文档的细观结构，揭示了文本的许多语义特征。这种方法为无数基于语义的应用程序铺平了道路。另外，我们的方法在机器学习环境中进行说明，其中文本被分类为实际文本和随机实例。
