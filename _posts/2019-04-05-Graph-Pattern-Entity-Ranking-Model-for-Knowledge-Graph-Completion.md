##### Abstract
Knowledge graphs have evolved rapidly in recent years and their usefulness has been demonstrated in many artificial intelligence tasks. However, knowledge graphs often have lots of missing facts. To solve this problem, many knowledge graph embedding models have been developed to populate knowledge graphs and these have shown outstanding performance. However, knowledge graph embedding models are so-called black boxes, and the user does not know how the information in a knowledge graph is processed and the models can be difficult to interpret. In this paper, we utilize graph patterns in a knowledge graph to overcome such problems. Our proposed model, the {\it graph pattern entity ranking model} (GRank), constructs an entity ranking system for each graph pattern and evaluates them using a ranking measure. By doing so, we can find graph patterns which are useful for predicting facts. Then, we perform link prediction tasks on standard datasets to evaluate our GRank method. We show that our approach outperforms other state-of-the-art approaches such as ComplEx and TorusE for standard metrics such as HITS@{\it n} and MRR. Moreover, our model is easily interpretable because the output facts are described by graph patterns.
