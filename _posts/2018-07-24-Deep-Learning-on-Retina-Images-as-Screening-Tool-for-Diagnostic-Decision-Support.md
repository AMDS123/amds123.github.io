##### Abstract
In this project, we developed a deep learning system applied to human retina images for medical diagnostic decision support. The retina images were provided by EyePACS. These images were used in the framework of a Kaggle contest, whose purpose to identify diabetic retinopathy signs through an automatic detection system. Using as inspiration one of the solutions proposed in the contest, we implemented a model that successfully detects diabetic retinopathy from retina images. After a carefully designed preprocessing, the images were used as input to a deep convolutional neural network (CNN). The CNN performed a feature extraction process followed by a classification stage, which allowed the system to differentiate between healthy and ill patients using five categories. Our model was able to identify diabetic retinopathy in the patients with an agreement rate of 76.73% with respect to the medical expert's labels for the test data.

在这个项目中，我们开发了一个应用于人类视网膜图像的深度学习系统，用于医学诊断决策支持。视网膜图像由EyePACS提供。这些图像用于Kaggle比赛的框架，其目的是通过自动检测系统识别糖尿病视网膜病变。使用竞赛中提出的解决方案作为灵感之一，我们实施了一个模型，成功检测视网膜图像中的糖尿病视网膜病变。经过精心设计的预处理后，图像被用作深度卷积神经网络（CNN）的输入。 CNN执行特征提取过程，然后进行分类阶段，允许系统使用五个类别区分健康和病患者。我们的模型能够识别患者的糖尿病视网膜病变，协议率为76.73％，相对于医学专家的测试数据标签。
