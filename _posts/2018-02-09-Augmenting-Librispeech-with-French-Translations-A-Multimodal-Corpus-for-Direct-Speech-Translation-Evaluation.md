##### Abstract
Recent works in spoken language translation (SLT) have attempted to build end-to-end speech-to-text translation without using source language transcription during learning or decoding. However, while large quantities of parallel texts (such as Europarl, OpenSubtitles) are available for training machine translation systems, there are no large (100h) and open source parallel corpora that include speech in a source language aligned to text in a target language. This paper tries to fill this gap by augmenting an existing (monolingual) corpus: LibriSpeech. This corpus, used for automatic speech recognition, is derived from read audiobooks from the LibriVox project, and has been carefully segmented and aligned. After gathering French e-books corresponding to the English audio-books from LibriSpeech, we align speech segments at the sentence level with their respective translations and obtain 236h of usable parallel data. This paper presents the details of the processing as well as a manual evaluation conducted on a small subset of the corpus. This evaluation shows that the automatic alignments scores are reasonably correlated with the human judgments of the bilingual alignment quality. We believe that this corpus (which is made available online) is useful for replicable experiments in direct speech translation or more general spoken language translation experiments.

最近在口语翻译（SLT）方面的工作试图在学习或解码过程中不使用源语言转录来建立端到端的语音到文本翻译。然而，虽然大量的并行文本（如Europarl，OpenSubtitles）可用于训练机器翻译系统，但没有大型（100小时）和开源平行语料库，其中包括源语言的语音与目标语言中的文本对齐。本文试图通过扩充现有的（单语言）语料库来填补这个空白：LibriSpeech。这个用于自动语音识别的语料库是从LibriVox项目中读取的有声读物派生而来的，并且经过仔细分段和对齐。在收集LibriSpeech英文音频书对应的法语电子书后，我们将句级的语音段与各自的翻译对齐，获得236h的可用并行数据。本文介绍了处理的细节以及对语料库的一小部分进行的手动评估。这个评估表明，自动对齐得分与双语对齐质量的人类判断是合理相关的。我们相信，这个语料库（在线提供）对于直接语言翻译或更一般的口语翻译实验中的可复制实验是有用的。
