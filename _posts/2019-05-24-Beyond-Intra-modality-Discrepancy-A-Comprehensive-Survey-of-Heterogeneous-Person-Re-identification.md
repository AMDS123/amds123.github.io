##### Abstract
An effective and efficient person re-identification (ReID) algorithm will alleviate painful video watching, and accelerate the investigation progress. Recently, with the explosive requirements of practical applications, a lot of research efforts have been dedicated to heterogeneous person re-identification (He-ReID). In this paper, we review the state-of-the-art methods comprehensively with respect to four main application scenarios -- low-resolution, infrared, sketch and text. We begin with a comparison between He-ReID and the general Homogeneous ReID (Ho-ReID) task. Then, we survey the models that have been widely employed in He-ReID. Available existing datasets for performing evaluation are briefly described. We then summarize and compare the representative approaches. Finally, we discuss some future research directions.
