##### Abstract
Fashion is a perpetual topic in human social life, and the mass has the penchant to emulate what large city residents and celebrities wear. Undeniably, New York City is such a bellwether large city with all kinds of fashion leadership. Consequently, to study what the fashion trends are during this year, it is very helpful to learn the fashion trends of New York City. Discovering fashion trends in New York City could boost many applications such as clothing recommendation and advertising. Does the fashion trend in the New York Fashion Show actually influence the clothing styles on the public? To answer this question, we design a novel system that consists of three major components: (1) constructing a large dataset from the New York Fashion Shows and New York street chic in order to understand the likely clothing fashion trends in New York, (2) utilizing a learning-based approach to discover fashion attributes as the representative characteristics of fashion trends, and (3) comparing the analysis results from the New York Fashion Shows and street-chic images to verify whether the fashion shows have actual influence on the people in New York City. Through the preliminary experiments over a large clothing dataset, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed system, and obtain useful insights on fashion trends and fashion influence.

时尚在人类社会生活中是一个永恒的话题，群众有模仿大城市居民和名流穿戴的倾向。不可否认，纽约市是这样一个风头正劲的大城市，拥有各种时尚领导力。因此，为了研究今年的流行趋势，了解纽约市的流行趋势非常有帮助。发现纽约市的时尚潮流可以推动许多应用，如服装推荐和广告。纽约时装秀的流行趋势实际上是否影响了公众的服装风格？为了回答这个问题，我们设计了一个新颖的系统，它由三个主要部分组成：（1）从纽约时装表演和纽约街头时尚中构建一个大型数据集，以便了解纽约可能的服装流行趋势; ）利用以学习为基础的方法来发现时尚属性作为时尚潮流的代表性特征;（3）比较纽约时装表演和街头时尚形象的分析结果，以验证时装表演是否对人们有实际影响在纽约市。通过对大型服装数据集的初步实验，证明了我们提出的系统的有效性，并获得了有关时尚趋势和时尚影响的有用见解。
