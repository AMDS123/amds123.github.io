##### Abstract
Wearable cameras can gather large a\-mounts of image data that provide rich visual information about the daily activities of the wearer. Motivated by the large number of health applications that could be enabled by the automatic recognition of daily activities, such as lifestyle characterization for habit improvement, context-aware personal assistance and tele-rehabilitation services, we propose a system to classify 21 daily activities from photo-streams acquired by a wearable photo-camera. Our approach combines the advantages of a Late Fusion Ensemble strategy relying on convolutional neural networks at image level with the ability of recurrent neural networks to account for the temporal evolution of high level features in photo-streams without relying on event boundaries. The proposed batch-based approach achieved an overall accuracy of 89.85\%, outperforming state of the art end-to-end methodologies. These results were achieved on a dataset consists of 44,902 egocentric pictures from three persons captured during 26 days in average.

可穿戴相机可以收集大量的图像数据，为佩戴者的日常活动提供丰富的视觉信息。受到自动识别日常活动（如习惯改善的生活方式特征描述，情境感知个人帮助和远程康复服务）可实现的大量健康应用的启发，我们提出了一个系统，可根据照片对21种日常活动进行分类通过可穿戴照相机获取的流媒体。我们的方法结合了基于卷积神经网络的图像层级的晚期融合集成策略的优势，以及循环神经网络能够解释光流中高级特征的时间演变而不依赖于事件边界的能力。建议的基于批次的方法实现了89.85％的总体准确度，超越了现有技术的端到端方法。这些结果是在一个数据集上实现的，该数据集包含平均26天内捕获的三个人的44,902个自我中心照片。
