##### Abstract
This technical report describes the multi-label classification (MLC) search space in the MEKA software, including the traditional/meta MLC algorithms, and the traditional/meta/pre-processing single-label classification (SLC) algorithms. The SLC search space is also studied because is part of MLC search space as several methods use problem transformation methods to create a solution (i.e., a classifier) for a MLC problem. This was done in order to understand better the MLC algorithms. Finally, we propose a grammar that formally expresses this understatement.
