##### Abstract
This work presents a neural network that consists of nodes with heterogeneous sensitivity. Each node in a network is assigned a variable that determines the sensitivity with which it learns to perform a given task. The network is trained by a constrained optimization that minimizes the sparsity of the sensitivity variables while ensuring the network's performance. As a result, the network learns to perform a given task using only a small number of sensitive nodes. The L-curve is used to find a regularization parameter for the constrained optimization. To validate our approach, we design networks with optimal architectures for autoregression, object recognition, facial expression recognition, and object detection. In our experiments, the optimal networks designed by the proposed method provide the same or higher performance but with far less computational complexity.
