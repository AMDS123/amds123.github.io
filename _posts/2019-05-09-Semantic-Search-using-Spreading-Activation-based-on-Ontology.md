##### Abstract
Currently, the text document retrieval systems have many challenges in exploring the semantics of queries and documents. Each query implies information which does not appear in the query but the documents related with the information are also expected by user. The disadvantage of the previous spreading activation algorithms could be many irrelevant concepts added to the query. In this paper, a proposed novel algorithm is only activate and add to the query named entities which are related with original entities in the query and explicit relations in the query.
