##### Abstract
Classification is a fundamental task in machine learning and data mining. Existing classification methods are designed to classify unknown instances within a set of previously known training classes. Such a classification takes the form of a prediction within a closed-set of classes. However, a more realistic scenario that fits real-world applications is to consider the possibility of encountering instances that do not belong to any of the training classes, $i.e.$, an open-set classification. In such situation, existing closed-set classifiers will assign a training label to these instances resulting in a misclassification. In this paper, we introduce Galaxy-X, a novel multi-class classification approach for open-set recognition problems. For each class of the training set, Galaxy-X creates a minimum bounding hyper-sphere that encompasses the distribution of the class by enclosing all of its instances. In such manner, our method is able to distinguish instances resembling previously seen classes from those that are of unknown ones. To adequately evaluate open-set classification, we introduce a novel evaluation procedure. Experimental results on benchmark datasets show the efficiency of our approach in classifying novel instances from known as well as unknown classes.

分类是机器学习和数据挖掘的基本任务。现有的分类方法被设计用来对一组以前已知的训练课程中的未知实例进行分类。这种分类采用封闭的类别内的预测形式。然而，更符合实际应用的更现实的场景是考虑遇到不属于任何训练类别的实例（即$，即开放分类）的可能性。在这种情况下，现有的封闭式分类器将为这些实例分配一个训练标签，导致错误分类。在本文中，我们介绍Galaxy-X，一种用于开放式识别问题的新型多类分类方法。对于训练集的每一类，Galaxy-X创建一个最小边界超球体，通过包含所有实例来包含类的分布。以这种方式，我们的方法能够区分以前看过的类和那些未知类的实例。为了充分评估开放分类，我们引入了新的评估程序。基准数据集上的实验结果显示了我们的方法在从已知类和未知类中分类新实例的效率。
