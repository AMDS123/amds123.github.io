##### Abstract
The ungrammatical sentence "The key to the cabinets are on the table" is known to lead to an illusion of grammaticality. As discussed in the meta-analysis by Jaeger et al., 2017, faster reading times are observed at the verb are in the agreement-attraction sentence above compared to the equally ungrammatical sentence "The key to the cabinet are on the table". One explanation for this facilitation effect is the feature percolation account: the plural feature on cabinets percolates up to the head noun key, leading to the illusion. An alternative account is in terms of cue-based retrieval (Lewis & Vasishth, 2005), which assumes that the non-subject noun cabinets is misretrieved due to a partial feature-match when a dependency completion process at the auxiliary initiates a memory access for a subject with plural marking. We present evidence for yet another explanation for the observed facilitation. Because the second sentence has two nouns with identical number, it is possible that these are, in some proportion of trials, more difficult to keep distinct, leading to slower reading times at the verb in the first sentence above; this is the feature overwriting account of Nairne, 1990. We show that the feature overwriting proposal can be implemented as a finite mixture process. We reanalysed ten published data-sets, fitting hierarchical Bayesian mixture models to these data assuming a two-mixture distribution. We show that in nine out of the ten studies, a mixture distribution corresponding to feature overwriting furnishes a superior fit over both the feature percolation and the cue-based retrieval accounts.

不合语法的句子“柜子的钥匙在桌子上”已知导致语法错觉。正如Jaeger等人在2017年的meta分析中所讨论的那样，与动词句子“柜子钥匙在桌子上”同样不合语法的句子相比，在动词上的动词读取速度更快。这种促进效应的一个解释是特征渗透计算：柜子上的复数特征渗透到头部名词键，导致错觉。一个替代账户是基于提示检索（刘易斯和Vasishth，2005年），假设非主题名词橱柜错误检索由于部分功能匹配当辅助依赖完成过程启动内存访问一个带有复数标记的主题。我们提供证据为观察便利化的另一种解释。因为第二句有两个相同数目的名词，所以这些可能在一定比例的审判中更难保持截然不同，导致上面第一句动词的阅读时间变慢;这是1990年Nairne的特征覆盖帐户。我们表明特征重写提议可以作为一个有限的混合过程来实现。我们重新分析了10个公布的数据集，假设有两个混合分布，将分层贝叶斯混合模型拟合到这些数据上。我们显示在十个研究中的九个中，对应于特征覆盖的混合分布提供了对特征渗透和基于提示的检索帐户的更好匹配。
