##### Abstract
Breaking news leads to situations of fast-paced reporting in social media, producing all kinds of updates related to news stories, albeit with the caveat that some of those early updates tend to be rumours, i.e., information with an unverified status at the time of posting. Flagging information that is unverified can be helpful to avoid the spread of information that may turn out to be false. Detection of rumours can also feed a rumour tracking system that ultimately determines their veracity. In this paper we introduce a novel approach to rumour detection that learns from the sequential dynamics of reporting during breaking news in social media to detect rumours in new stories. Using Twitter datasets collected during five breaking news stories, we experiment with Conditional Random Fields as a sequential classifier that leverages context learnt during an event for rumour detection, which we compare with the state-of-the-art rumour detection system as well as other baselines. In contrast to existing work, our classifier does not need to observe tweets querying a piece of information to deem it a rumour, but instead we detect rumours from the tweet alone by exploiting context learnt during the event. Our classifier achieves competitive performance, beating the state-of-the-art classifier that relies on querying tweets with improved precision and recall, as well as outperforming our best baseline with nearly 40% improvement in terms of F1 score. The scale and diversity of our experiments reinforces the generalisability of our classifier.

突发新闻导致社交媒体上的快速报道情况，产生与新闻报道有关的各种更新，尽管有些早期更新倾向于是谣言，即在未来的时间张贴。对未经验证的信息进行标记可能有助于避免信息的传播，这些信息可能是错误的。谣言的检测也可以提供一个谣言追踪系统，最终确定他们的真实性。在本文中，我们介绍一种新颖的谣言检测方法，通过在社交媒体中突发新闻报道的顺序动态学习来检测新闻中的谣言。使用在五个重大新闻故事中收集的Twitter数据集，我们试验了条件随机场作为一个顺序分类器，它利用在事件期间学习的上下文进行谣言检测，我们将其与最先进的谣言检测系统以及其他基线。与现有的工作相比，我们的分类器不需要观察微博来查询某条信息，从而将其视为一种谣言，而是通过利用在事件中获得的上下文来检测来自微博的传言。我们的分类器实现了有竞争力的表现，击败了最先进的分类器，它依靠查询更精确和回忆的推文，同时也超越了我们最好的基准，F1分数提高了近40％。我们的实验的规模和多样性加强了我们的分类器的普遍性。
