##### Abstract
We establish exact recovery for the Least Unsquared Deviations (LUD) algorithm of \"{O}zyesil and Singer. More precisely, we show that for sufficiently many cameras with given corrupted pairwise directions, where both camera locations and pairwise directions are generated by a special probabilistic model, the LUD algorithm exactly recovers the camera locations with high probability. A similar exact recovery guarantee was established for the ShapeFit algorithm by Hand, Lee and Voroninski, but with typically less corruption.

我们为{O} zyesil和Singer的Least Unsquared Deviations（LUD）算法建立了精确的恢复。更确切地说，我们证明了对于有足够多的相机给定损坏的成对方向，其中两个相机位置和成对的方向是由特殊的概率模型，LUD算法能够以较高的概率准确地恢复摄像机位置，Hand，Lee和Voroninski为ShapeFit算法建立了类似的精确恢复保证，但通常具有较少的损坏。
