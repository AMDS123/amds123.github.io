##### Abstract
Recent progress in neural learning demonstrated that machines can do well in regularized tasks, e.g., the game of Go. However, artistic activities such as poem generation are still widely regarded as human's special capability. In this paper, we demonstrate that a simple neural model can imitate human in some tasks of art generation. We particularly focus on traditional Chinese poetry, and show that machines can do as well as many contemporary poets and weakly pass the Feigenbaum Test, a variant of Turing test in professional domains. Our method is based on an attention-based recurrent neural network, which accepts a set of keywords as the theme and generates poems by looking at each keyword during the generation. A number of techniques are proposed to improve the model, including character vector initialization, attention to input and hybrid-style training. Compared to existing poetry generation methods, our model can generate much more theme-consistent and semantic-rich poems.

神经学习的最新进展表明，机器可以在规则化的任务中表现出色，例如Go的游戏。但是，诗歌创作等艺术活动依然被广泛认为是人类的特殊能力。在本文中，我们证明了一个简单的神经模型可以模仿人类在艺术生成的一些任务。我们特别关注中国传统的诗歌，表明机器可以和许多当代诗人一样，并弱化通过Feigenbaum测试，Feigenbaum测试，专业领域的图灵测试的变种。我们的方法是基于注意的循环神经网络，它接受一组关键字作为主题，并通过在生成过程中查看每个关键字来生成诗歌。提出了许多技术来改进模型，包括字符矢量初始化，注意力投入和混合式训练。与现有的诗歌创作方法相比，我们的模式可以产生更多的主题一致和语义丰富的诗歌。
