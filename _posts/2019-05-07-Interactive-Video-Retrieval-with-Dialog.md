##### Abstract
Now that everyone can easily record videos, the quantity of which is continuously increasing, research on methods for improved video retrieval is important in the contemporary world. In cases where target videos are to be identified within a large collection gathered by individuals, the appropriate information must be obtained to retrieve the correct video within a large number of similar items in the target database. The purpose of this research is to retrieve target videos in such cases by introducing an interaction, or a dialog, between the system and the user. We propose a system to retrieve videos by asking questions about the content of the videos and leveraging the user's responses to the questions. Additionally, we confirmed the usefulness of the proposed system through experiments using the dataset called AVSD which includes videos and dialogs about the videos.
