##### Abstract
In this paper, a linear mathematical model for a quad copter unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) is derived. The three degrees of freedom (3DOF) and six degrees of freedom (6DOF) quad copter state-space models are developed starting from basic Newtonian equations. These state space models are very important to control the quad copter system which is inherently dynamically unstable.
