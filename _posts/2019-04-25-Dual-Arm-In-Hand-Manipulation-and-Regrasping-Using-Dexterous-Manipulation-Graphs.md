##### Abstract
This work focuses on the problem of in-hand manipulation and regrasping of objects with parallel grippers. We propose Dexterous Manipulation Graph (DMG) as a representation on which we define planning for in-hand manipulation and regrasping. The DMG is a disconnected undirected graph that represents the possible motions of a finger along the object's surface. We formulate the in-hand manipulation and regrasping problem as a graph search problem from the initial to the final configuration. The resulting plan is a sequence of coordinated in-hand pushing and regrasping movements. We propose a dual-arm system for the execution of the sequence where both hands are used interchangeably. We demonstrate our approach on an ABB Yumi robot tasked with different grasp reconfigurations.
