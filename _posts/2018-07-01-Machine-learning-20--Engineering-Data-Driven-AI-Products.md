##### Abstract
ML 2.0: In this paper, we propose a paradigm shift from the current practice of creating machine learning models - which requires months-long discovery, exploration and "feasibility report" generation, followed by re-engineering for deployment - in favor of a rapid, 8-week process of development, understanding, validation and deployment that can executed by developers or subject matter experts (non-ML experts) using reusable APIs. This accomplishes what we call a "minimum viable data-driven model," delivering a ready-to-use machine learning model for problems that haven't been solved before using machine learning. We provide provisions for the refinement and adaptation of the "model," with strict enforcement and adherence to both the scaffolding/abstractions and the process. We imagine that this will bring forth the second phase in machine learning, in which discovery is subsumed by more targeted goals of delivery and impact.

ML 2.0：在本文中，我们提出了从创建机器学习模型的当前实践的范式转变 - 这需要长达数月的发现，探索和“可行性报告”生成，然后重新设计部署 - 有利于快速，8周的开发，理解，验证和部署过程，可由开发人员或主题专家（非ML专家）使用可重用API执行。这实现了我们所谓的“最小可行数据驱动模型”，为使用机器学习之前尚未解决的问题提供了即用型机器学习模型。我们提供了对“模型”的完善和调整的规定，严格执行并遵守脚手架/抽象和流程。我们想象这将带来机器学习的第二阶段，其中发现被更有针对性的交付和影响目标所包含。
