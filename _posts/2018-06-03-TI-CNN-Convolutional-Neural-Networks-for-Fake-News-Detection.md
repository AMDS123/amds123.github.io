##### Abstract
With the development of social networks, fake news for various commercial and political purposes has been appearing in large numbers and gotten widespread in the online world. With deceptive words, people can get infected by the fake news very easily and will share them without any fact-checking. For instance, during the 2016 US president election, various kinds of fake news about the candidates widely spread through both official news media and the online social networks. These fake news is usually released to either smear the opponents or support the candidate on their side. The erroneous information in the fake news is usually written to motivate the voters' irrational emotion and enthusiasm. Such kinds of fake news sometimes can bring about devastating effects, and an important goal in improving the credibility of online social networks is to identify the fake news timely. In this paper, we propose to study the fake news detection problem. Automatic fake news identification is extremely hard, since pure model based fact-checking for news is still an open problem, and few existing models can be applied to solve the problem. With a thorough investigation of a fake news data, lots of useful explicit features are identified from both the text words and images used in the fake news. Besides the explicit features, there also exist some hidden patterns in the words and images used in fake news, which can be captured with a set of latent features extracted via the multiple convolutional layers in our model. A model named as TI-CNN (Text and Image information based Convolutinal Neural Network) is proposed in this paper. By projecting the explicit and latent features into a unified feature space, TI-CNN is trained with both the text and image information simultaneously. Extensive experiments carried on the real-world fake news datasets have demonstrate the effectiveness of TI-CNN.

随着社交网络的发展，出于各种商业和政治目的的假消息已经大量出现并在网络世界中广泛流传。用欺骗性的话来说，人们很容易被假新闻感染，并会在没有任何事实核查的情况下分享它们。例如，在2016年美国总统大选期间，通过官方新闻媒体和在线社交网络广泛传播的候选人的各种假新闻。这些虚假新闻通常会发布，以诋毁对手或支持候选人。假新闻中的错误信息通常是为了激发选民的不合理情绪和激情。这类虚假新闻有时会带来破坏性影响，提高在线社交网络可信度的一个重要目标是及时发现虚假新闻。在本文中，我们建议研究假新闻检测问题。自动假新闻识别非常困难，因为基于纯模型的新闻事实检查仍然是一个公开问题，很少有现有的模型可以应用于解决问题。通过对假新闻数据的彻底调查，从虚假新闻中使用的文字和图像中识别出许多有用的明确特征。除了显式特征之外，假新闻中使用的单词和图像中还存在一些隐藏模式，这些隐藏模式可以通过我们模型中通过多个卷积层提取的一组潜在特征来捕获。本文提出了一种名为TI-CNN（基于文本和图像信息的卷积神经网络）的模型。通过将显式和潜在特征投影到一个统一的特征空间中，TI-CNN同时接受文本和图像信息的训练。对现实世界的假新闻数据集进行的大量实验已经证明了TI-CNN的有效性。
