##### Abstract
Computational aesthetics is an emerging field of research which has attracted different research groups in the last few years. In this field, one of the main approaches to evaluate the aesthetic quality of paintings and photographs is a feature-based approach. Among the different features proposed to reach this goal, color plays an import role. In this paper, we introduce a novel dataset that consists of paintings of Western provenance from 36 well-known painters from the 15th to the 20th century. As a first step and to assess this dataset, using a classifier, we investigate the correlation between the subjective scores and two widely used features that are related to color perception and in different aesthetic quality assessment approaches. Results show a classification rate of up to 73% between the color features and the subjective scores.

计算美学是近年来吸引了不同研究群体的新兴研究领域。在这个领域，评估绘画和照片的审美质量的主要方法之一是基于特征的方法。为了实现这个目标，色彩起着重要的作用。在本文中，我们介绍了一个由15世纪到20世纪的36位着名画家的西方绘画作品组成的新数据集。作为评估这个数据集的第一步，使用一个分类器，我们调查了主观评分和两个广泛使用的与色觉相关的特征和不同的美学质量评估方法之间的相关性。结果显示颜色特征和主观评分之间的分类率高达73％。
