##### Abstract
Feature extraction and matching are two crucial components in person Re-Identification (ReID). The large pose deformations and the complex view variations exhibited by the captured person images significantly increase the difficulty of learning and matching of the features from person images. To overcome these difficulties, in this work we propose a Pose-driven Deep Convolutional (PDC) model to learn improved feature extraction and matching models from end to end. Our deep architecture explicitly leverages the human part cues to alleviate the pose variations and learn robust feature representations from both the global image and different local parts. To match the features from global human body and local body parts, a pose driven feature weighting sub-network is further designed to learn adaptive feature fusions. Extensive experimental analyses and results on three popular datasets demonstrate significant performance improvements of our model over all published state-of-the-art methods.

特征提取和匹配是人重新识别（ReID）中的两个关键组件。被拍摄人物图像展现的大姿态变形和复杂视图变化显着增加了人物图像的特征学习和匹配的难度。为了克服这些困难，本文提出了一种基于姿态驱动的深度卷积（PDC）模型来学习改进的特征提取和匹配模型。我们的深层结构明确地利用人体部分线索来缓解姿态变化，并从全局图像和不同的局部部分学习鲁棒的特征表示。为了匹配来自全球人体和局部身体部位的特征，进一步设计姿态驱动特征加权子网络以学习自适应特征融合。在三个流行的数据集上的广泛的实验分析和结果证明了我们的模型在所有已发表的最先进的方法上都有显着的性能改进。
