##### Abstract
Haze removal has been a very challenging problem due to its ill-posedness, which is more ill-posed if the input data is only a single hazy image. In this paper, we present a new approach for removing haze from a single input image. The proposed method combines the model widely used to describe the formation of a haze image with the assumption in Retinex that an image is the product of the illumination and the reflection. We assume that the depth and reflection functions are spatially piecewise smooth in the model, where the total variation is used for the regularization. The proposed model is defined as a constrained optimization problem, which is solved by an alternating minimization scheme and the fast gradient projection algorithm. Some theoretic analyses are given for the proposed model and algorithm. Finally, numerical examples are presented to demonstrate that our method can restore vivid and contrastive hazy images effectively.

如果输入的数据只是一个模糊的图像，则去除阴霾是一个非常具有挑战性的问题，因为它的病态性较差。在本文中，我们提出了一种从单个输入图像中去除雾霾的新方法。所提出的方法将广泛用于描述雾影图像形成的模型与Retinex中的假设相结合，即图像是照明和反射的产物。我们假设模型中的深度和反射函数在空间上是分段平滑的，其中整体变化被用于正则化。所提出的模型被定义为约束优化问题，其通过交替最小化方案和快速梯度投影算法来解决。给出了该模型和算法的理论分析。最后通过数值例子说明了该方法能够有效地恢复生动，对比的模糊图像。
