##### Abstract
Labeling each instance in a large dataset is extremely labor- and time- consuming . One way to alleviate this problem is active learning, which aims to which discover the most valuable instances for labeling to construct a powerful classifier. Considering both informativeness and representativeness provides a promising way to design a practical active learning. However, most existing active learning methods select instances favoring either informativeness or representativeness. Meanwhile, many are designed based on the binary class, so that they may present suboptimal solutions on the datasets with multiple classes. In this paper, a hybrid informative and representative criterion based multi-class active learning approach is proposed. We combine the informative informativeness and representativeness into one formula, which can be solved under a unified framework. The informativeness is measured by the margin minimum while the representative information is measured by the maximum mean discrepancy. By minimizing the upper bound for the true risk, we generalize the empirical risk minimization principle to the active learning setting. Simultaneously, our proposed method makes full use of the label information, and the proposed active learning is designed based on multiple classes. So the proposed method is not suitable to the binary class but also the multiple classes. We conduct our experiments on twelve benchmark UCI data sets, and the experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method performs better than some state-of-the-art methods.

在大数据集中标记每个实例非常费时费力。减轻这个问题的一种方法是主动学习，其目的是发现标记的最有价值的实例来构建强大的分类器。考虑到信息性和代表性提供了一个有前途的方法来设计一个实用的主动学习。然而，大多数现有的主动学习方法选择有利于信息性或代表性的实例。同时，很多都是基于二元类设计的，因此它们可能会在具有多个类的数据集上呈现次优解。本文提出了一种基于混合信息和代表性标准的多类主动学习方法。我们把信息性和代表性融合到一个公式中，可以在统一的框架下解决。信息量由边际最小值来衡量，而代表性信息则通过最大平均差异来衡量。通过最小化真正风险的上限，我们将经验风险最小化原则推广到主动学习环境。同时，我们提出的方法充分利用了标签信息，并且提出了基于多个类别的主动学习。所以该方法不适用于二进制类，也适用于多个类。我们在12个基准UCI数据集上进行了实验，实验结果表明，所提出的方法比一些最先进的方法表现更好。
