##### Abstract
How much does a single image reveal about the environment it was taken in? In this paper, we investigate how much of that information can be retrieved from a foreground object, combined with the background (i.e. the visible part of the environment). Assuming it is not perfectly diffuse, the foreground object acts as a complexly shaped and far-from-perfect mirror. An additional challenge is that its appearance confounds the light coming from the environment with the unknown materials it is made of. We propose a learning-based approach to predict the environment from multiple reflectance maps that are computed from approximate surface normals. The proposed method allows us to jointly model the statistics of environments and material properties. We train our system from synthesized training data, but demonstrate its applicability to real-world data. Interestingly, our analysis shows that the information obtained from objects made out of multiple materials often is complementary and leads to better performance.

一幅图像揭示了这个环境是多少？在本文中，我们调查了可以从前景对象中检索多少信息，并结合背景（即环境的可见部分）。假设它不是完美的漫反射，前景物体就像一个复杂的形状和远离完美的镜子。另外一个挑战是它的外观混淆了来自环境的光线和它所制造的未知材料。我们提出了一种基于学习的方法来预测从近似表面法线计算出来的多个反射率图的环境。所提出的方法使我们能够共同模拟环境和材料属性的统计。我们从综合训练数据训练我们的系统，但是证明它适用于真实世界的数据。有趣的是，我们的分析表明，从多种材料制成的物体获得的信息通常是互补的，并且导致更好的性能。
