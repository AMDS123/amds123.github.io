##### Abstract
In the present paper we describe the technology for translating algorithmic descriptions of discrete functions to SAT. The proposed technology is aimed at applications in algebraic cryptanalysis. We describe how cryptanalysis instances are reduced to SAT in such a way that it should be perceived as natural by the cryptographic community. Therefore, in the theoretical part of the paper we justify the main principles of general reduction to SAT for discrete functions from a class containing the majority of functions employed in cryptography. Based on these principles we describe the Transalg software system, developed with SAT-based cryptanalysis specifics in mind. We show the results of applications of Transalg to construction of a number of attacks on various cryptographic functions. Some of the corresponding attacks are state of the art. We also compare the functional capabilities of the proposed system with that of other software systems that can be used to reduce cryptanalysis instances to SAT, and also with the CBMC system widely employed in symbolic verification. In the paper we also present vast experimental data, obtained using the SAT-solvers that took first places at the SAT-competitions in the recent several years.
