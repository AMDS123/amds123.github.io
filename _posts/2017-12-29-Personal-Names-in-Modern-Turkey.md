##### Abstract
We analyzed the most common 5000 male and 5000 female Turkish names based on their etymological, morphological, and semantic attributes. The name statistics are based on all Turkish citizens who were alive in 2014 and they cover 90% of all population. To the best of our knowledge, this study is the most comprehensive data-driven analysis of Turkish personal names. Female names have a greater diversity than male names (e.g., top 15 male names cover 25% of the male population, whereas top 28 female names cover 25% of the female population). Despite their diversity, female names exhibit predictable patterns. For example, certain roots such as g\"ul and nar (rose and pomegranate/red, respectively) are used to generate hundreds of unique female names. Turkish personal names have their origins mainly in Arabic, followed by Turkish and Persian. We computed overall frequencies of names according to broad semantic themes that were identified in previous studies. We found that foreign-origin names such as olga and khaled, pastoral names such as ya\u{g}mur and deniz (rain and sea, respectively), and names based on fruits and plants such as filiz and menek\c{s}e (sprout and violet, respectively) are more frequently observed among females. Among males, names based on animals such as arslan and yunus (lion and dolphin, respectively) and names based on famous and/or historical figures such as mustafa kemal and o\u{g}uz ka\u{g}an (founder of the Turkish Republic and the founder of the Turks in Turkish mythology, respectively) are observed more frequently.

我们根据词源，形态和语义属性分析了最常见的5000名男性和5000名女性土耳其人的名字。这个名字的统计数据是基于2014年所有在世的土耳其公民，他们覆盖了全部人口的90％。据我们所知，这项研究是对土耳其人姓名的最全面的数据驱动分析。女性的名字比男性的名字更具多样性（例如，前15名男性的姓名覆盖男性人口的25％，而前28名女性的姓名覆盖25％的女性人口）。尽管多样性，女性名字展现出可预见的模式。例如，某些根源（例如分别是玫瑰和石榴/红色）被用来生成数百个独特的女性名字，土耳其人的姓名主要来源于阿拉伯语，其次是土耳其语和波斯语。我们发现，诸如olga和khaled等外国名字，分别是ya \ u {g} mur和deniz（分别为rain和sea）的田园名称，在女性中更频繁地观察到基于水果和植物的名称，例如filiz和menek（分别是发芽和紫罗兰），在雄性中，分别以阿尔斯兰和yunus（狮子和海豚）和基于着名和/或历史人物的姓名，如mustafa kemal和o ug g uz uz ka u（土耳其共和国的创始人和土耳其神话中的土耳其人的创始人）更频繁。
