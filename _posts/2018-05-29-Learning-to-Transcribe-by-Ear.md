##### Abstract
Rethinking how to model polyphonic transcription formally, we frame it as a reinforcement learning task. Such a task formulation encompasses the notion of a musical agent and an environment containing an instrument as well as the sound source to be transcribed. Within this conceptual framework, the transcription process can be described as the agent interacting with the instrument in the environment, and obtaining reward by playing along with what it hears. Choosing from a discrete set of actions - the notes to play on its instrument - the amount of reward the agent experiences depends on which notes it plays and when. This process resembles how a human musician might approach the task of transcription, and the satisfaction she achieves by closely mimicking the sound source to transcribe on her instrument. Following a discussion of the theoretical framework and the benefits of modelling the problem in this way, we focus our attention on several practical considerations and address the difficulties in training an agent to acceptable performance on a set of tasks with increasing difficulty. We demonstrate promising results in partially constrained environments.

重新思考如何正式模拟复音转录，我们将其作为强化学习任务。这样的任务表述涵盖了音乐代理人和包含乐器的环境以及要被转录的声源的概念。在这个概念框架内，转录过程可以被描述为与环境中的乐器相互作用的代理，并通过与听到的一起玩耍来获得奖励。从一组离散的行动中选择 - 在乐器上演奏的音符 - 演员代理的奖励数量取决于演奏的音符和时间。这个过程类似于一个人类音乐家如何处理转录任务，以及她通过模仿音源来转录她的乐器而获得的满足感。在讨论了理论框架和以这种方式对问题进行建模的好处之后，我们将注意力集中在几个实际考虑因素上，并且解决了在一组任务中训练一个代理人以接受性能越来越困难的困难。我们在部分受限的环境中展现出有希望的结果
