##### Abstract
We address the problem of detecting duplicate questions in forums, which is an important step towards automating the process of answering new questions. As finding and annotating such potential duplicates manually is very tedious and costly, automatic methods based on machine learning are a viable alternative. However, many forums do not have annotated data, i.e., questions labeled by experts as duplicates, and thus a promising solution is to use domain adaptation from another forum that has such annotations. Here we focus on adversarial domain adaptation, deriving important findings about when it performs well and what properties of the domains are important in this regard. Our experiments with StackExchange data show an average improvement of 5.6% over the best baseline across multiple pairs of domains.

我们解决了在论坛中检测重复问题的问题，这是自动化回答新问题的过程中的重要一步。由于手动查找和注释这些潜在的重复是非常繁琐和昂贵的，基于机器学习的自动方法是可行的替代方案。然而，许多论坛没有注释数据，即由专家标记为重复的问题，因此有希望的解决方案是使用来自具有这种注释的另一个论坛的域适应。在这里，我们关注对抗性领域的适应性，得出关于何时表现良好以及领域的哪些属性在这方面很重要的重要发现。我们使用StackExchange数据的实验显示，跨多对域的最佳基线平均提高了5.6％。
