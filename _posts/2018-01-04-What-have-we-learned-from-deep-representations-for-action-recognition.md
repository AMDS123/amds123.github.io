##### Abstract
As the success of deep models has led to their deployment in all areas of computer vision, it is increasingly important to understand how these representations work and what they are capturing. In this paper, we shed light on deep spatiotemporal representations by visualizing what two-stream models have learned in order to recognize actions in video. We show that local detectors for appearance and motion objects arise to form distributed representations for recognizing human actions. Key observations include the following. First, cross-stream fusion enables the learning of true spatiotemporal features rather than simply separate appearance and motion features. Second, the networks can learn local representations that are highly class specific, but also generic representations that can serve a range of classes. Third, throughout the hierarchy of the network, features become more abstract and show increasing invariance to aspects of the data that are unimportant to desired distinctions (e.g. motion patterns across various speeds). Fourth, visualizations can be used not only to shed light on learned representations, but also to reveal idiosyncracies of training data and to explain failure cases of the system.

随着深度模型的成功导致其在计算机视觉的所有领域的部署，了解这些表示的工作方式和捕获的内容变得越来越重要。在本文中，我们通过可视化两个视频流模型学习的视频来揭示深度时空表征。我们表明局部探测器的外观和运动对象出现形成分布式表示识别人类的行为。主要观察内容如下。首先，交叉流融合使得学习真正的时空特征，而不是简单地分开外观和运动特征。其次，网络可以学习高度特定于类的局部表示，而且可以学习可以服务于一系列类的泛型表示。第三，在整个网络层次结构中，特征变得更加抽象，并且对于对所期望的区别（例如，不同速度的运动模式）不重要的数据方面显示出不断增加的不变性。第四，可视化不仅可以用来阐明学习表示，还可以揭示训练数据的特质，并解释系统的失败情况。
