##### Abstract
Of basic interest is the quantification of the long term growth of a language's lexicon as it develops to more completely cover both a culture's communication requirements and knowledge space. Here, we explore the usage dynamics of words in the English language as reflected by the Google Books 2012 English Fiction corpus. We critique an earlier method that found decreasing birth and increasing death rates of words over the second half of the 20th Century, showing death rates to be strongly affected by the imposed time cutoff of the arbitrary present and not increasing dramatically. We provide a robust, principled approach to examining lexical evolution by tracking the volume of word flux across various relative frequency thresholds. We show that while the overall statistical structure of the English language remains stable over time in terms of its raw Zipf distribution, we find evidence of an enduring `lexical turbulence': The flux of words across frequency thresholds from decade to decade scales superlinearly with word rank and exhibits a scaling break we connect to that of Zipf's law. To better understand the changing lexicon, we examine the contributions to the Jensen-Shannon divergence of individual words crossing frequency thresholds. We also find indications that scholarly works about fiction are strongly represented in the 2012 English Fiction corpus, and suggest that a future revision of the corpus should attempt to separate critical works from fiction itself.

基本兴趣是量化语言词汇的长期增长，因为它发展为更全面地涵盖文化的沟通需求和知识空间。在这里，我们将探索Google图书2012英文小说语料库反映的英文单词的使用动态。我们对20世纪下半叶出生率下降和死亡率上升的早期方法进行了批评，表明死亡率受强制时间截止时间的强烈影响，而不是剧增。我们提供了一个强大的，有原则的方法，通过跟踪各种相对频率阈值的字流量来检查词汇进化。我们发现尽管英语语言的整体统计结构在原始的Zipf分布方面随时间保持稳定，但是我们发现了一个持久的“词汇动荡”的证据：跨越频率阈值从十年到十年的词汇流量与词汇超线性排名和展示一个缩放突破我们连接到齐夫定律。为了更好地理解不断变化的词典，我们考察了单词跨越频率阈值的Jensen-Shannon散度的贡献。我们还发现有迹象表明，2012年英文小说语料库中有很强的代表性的小说学术着作，并且认为将来对语料库的修订应该试图将批评作品与小说本身分开。
