##### Abstract
In this paper, we propose a deep generative adversarial network for super-resolution considering the trade-off between perception and distortion. Based on good performance of a recently developed model for super-resolution, i.e., deep residual network using enhanced upscale modules (EUSR), the proposed model is trained to improve perceptual performance with only slight increase of distortion. For this purpose, together with the conventional content loss, i.e., reconstruction loss such as L1 or L2, we consider additional losses in the training phase, which are the discrete cosine transform coefficients loss and differential content loss. These consider perceptual part in the content loss, i.e., consideration of proper high frequency components is helpful for the trade-off problem in super-resolution. The experimental results show that our proposed model has good performance for both perception and distortion, and is effective in perceptual super-resolution applications.

在本文中，我们提出了一种用于超分辨率的深度生成对抗网络，考虑到感知和失真之间的权衡。基于最近开发的用于超分辨率的模型（即，使用增强的高级模块（EUSR）的深度残余网络）的良好性能，所训练的模型被训练为仅通过略微增加的失真来改善感知性能。为此目的，与传统的内容丢失，即诸如L1或L2的重建损失一起，我们考虑训练阶段中的附加损耗，其是离散余弦变换系数损失和差分内容丢失。这些考虑了内容丢失中的感知部分，即考虑适当的高频分量有助于超分辨率中的权衡问题。实验结果表明，我们提出的模型具有良好的感知和失真性能，在感知超分辨率应用中是有效的。
