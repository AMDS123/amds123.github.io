##### Abstract
Extracting accurate attribute qualities from product titles is a vital component in delivering eCommerce customers with a rewarding online shopping experience via an enriched faceted search. We demonstrate the potential of Deep Recurrent Networks in this domain, primarily models such as Bidirectional LSTMs and Bidirectional LSTM-CRF with or without an attention mechanism. These have improved overall F1 scores, as compared to the previous benchmarks (More et al.) by at least 0.0391, showcasing an overall precision of 97.94%, recall of 94.12% and the F1 score of 0.9599. This has made us achieve a significant coverage of important facets or attributes of products which not only shows the efficacy of deep recurrent models over previous machine learning benchmarks but also greatly enhances the overall customer experience while shopping online.

从产品标题中提取准确的属性质量是通过丰富的分面搜索为电子商务客户提供有益的在线购物体验的重要组成部分。我们展示了深度递归网络在该领域的潜力，主要是双向LSTM和双向LSTM-CRF等模型，有或没有注意机制。与之前的基准测试（More等人）相比，这些评分提高了整体F1分数至少0.0391，显示总体精确度为97.94％，召回率为94.12％，F1评分为0.9599。这使我们对产品的重要方面或属性进行了重要报道，这不仅展示了深度复现模型相对于以前的机器学习基准的功效，而且极大地增强了在线购物时的整体客户体验。
