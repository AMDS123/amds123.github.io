##### Abstract
Extracting accurate attribute qualities from product titles is a vital component in delivering eCommerce customers with a rewarding online shopping experience via an enriched faceted search. We demonstrate the potential of Deep Recurrent Networks in this domain, primarily models such as Bidirectional LSTMs and Bidirectional LSTM-CRF with or without an attention mechanism. These have improved overall F1 scores, as compared to the previous benchmarks (More et al.) by at least 0.0391, showcasing an overall precision of 97.94%, recall of 94.12% and the F1 score of 0.9599. This has made us achieve a significant coverage of important facets or attributes of products which not only shows the efficacy of deep recurrent models over previous machine learning benchmarks but also greatly enhances the overall customer experience while shopping online.

从产品标题中提取准确的属性质量是通过丰富的分面搜索为电子商务客户提供有益的在线购物体验的重要组成部分。我们展示了深度复发网络在这一领域的潜力，主要是模型，如双向LSTM和双向LSTM-CRF，有或没有关注机制。与之前的基准（More等）相比，这些总分F1得分提高了至少0.0391，总体精确度为97.94％，回忆率为94.12％，F1得分为0.9599。这使我们获得了重要的产品重要方面或属性的覆盖面，不仅显示了经常性机器学习基准测试的深度复发模型的功效，而且大大增强了在线购物时的总体客户体验。
