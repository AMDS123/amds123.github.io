##### Abstract
Predictive business process monitoring methods exploit historical process execution logs to generate predictions about running instances of a process, including predictions of the remaining cycle time of running cases of a process. A number of approaches to tackle this latter prediction problem have been proposed in the literature. However, due to differences in the experimental setups, choice of datasets, evaluation measures and baselines, the relative performance of various methods remains unclear. This article presents a systematic review and taxonomy of methods for remaining time prediction in the context of business processes, as well as a cross-benchmark comparison of 16 methods based on 16 real-life datasets.

预测性业务流程监控方法利用历史流程执行日志来生成有关流程运行实例的预测，包括预测流程案例的剩余周期时间。文献中已经提出了许多解决后一种预测问题的方法。然而，由于实验设置，数据集的选择，评估措施和基线的差异，各种方法的相对表现仍不清楚。本文介绍了业务流程环境下剩余时间预测方法的系统评价和分类方法，以及基于16个实际数据集的16种方法的交叉基准比较。
