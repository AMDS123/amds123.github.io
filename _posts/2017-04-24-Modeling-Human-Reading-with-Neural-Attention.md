##### Abstract
When humans read text, they fixate some words and skip others. However, there have been few attempts to explain skipping behavior with computational models, as most existing work has focused on predicting reading times (e.g.,~using surprisal). In this paper, we propose a novel approach that models both skipping and reading, using an unsupervised architecture that combines a neural attention with autoencoding, trained on raw text using reinforcement learning. Our model explains human reading behavior as a tradeoff between precision of language understanding (encoding the input accurately) and economy of attention (fixating as few words as possible). We evaluate the model on the Dundee eye-tracking corpus, showing that it accurately predicts skipping behavior and reading times, is competitive with surprisal, and captures known qualitative features of human reading.

当人类阅读文本时，他们会固定一些单词并跳过其他单词。然而，很少有尝试用计算模型来解释跳跃行为，因为大多数现有的工作集中于预测阅读时间（例如〜使用惊人的）。在本文中，我们提出了一种新颖的方法，即跳过和阅读模型，使用无监督架构，结合了神经关注与自动编码，使用强化学习训练原始文本。我们的模型将人类阅读行为解释为语言理解的准确性（准确地对输入进行编码）和注意力的经济性之间的权衡（尽可能少地固定）。我们评估邓迪眼动跟踪语料库的模型，显示它准确地预测跳跃行为和阅读时间，具有惊人的竞争力，并捕捉人类阅读的已知定性特征。
