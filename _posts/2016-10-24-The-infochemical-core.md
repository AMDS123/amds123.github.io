##### Abstract
Vocalizations and less often gestures have been the object of linguistic research over decades. However, the development of a general theory of communication with human language as a particular case requires a clear understanding of the organization of communication through other means. Infochemicals are chemical compounds that carry information and are employed by small organisms that cannot emit acoustic signals of optimal frequency to achieve successful communication. Here the distribution of infochemicals across species is investigated when they are ranked by their degree or the number of species with which it is associated (because they produce or they are sensitive to it). The quality of the fit of different functions to the dependency between degree and rank is evaluated with a penalty for the number of parameters of the function. Surprisingly, a double Zipf (a Zipf distribution with two regimes with a different exponent each) is the model yielding the best fit although it is the function with the largest number of parameters. This suggests that the world wide repertoire of infochemicals contains a chemical nucleus shared by many species and reminiscent of the core vocabularies found for human language in dictionaries or large corpora.

几十年来，发声和少手势一直是语言学研究的对象。但是，作为一个特定的情况，发展一种与人类语言交流的一般理论，需要通过其他手段对交流的组织有一个清晰的认识。信息化学物质是携带信息的化学化合物，被小的有机体使用，不能发出最佳频率的声音信号来实现成功的交流。在这里，信息化学物质在物种间的分布是根据它们的程度或物种的数量（因为它们产生或者它们对它敏感）而被调查的。对函数参数个数的惩罚评估不同函数对度和等级之间依赖关系的拟合质量。令人惊讶的是，Zipf（Zipf分布，两种不同指数的分布）是最合适的模型，虽然它是具有最多参数的函数。这表明世界范围内的信息化学成分含有许多物种共有的化学核，让人联想到词典或大型语料库中人类语言的核心词汇。
