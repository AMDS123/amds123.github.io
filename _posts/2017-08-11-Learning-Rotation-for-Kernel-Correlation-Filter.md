##### Abstract
Kernel Correlation Filters have shown a very promising scheme for visual tracking in terms of speed and accuracy on several benchmarks. However it suffers from problems that affect its performance like occlusion, rotation and scale change. This paper tries to tackle the problem of rotation by reformulating the optimization problem for learning the correlation filter. This modification (RKCF) includes learning rotation filter that utilizes circulant structure of HOG feature to guesstimate rotation from one frame to another and enhance the detection of KCF. Hence it gains boost in overall accuracy in many of OBT50 detest videos with minimal additional computation.

内核相关滤波器在几个基准测试中显示了一个非常有前途的视频跟踪方案，在速度和准确性方面。但是，它会遇到影响其性能的问题，如遮挡，旋转和缩放变化。本文试图通过重新构造学习相关滤波器的优化问题来解决旋转问题。这种修改（RKCF）包括学习旋转滤波器，利用HOG特征的循环结构来推测从一帧到另一帧的旋转，并增强KCF的检测。因此，它在许多OBT50厌恶的视频中以最少的附加计算提高了整体的准确性。
