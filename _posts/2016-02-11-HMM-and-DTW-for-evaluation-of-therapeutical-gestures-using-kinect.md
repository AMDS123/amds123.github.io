##### Abstract
Automatic recognition of the quality of movement in human beings is a challenging task, given the difficulty both in defining the constraints that make a movement correct, and the difficulty in using noisy data to determine if these constraints were satisfied. This paper presents a method for the detection of deviations from the correct form in movements from physical therapy routines based on Hidden Markov Models, which is compared to Dynamic Time Warping. The activities studied include upper an lower limbs movements, the data used comes from a Kinect sensor. Correct repetitions of the activities of interest were recorded, as well as deviations from these correct forms. The ability of the proposed approach to detect these deviations was studied. Results show that a system based on HMM is much more likely to determine if a certain movement has deviated from the specification.

自动识别人体运动的质量是一个具有挑战性的任务，因为定义使运动正确的约束困难，以及难以使用噪声数据来确定这些约束是否满足。本文提出了一种基于隐马尔可夫模型的物理治疗例程中的偏离正确形式的方法，其与动态时间翘曲相比较。所研究的活动包括上肢和下肢运动，所使用的数据来自Kinect传感器。记录正确的重复活动记录，以及偏离这些正确的形式。研究了所提出的方法检测这些偏差的能力。结果显示，基于HMM的系统更有可能确定某个运动是否偏离了规范。
