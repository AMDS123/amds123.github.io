##### Abstract
Despite significant progress of deep learning in the field of computer vision, there has not been a software library that covers these methods in a unifying manner. We introduce ChainerCV, a software library that is intended to fill this gap. ChainerCV supports numerous neural network models as well as software components needed to conduct research in computer vision. These implementations emphasize simplicity, flexibility and good software engineering practices. The library is designed to perform on par with the results reported in published papers and its tools can be used as a baseline for future research in computer vision. Our implementation includes sophisticated models like Faster R-CNN and SSD, and covers tasks such as object detection and semantic segmentation.

尽管计算机视觉领域的深度学习取得了重大进展，但还没有一个统一涵盖这些方法的软件库。我们引入了ChainerCV，一个旨在填补这个空白的软件库。 ChainerCV支持许多神经网络模型以及进行计算机视觉研究所需的软件组件。这些实现强调简单性，灵活性和良好的软件工程实践。该图书馆的设计与发表的论文报告结果完全一致，其工具可作为未来计算机视觉研究的基准。我们的实现包括更快的R-CNN和SSD等复杂模型，并涵盖诸如对象检测和语义分割等任务。
