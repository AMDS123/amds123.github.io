##### Abstract
We propose a solution of the multiple target tracking (MTT) problem based on sets of trajectories and the random finite set framework. A full Bayesian approach to MTT should characterise the distribution of the trajectories given the measurements, as it contains all information about the trajectories. We attain this by considering multi-object density functions in which objects are trajectories. For the standard tracking models, we also describe a conjugate family of multitrajectory density functions.
