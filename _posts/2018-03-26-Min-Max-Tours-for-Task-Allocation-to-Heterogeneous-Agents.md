##### Abstract
We consider a scenario consisting of a set of heterogeneous mobile agents located at a depot, and a set of tasks dispersed over a geographic area. The agents are partitioned into different types. The tasks are partitioned into specialized tasks that can only be done by agents of a certain type, and generic tasks that can be done by any agent. The distances between each pair of tasks are specified, and satisfy the triangle inequality. Given this scenario, we address the problem of allocating these tasks among the available agents (subject to type compatibility constraints) while minimizing the maximum cost to tour the allocation by any agent and return to the depot. This problem is NP-hard, and we give a three phase algorithm to solve this problem that provides 5-factor approximation, regardless of the total number of agents and the number of agents of each type. We also show that in the special case where there is only one agent of each type, the algorithm has an approximation factor of 4.

我们考虑一个场景，该场景由位于仓库的一组异构移动代理和分散在一个地理区域上的一组任务组成。代理被分成不同的类型。这些任务被划分为只能由特定类型的代理完成的专用任务，以及可由任何代理完成的通用任务。指定每对任务之间的距离，并满足三角不等式。鉴于这种情况，我们解决了在可用代理之间分配这些任务的问题（受类型兼容性约束的限制），同时最大限度地降低任何代理巡视分配的最大成本并返回到软件仓库。这个问题是NP难题，我们给出了一个三阶段算法来解决这个问题，它提供了5因子近似，而不管代理的总数和每种类型的代理数量。我们还表明，在每种类型只有一个代理的特殊情况下，算法的近似因子为4。
