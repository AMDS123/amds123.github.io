##### Abstract
Aggregating extra features has been considered as an effective approach to boost traditional pedestrian detection methods. However, there is still a lack of studies on whether and how CNN-based pedestrian detectors can benefit from these extra features. The first contribution of this paper is exploring this issue by aggregating extra features into CNN-based pedestrian detection framework. Through extensive experiments, we evaluate the effects of different kinds of extra features quantitatively. Moreover, we propose a novel network architecture, namely HyperLearner, to jointly learn pedestrian detection as well as the given extra feature. By multi-task training, HyperLearner is able to utilize the information of given features and improve detection performance without extra inputs in inference. The experimental results on multiple pedestrian benchmarks validate the effectiveness of the proposed HyperLearner.

聚合额外的功能被认为是一种有效的方法来提高传统的行人检测方法。然而，仍然缺乏对基于CNN的行人探测器是否以及如何从这些额外特征中受益的研究。本文的第一个贡献是通过将额外的特征聚合到基于CNN的行人检测框架中来探索这个问题。通过广泛的实验，我们定量地评估了不同类型额外特征的影响。此外，我们提出了一个新的网络架构，即HyperLearner，联合学习行人检测以及给定的额外功能。通过多任务训练，HyperLearner能够利用给定特征的信息，提高检测性能，而不需要额外的推理输入。多个行人基准的实验结果验证了所提出的HyperLearner的有效性。
