##### Abstract
Identification of minimum number of local regions of a handwritten character image, containing well-defined discriminating features which are sufficient for a minimal but complete description of the character is a challenging task. A new region selection technique based on the idea of an enhanced Harmony Search methodology has been proposed here. The powerful framework of Harmony Search has been utilized to search the region space and detect only the most informative regions for correctly recognizing the handwritten character. The proposed method has been tested on handwritten samples of Bangla Basic, Compound and mixed (Basic and Compound characters) characters separately with SVM based classifier using a longest run based feature-set obtained from the image subregions formed by a CG based quad-tree partitioning approach. Applying this methodology on the above mentioned three types of datasets, respectively 43.75%, 12.5% and 37.5% gains have been achieved in terms of region reduction and 2.3%, 0.6% and 1.2% gains have been achieved in terms of recognition accuracy. The results show a sizeable reduction in the minimal number of descriptive regions as well a significant increase in recognition accuracy for all the datasets using the proposed technique. Thus the time and cost related to feature extraction is decreased without dampening the corresponding recognition accuracy.

识别手写字符图像的局部区域的最小数量，其中包含足以使字符最小但完整的描述的明确的区分特征是一项具有挑战性的任务。这里提出了基于增强型和声搜索方法的新的区域选择技术。和谐搜索的强大框架已经被用来搜索区域空间，并且仅仅检测用于正确识别手写字符的信息最多的区域。所提出的方法已经在基于SVM的分类器的Bangla Basic，Compound和Mixed（基本字符和复合字符）字符的手写样本上进行了测试，使用从基于CG的四叉树分割形成的图像子区域获得的基于最长运行的特征集做法。在上述三种数据集上应用这种方法，在区域减少方面分别取得了43.75％，12.5％和37.5％的收益，在识别准确性方面已经实现了2.3％，0.6％和1.2％的收益。结果显示描述性区域的最小数量的相当大的减少以及使用所提出的技术的所有数据集的识别精度的显着增加。因此减少了与特征提取相关的时间和成本，而不会降低相应的识别精度。
