##### Abstract
Word sense disambiguation helps identifying the proper sense of ambiguous words in text. With large terminologies such as the UMLS Metathesaurus ambiguities appear and highly effective disambiguation methods are required. Supervised learning algorithm methods are used as one of the approaches to perform disambiguation. Features extracted from the context of an ambiguous word are used to identify the proper sense of such a word. The type of features have an impact on machine learning methods, thus affect disambiguation performance. In this work, we have evaluated several types of features derived from the context of the ambiguous word and we have explored as well more global features derived from MEDLINE using word embeddings. Results show that word embeddings improve the performance of more traditional features and allow as well using recurrent neural network classifiers based on Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) nodes. The combination of unigrams and word embeddings with an SVM sets a new state of the art performance with a macro accuracy of 95.97 in the MSH WSD data set.

词义消歧有助于识别文本中歧义词的恰当含义。使用UMLS Metathesaurus含糊不清的大词汇，需要高度有效的消歧方法。监督学习算法方法被用作消除歧义的方法之一。从含糊不清的单词的上下文中提取的特征被用来识别这个单词的正确含义。特征类型对机器学习方法有影响，从而影响消歧性能。在这项工作中，我们已经评估了几种类型的特征，从歧义词的上下文中得到，我们还探索了使用词嵌入从MEDLINE得到的更多全局特征。结果表明，词嵌入提高了更多传统特征的性能，并允许使用基于长短期记忆（LSTM）节点的递归神经网络分类器。 unigrams和word嵌入与SVM的组合设置了MSH WSD数据集中的宏观精度为95.97的新的性能状态。
