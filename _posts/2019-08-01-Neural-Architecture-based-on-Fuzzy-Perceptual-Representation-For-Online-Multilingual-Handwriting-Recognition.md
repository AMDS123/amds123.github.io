##### Abstract
Due to the omnipresence of mobile devices, online handwritten scripts have become the most important feeding input to smartphones and tablet devices. To increase online handwriting recognition performance, deeper neural networks have extensively been used. In this context, our paper handles the problem of online handwritten script recognition based on extraction features system and deep approach system for sequences classification. Many solutions have appeared in order to facilitate the recognition of handwriting. Accordingly, we used an existent method and combined with new classifiers in order to get a flexible system. Good results are achieved compared to online characters and words recognition system on Latin and Arabic scripts. The performance of our two proposed systems is assessed by using five databases. Indeed, the recognition rate exceeds 98%.
