##### Abstract
Non-intrusive inspection systems based on X-ray radiography techniques are routinely used at transport hubs to ensure the conformity of cargo content with the supplied shipping manifest. As trade volumes increase and regulations become more stringent, manual inspection by trained operators is less and less viable due to low throughput. Machine vision techniques can assist operators in their task by automating parts of the inspection workflow. Since cars are routinely involved in trafficking, export fraud, and tax evasion schemes, they represent an attractive target for automated detection and flagging for subsequent inspection by operators. In this contribution, we describe a method for the detection of cars in X-ray cargo images based on trained-from-scratch Convolutional Neural Networks. By introducing an oversampling scheme that suitably addresses the low number of car images available for training, we achieved 100% car image classification rate for a false positive rate of 1-in-454. Cars that were partially or completely obscured by other goods, a modus operandi frequently adopted by criminals, were correctly detected. We believe that this level of performance suggests that the method is suitable for deployment in the field. It is expected that the generic object detection workflow described can be extended to other object classes given the availability of suitable training data.

在交通枢纽常规使用基于X射线照相技术的非侵入式检查系统，以确保货物内容与提供的货运清单一致。随着贸易量的增加和法规的变得更加严格，由于低吞吐量，受过培训的操作人员的人工检查越来越不可行。机器视觉技术可以通过自动化检查工作流程的一部分来帮助操作人员完成任务。由于汽车经常涉及贩运，出口欺诈和逃税计划，因此它们是自动检测和标记以供操作员随后检查的有吸引力的目标。在这个贡献中，我们描述了一种基于经过训练的从头开始的卷积神经网络在X射线货物图像中检测汽车的方法。通过引入适当解决可用于训练的车辆图像的低数量的过采样方案，我们实现了100％的汽车图像分类率，误判率为1比454。被其他货物部分或完全遮挡的车辆，犯罪分子经常采用的手法被正确检测到。我们认为，这一水平的表现表明，这种方法适合在现场部署。预计所描述的通用对象检测工作流程可以扩展到其他对象类别，只要有合适的训练数据。
