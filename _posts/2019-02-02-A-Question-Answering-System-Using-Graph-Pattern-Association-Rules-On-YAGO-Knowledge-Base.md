##### Abstract
A question answering system (QA System) was developed that uses graph-pattern association rules on the YAGO knowledge base. The answer as output of the system is provided based on a user question as input. If the answer is missing or unavailable in the database, then graph-pattern association rules are used to get the answer. The architecture of this question answering system is as follows: question classification, graph component generation, query generation, and query processing. The question answering system uses association graph patterns in a waterfall model. In this paper, the architecture of the system is described, specifically discussing its reasoning and performance capabilities. The results of this research is that rules with high confidence and correct logic produce correct answers, and vice versa
