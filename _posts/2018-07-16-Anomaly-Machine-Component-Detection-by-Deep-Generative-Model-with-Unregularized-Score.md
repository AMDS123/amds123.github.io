##### Abstract
One of the most common needs in manufacturing plants is rejecting products not coincident with the standards as anomalies. Accurate and automatic anomaly detection improves product reliability and reduces inspection cost. Probabilistic models have been employed to detect test samples with lower likelihoods as anomalies in unsupervised manner. Recently, a probabilistic model called deep generative model (DGM) has been proposed for end-to-end modeling of natural images and already achieved a certain success. However, anomaly detection of machine components with complicated structures is still challenging because they produce a wide variety of normal image patches with low likelihoods. For overcoming this difficulty, we propose unregularized score for the DGM. As its name implies, the unregularized score is the anomaly score of the DGM without the regularization terms. The unregularized score is robust to the inherent complexity of a sample and has a smaller risk of rejecting a sample appearing less frequently but being coincident with the standards.

制造工厂最常见的需求之一是拒绝与标准不一致的产品作为异常。准确的自动异常检测可提高产品可靠性并降低检测成本。已经采用概率模型来检测具有较低可能性的测试样本作为无监督方式的异常。最近，已经提出了一种称为深度生成模型（DGM）的概率模型用于自然图像的端到端建模，并且已经取得了一定的成功。然而，具有复杂结构的机器部件的异常检测仍然具有挑战性，因为它们产生具有低可能性的各种正常图像块。为了克服这个困难，我们建议DGM的非正规分数。顾名思义，非正规化得分是没有正则化项的DGM的异常得分。非常规得分对样本固有的复杂性很强，并且拒绝样本出现频率较低但与标准一致的风险较小。
