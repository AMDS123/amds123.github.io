##### Abstract
In this paper we propose an energy-efficient camera-based gesture recognition system powered by light energy for "always on" applications. Low energy consumption is achieved by directly extracting gesture features from the compressed measurements, which are the block averages and the linear combinations of the image sensor's pixel values. The gestures are recognized using a nearest-neighbour (NN) classifier followed by Dynamic Time Warping (DTW). The system has been implemented on an Analog Devices Black Fin ULP vision processor and powered by PV cells whose output is regulated by TI's DC-DC buck converter with Maximum Power Point Tracking (MPPT). Measured data reveals that with only 400 compressed measurements (768x compression ratio) per frame, the system is able to recognize key wake-up gestures with greater than 80% accuracy and only 95mJ of energy per frame. Owing to its fully self-powered operation, the proposed system can find wide applications in "always-on" vision systems such as in surveillance, robotics and consumer electronics with touch-less operation.

在本文中，我们提出了一种基于能量的基于照相机的手势识别系统，该系统由光源驱动，用于“永远在线”的应用。通过直接从压缩测量中提取手势特征来实现低能量消耗，压缩测量是块平均和图像传感器的像素值的线性组合。使用最近邻居（NN）分类器，随后动态时间规整（DTW）来识别手势。该系统在ADI公司的Black Fin ULP视觉处理器上实现，并由光伏电池供电，其输出由TI的DC-DC降压转换器和最大功率点跟踪（MPPT）进行调节。测量数据显示，每帧只有400次压缩测量（768倍压缩比），系统能够以高于80％的精度识别关键的唤醒手势，每帧只有95mJ的能量。由于其完全自供电操作，所提出的系统可以在“永远在线”的视觉系统（例如监视，机器人和消费电子产品）中广泛应用，并具有非触摸操作。
