##### Abstract
People detection in single 2D images has improved greatly in recent years. However, comparatively little of this progress has percolated into multi-camera multi-people tracking algorithms, whose performance still degrades severely when scenes become very crowded. In this work, we introduce a new architecture that combines Convolutional Neural Nets and Conditional Random Fields to explicitly model those ambiguities. One of its key ingredients are high-order CRF terms that model potential occlusions and give our approach its robustness even when many people are present. Our model is trained end-to-end and we show that it outperforms several state-of-art algorithms on challenging scenes.

单个2D图像中的人员检测近年来有了很大的改进。然而，这种进步的相对较少已渗透到多摄像机多人追踪算法中，当场景变得非常拥挤时，其性能仍然严重下降。在这项工作中，我们引入了一个新的架构，结合了卷积神经网络和条件随机场来明确地模拟这些模糊。它的一个关键要素是高阶CRF术语，它模拟潜在的阻塞，即使在很多人在场的情况下，我们的方法仍然具有鲁棒性。我们的模型是端到端的训练，我们证明它在挑战性的场景上胜过了几种最先进的算法。
