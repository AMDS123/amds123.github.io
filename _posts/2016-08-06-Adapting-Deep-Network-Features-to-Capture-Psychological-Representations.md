##### Abstract
Deep neural networks have become increasingly successful at solving classic perception problems such as object recognition, semantic segmentation, and scene understanding, often reaching or surpassing human-level accuracy. This success is due in part to the ability of DNNs to learn useful representations of high-dimensional inputs, a problem that humans must also solve. We examine the relationship between the representations learned by these networks and human psychological representations recovered from similarity judgments. We find that deep features learned in service of object classification account for a significant amount of the variance in human similarity judgments for a set of animal images. However, these features do not capture some qualitative distinctions that are a key part of human representations. To remedy this, we develop a method for adapting deep features to align with human similarity judgments, resulting in image representations that can potentially be used to extend the scope of psychological experiments.

深度神经网络在解决诸如对象识别，语义分割和场景理解等经典感知问题方面越来越成功，经常达到或超过人类的准确性。这一成功部分归功于DNN学习高维输入的有用表示的能力，这也是人类必须解决的问题。我们研究这些网络所学的表征与从相似性判断中恢复的人类心理表征之间的关系。我们发现，服务于对象分类的深层特征对于一组动物图像的人类相似性判断存在显着的方差。然而，这些特征并不能捕捉到人类表征的关键部分的一些定性区别。为了解决这个问题，我们开发了一种方法来调整深度特征，以便与人类相似性判断相一致，从而产生可以用来扩展心理实验范围的图像表示。
