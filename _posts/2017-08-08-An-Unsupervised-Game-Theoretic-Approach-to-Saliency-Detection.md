##### Abstract
We propose a novel unsupervised game-theoretic salient object detection algorithm that does not require labeled training data. First, saliency detection problem is formulated as a non-cooperative game, hereinafter referred to as Saliency Game, in which image regions are players who choose to be "background" or "foreground" as their pure strategies. A payoff function is constructed by exploiting multiple cues and combining complementary features. Saliency maps are generated according to each region's strategy in the Nash equilibrium of the proposed Saliency Game. Second, we explore the complementary relationship between color and deep features and propose an Iterative Random Walk algorithm to combine saliency maps produced by the Saliency Game using different features. Iterative random walk allows sharing information across feature spaces, and detecting objects that are otherwise very hard to detect. Extensive experiments over 6 challenging datasets demonstrate the superiority of our proposed unsupervised algorithm compared to several state of the art supervised algorithms.

我们提出了一种新的无监督的博弈论显着物体检测算法，不需要标记的训练数据。首先，显着性检测问题被表述为非合作博弈，以下称为“显着性博弈”，其中图像区域是选择“背景”或“前景”作为其纯策略的参与者。支付功能是通过利用多个线索并结合互补功能构建的。在显着性博弈的纳什均衡中根据每个区域的策略产生显着性图。其次，探讨了颜色与深度特征之间的互补关系，提出了一种迭代随机游走算法，以组合显着性博弈生成的显着性地图，使用不同的特征。迭代随机游走允许在特征空间之间共享信息，并检测否则很难检测到的对象。对6个具有挑战性的数据集进行了大量的实验，证明了我们提出的无监督算法与几种最先进的监督算法相比的优越性。
