##### Abstract
As machines have become more intelligent, there has been a renewed interest in methods for measuring their intelligence. A common approach is to propose tasks for which a human excels, but one which machines find difficult. However, an ideal task should also be easy to evaluate and not be easily gameable. We begin with a case study exploring the recently popular task of image captioning and its limitations as a task for measuring machine intelligence. An alternative and more promising task is Visual Question Answering that tests a machine's ability to reason about language and vision. We describe a dataset unprecedented in size created for the task that contains over 760,000 human generated questions about images. Using around 10 million human generated answers, machines may be easily evaluated.

随着机器变得更加智能化，对测量智能的方法重新产生兴趣。一个常见的方法是提出一个人擅长的任务，但是机器难以找到的任务。然而，一个理想的任务也应该是容易评估，不容易游戏。我们从案例研究开始，探索最近流行的图像字幕任务及其作为测量机器智能任务的局限性。另一个更有前途的任务是视觉问答系统（Visual Question Answering），它测试机器推理语言和视觉的能力。我们描述了一个数据集，其中包含超过760,000个人类生成的关于图像的问题。使用大约1000万人类生成的答案，机器可能很容易评估。
