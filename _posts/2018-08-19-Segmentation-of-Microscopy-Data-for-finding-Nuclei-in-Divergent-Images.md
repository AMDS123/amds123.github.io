##### Abstract
Every year millions of people die due to disease of Cancer. Due to its invasive nature it is very complex to cure even in primary stages. Hence, only method to survive this disease completely is via forecasting by analyzing the early mutation in cells of the patient biopsy. Cell Segmentation can be used to find cell which have left their nuclei. This enables faster cure and high rate of survival. Cell counting is a hard, yet tedious task that would greatly benefit from automation. To accomplish this task, segmentation of cells need to be accurate. In this paper, we have improved the learning of training data by our network. It can annotate precise masks on test data. we examine the strength of activation functions in medical image segmentation task by improving learning rates by our proposed Carving Technique. Identifying the cells nuclei is the starting point for most analyses, identifying nuclei allows researchers to identify each individual cell in a sample, and by measuring how cells react to various treatments, the researcher can understand the underlying biological processes at work. Experimental results shows the efficiency of the proposed work.

##### Abstract (translated by Google)
每年有数百万人因癌症而死亡。由于其侵入性，即使在初级阶段也很难治愈。因此，只有通过分析患者活组织检查细胞中的早期突变来预测，才能完全存活这种疾病。细胞分割可用于发现已经离开其细胞核的细胞。这可以实现更快的固化和高生存率。细胞计数是一项艰巨而又乏味的任务，可以从自动化中获益。要完成此任务，细胞的分割需要准确。在本文中，我们通过网络改进了对培训数据的学习。它可以在测试数据上注释精确的掩码。我们通过提出的雕刻技术提高学习率来检验医学图像分割任务中激活函数的强度。识别细胞核是大多数分析的起点，识别细胞核允许研究人员识别样品中的每个细胞，并通过测量细胞对各种治疗的反应，研究人员可以了解工作中潜在的生物学过程。实验结果表明了所提出的工作效率。
