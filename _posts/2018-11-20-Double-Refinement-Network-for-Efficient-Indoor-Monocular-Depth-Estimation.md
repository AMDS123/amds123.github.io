##### Abstract
Monocular Depth Estimation is an important problem of Computer Vision that may be solved with Neural Networks and Deep Learning nowadays. Though recent works in this area have shown significant improvement in accuracy, state-of-the-art methods require large memory and time resources. The main purpose of this paper is to improve performance of the latest solutions with no decrease in accuracy. To achieve this, we propose a Double Refinement Network architecture. We evaluate the results using the standard benchmark RGB-D dataset NYU Depth v2. The results are equal to the current state-of-the-art, while frames per second rate of our approach is significantly higher (up to 15 times speedup per image with batch size 1), RAM per image is significantly lower.
