##### Abstract
Multi-task learning (MTL) is useful for domains in which data originates from multiple sources that are individually under-sampled. MTL methods are able to learn classification models that have higher performance as compared to learning a single model by aggregating all the data together or learning a separate model for each data source. The performance of these methods relies on label accuracy. We address the problem of simultaneously learning multiple classifiers in the MTL framework when the training data has imprecise labels. We assume that there is an additional source of information that provides a score for each instance which reflects the certainty about its label. Modeling this score as being generated by an underlying ranking function, we augment the MTL framework with an added layer of supervision. This results in new MTL methods that are able to learn accurate classifiers while preserving the domain structure provided through the rank information. We apply these methods to the task of detecting abnormal cortical regions in the MRIs of patients suffering from focal epilepsy whose MRI were read as normal by expert neuroradiologists. In addition to the noisy labels provided by the results of surgical resection, we employ the results of an invasive intracranial-EEG exam as an additional source of label information. Our proposed methods are able to successfully detect abnormal regions for all patients in our dataset and achieve a higher performance as compared to baseline methods.

多任务学习（MTL）对于数据源自单个欠采样的多个源的域是有用的。与学习单一模型相比，MTL方法能够学习具有更高性能的分类模型，方法是将所有数据汇总在一起，或者为每个数据源学习单独的模型。这些方法的性能依赖于标签的准确性。当训练数据具有不精确的标签时，我们解决了在MTL框架中同时学习多个分类器的问题。我们假设有一个额外的信息来源为每个反映其标签确定性的实例提供评分。将这个分数建模为基础排序函数生成的，我们用一个额外的监督层来增加MTL框架。这导致新的MTL方法能够学习准确的分类器，同时保持通过秩信息提供的域结构。我们将这些方法应用于检测患有局灶性癫痫的患者的MRI中异常皮质区域的任务，其中MRI由专家神经放射学家正常阅读。除了手术切除结果提供的噪音标签之外，我们还将侵入式颅内EEG检查结果作为标签信息的附加来源。我们提出的方法能够成功地检测到我们的数据集中的所有患者的异常区域，并且与基线方法相比实现更高的性能。
