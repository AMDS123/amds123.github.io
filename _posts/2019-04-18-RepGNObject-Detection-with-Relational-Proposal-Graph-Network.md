##### Abstract
Region based object detectors achieve the state-of-the-art performance, but few consider to model the relation of proposals. In this paper, we explore the idea of modeling the relationships among the proposals for object detection from the graph learning perspective. Specifically, we present relational proposal graph network (RepGN) which is defined on object proposals and the semantic and spatial relation modeled as the edge. By integrating our RepGN module into object detectors, the relation and context constraints will be introduced to the feature extraction of regions and bounding boxes regression and classification. Besides, we propose a novel graph-cut based pooling layer for hierarchical coarsening of the graph, which empowers the RepGN module to exploit the inter-regional correlation and scene description in a hierarchical manner. We perform extensive experiments on COCO object detection dataset and show promising results.
