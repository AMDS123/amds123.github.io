##### Abstract
Asymmetry analysis based on the overlapping of thermal images proved able to detect inflammation and, predict foot ulceration. This technique involves three main steps: segmentation, geometric transformation, and overlapping. However, the overlapping technique, which consists of subtracting the intensity levels of the right foot from those of the left foot, can also detect false abnormal areas if the projections of the left and right feet are not the same. In this paper, we present an alternative technique to asymmetry analysis-based overlapping. The proposed technique, scalable scanning, allows for an effective comparison even if the shapes and sizes of the feet projections appear differently in the image. The tested results show that asymmetry analysis- based scalable scanning provides fewer false abnormal areas than does asymmetry analysis -based overlapping.

基于热图像重叠的不对称分析证明能够检测炎症并预测足部溃疡。这种技术涉及三个主要步骤：分割，几何变换和重叠。然而，如果左脚和右脚的投影不相同，则从左脚的右脚减去右脚的强度级别的重叠技术也可以检测到错误的异常区域。在本文中，我们提出了一种替代技术来基于不对称分析的重叠。所提出的技术，即可伸缩扫描，即使图像中的脚投影的形状和尺寸不同，也可以进行有效的比较。测试结果显示，基于不对称分析的可扩展扫描比不对称分析基于重叠提供更少的错误异常区域。
