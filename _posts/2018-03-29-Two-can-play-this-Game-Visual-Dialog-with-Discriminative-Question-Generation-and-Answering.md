##### Abstract
Human conversation is a complex mechanism with subtle nuances. It is hence an ambitious goal to develop artificial intelligence agents that can participate fluently in a conversation. While we are still far from achieving this goal, recent progress in visual question answering, image captioning, and visual question generation shows that dialog systems may be realizable in the not too distant future. To this end, a novel dataset was introduced recently and encouraging results were demonstrated, particularly for question answering. In this paper, we demonstrate a simple symmetric discriminative baseline, that can be applied to both predicting an answer as well as predicting a question. We show that this method performs on par with the state of the art, even memory net based methods. In addition, for the first time on the visual dialog dataset, we assess the performance of a system asking questions, and demonstrate how visual dialog can be generated from discriminative question generation and question answering.

##### Abstract (translated by Google)
人类对话是一种复杂的机制，具有微妙的细微差别。因此，开发能够流利地参与对话的人工智能代理是一个雄心勃勃的目标。虽然我们距离实现这一目标还有很长的路要走，但最近在视觉问答，图像字幕和视觉问题生成方面取得的进展表明，对话系统可能在不久的将来实现。为此，最近引入了一个新的数据集，并证明了令人鼓舞的结果，特别是对于问答。在本文中，我们展示了一个简单的对称判别基线，可以应用于预测答案和预测问题。我们证明了这种方法与现有技术，即使是基于内存网的方法相当。此外，我们第一次在可视对话数据集中评估系统提问的性能，并演示如何通过判别问题生成和问答来生成视觉对话。
