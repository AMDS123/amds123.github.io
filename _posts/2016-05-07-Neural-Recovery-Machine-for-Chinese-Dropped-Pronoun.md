##### Abstract
Dropped pronouns (DPs) are ubiquitous in pro-drop languages like Chinese, Japanese etc. Previous work mainly focused on painstakingly exploring the empirical features for DPs recovery. In this paper, we propose a neural recovery machine (NRM) to model and recover DPs in Chinese, so that to avoid the non-trivial feature engineering process. The experimental results show that the proposed NRM significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches on both two heterogeneous datasets. Further experiment results of Chinese zero pronoun (ZP) resolution show that the performance of ZP resolution can also be improved by recovering the ZPs to DPs.

放弃的代词（DPs）在中国，日本等亲语言中普遍存在。以往的工作主要集中于艰辛探索DPs恢复的经验性特征。在本文中，我们提出了神经恢复机（NRM）来建模和恢复汉语中的DP，从而避免了非平凡的特征工程过程。实验结果表明，在两个异构数据集上，所提出的NRM显着优于最先进的方法。中国零代词（ZP）分辨率的进一步实验结果表明，ZP分辨率的性能也可以通过将ZP恢复到DP来改善。
