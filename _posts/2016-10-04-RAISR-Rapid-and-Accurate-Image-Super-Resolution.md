##### Abstract
Given an image, we wish to produce an image of larger size with significantly more pixels and higher image quality. This is generally known as the Single Image Super-Resolution (SISR) problem. The idea is that with sufficient training data (corresponding pairs of low and high resolution images) we can learn set of filters (i.e. a mapping) that when applied to given image that is not in the training set, will produce a higher resolution version of it, where the learning is preferably low complexity. In our proposed approach, the run-time is more than one to two orders of magnitude faster than the best competing methods currently available, while producing results comparable or better than state-of-the-art. A closely related topic is image sharpening and contrast enhancement, i.e., improving the visual quality of a blurry image by amplifying the underlying details (a wide range of frequencies). Our approach additionally includes an extremely efficient way to produce an image that is significantly sharper than the input blurry one, without introducing artifacts such as halos and noise amplification. We illustrate how this effective sharpening algorithm, in addition to being of independent interest, can be used as a pre-processing step to induce the learning of more effective upscaling filters with built-in sharpening and contrast enhancement effect.

给定一个图像，我们希望产生更大的图像，更多的像素和更高的图像质量。这通常被称为单图超分辨率（SISR）问题。这个想法是，在足够的训练数据（相应的低分辨率图像和高分辨率图像对）下，我们可以学习一组滤波器（即映射），当应用于不在训练集中的给定图像时，将产生更高分辨率的它在哪里学习最好是低复杂度。在我们提出的方法中，运行时间比目前可用的最好的竞争方法快一到两个数量级，而产生的结果与现有技术相比甚至更好。紧密相关的话题是图像锐化和对比度增强，即通过放大下面的细节（宽范围的频率）来改善模糊图像的视觉质量。我们的方法还包括一个非常有效的方法来产生比输入模糊的图像明显更清晰的图像，而不会引入诸如光晕和噪声放大之类的伪影。我们举例说明这种有效的锐化算法除了具有独立的兴趣外，还可以作为一个预处理步骤来诱导对内置锐化和对比度增强效果的更有效的升频滤波器的学习。
