##### Abstract
Data-intensive applications are growing at an increasing rate and there is a growing need to solve scalability and high-performance issues in them. By the advent of Cloud computing paradigm, it became possible to harness remote resources to build and deploy these applications. In recent years, new set of applications and services based on Internet of Things (IoT) paradigm, require to process large amount of data in very less time. Among them surveillance and object detection have gained prime importance, but cloud is unable to bring down the network latencies to meet the response time requirements. This problem is solved by Fog computing which harnesses resources in the edge of the network along with remote cloud resources as required. However, there is still a lack of frameworks that are successfully able to integrate sophisticated software and applications, especially deep learning, with fog and cloud computing environments. In this work, we propose a framework to deploy deep learning-based applications in fog-cloud environments to harness edge and cloud resources to provide better service quality for such applications. Our proposed framework, called EdgeLens, adapts to the application or user requirements to provide high accuracy or low latency modes of services. We also tested the performance of the software in terms of accuracy, response time, jitter, network bandwidth and power consumption and show how EdgeLens adapts to different service requirements.
