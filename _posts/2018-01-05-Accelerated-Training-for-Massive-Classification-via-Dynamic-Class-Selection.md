##### Abstract
Massive classification, a classification task defined over a vast number of classes (hundreds of thousands or even millions), has become an essential part of many real-world systems, such as face recognition. Existing methods, including the deep networks that achieved remarkable success in recent years, were mostly devised for problems with a moderate number of classes. They would meet with substantial difficulties, e.g. excessive memory demand and computational cost, when applied to massive problems. We present a new method to tackle this problem. This method can efficiently and accurately identify a small number of "active classes" for each mini-batch, based on a set of dynamic class hierarchies constructed on the fly. We also develop an adaptive allocation scheme thereon, which leads to a better tradeoff between performance and cost. On several large-scale benchmarks, our method significantly reduces the training cost and memory demand, while maintaining competitive performance.

大规模分类是在许多类（数十万甚至数百万）上定义的分类任务，已经成为许多现实世界系统（如人脸识别）的重要组成部分。现有的方法，包括近年来取得显着成就的深层网络，大都是针对中等课程的问题而设计的。他们会遇到很多困难，例如过度的内存需求和计算成本，应用于大规模的问题。我们提出了一个新的方法来解决这个问题。这种方法可以基于一组在动态构建的动态类层次结构，为每个小批量高效准确地识别少量的“活动类”。我们还开发了一个适应性分配方案，从而在性能和成本之间取得更好的折衷。在几个大规模的基准测试中，我们的方法大大降低了培训成本和内存需求，同时保持了竞争性能。
