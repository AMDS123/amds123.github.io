##### Abstract
The propagation of sound in a shallow water environment is characterized by boundary reflections from the sea surface and sea floor. These reflections result in multiple (indirect) sound propagation paths, which can degrade the performance of passive sound source localization methods. This paper proposes the use of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for the localization of sources of broadband acoustic radiated noise (such as motor vessels) in shallow water multipath environments. It is shown that CNNs operating on cepstrogram and generalized cross-correlogram inputs are able to more reliably estimate the instantaneous range and bearing of transiting motor vessels when the source localization performance of conventional passive ranging methods is degraded. The ensuing improvement in source localization performance is demonstrated using real data collected during an at-sea experiment.

声音在浅水环境中传播的特征是来自海面和海底的边界反射。这些反射导致多个（间接）声音传播路径，这会降低被动声源定位方法的性能。本文提出利用卷积神经网络（CNN）对浅水多路径环境中的宽带声辐射噪声源（如电机船）进行定位。结果表明，当传统无源测距方法的源定位性能降低时，运行在等概率和广义互相关图输入上的CNN能够更可靠地估计过渡电机船的瞬时距离和方位。随后在海上实验中收集的真实数据证明了源定位性能的改善。
