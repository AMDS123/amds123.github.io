##### Abstract
With the rise of knowledge management and knowledge economy, the knowledge elements that directly link and embody the knowledge system have become the research focus and hotspot in certain areas. The existing knowledge element representation methods are limited in functions to deal with the formality, logic and reasoning. Based on description logic ALC and the common knowledge element model, in order to describe the knowledge element, the description logic ALC is expanded. The concept is extended to two diferent ones (that is, the object knowledge element concept and the attribute knowledge element concept). The relationship is extended to three (that is, relationship between object knowledge element concept and attribute knowledge element concept, relationship among object knowledge element concepts, relationship among attribute knowledge element concepts), and the inverse relationship constructor is added to propose a description logic KEDL system. By demonstrating, the relevant properties, such as completeness, reliability,of the described logic system KEDL are obtained. Finally, it is verified by the example that the description logic KEDL system has strong knowledge element description ability.
