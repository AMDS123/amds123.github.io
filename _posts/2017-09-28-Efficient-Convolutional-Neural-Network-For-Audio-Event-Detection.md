##### Abstract
Wireless distributed systems as used in sensor networks, Internet-of-Things and cyber-physical systems, impose high requirements on resource efficiency. Advanced preprocessing and classification of data at the network edge can help to decrease the communication demand and to reduce the amount of data to be processed centrally. In the area of distributed acoustic sensing, the combination of algorithms with a high classification rate and resource-constraint embedded systems is essential. Unfortunately, algorithms for acoustic event detection have a high memory and computational demand and are not suited for execution at the network edge. This paper addresses these aspects by applying structural optimizations to a convolutional neural network for audio event detection to reduce the memory requirement by a factor of more than 500 and the computational effort by a factor of 2.1 while performing 9.2% better.

用于传感器网络，物联网和网络物理系统的无线分布式系统对资源效率提出了很高的要求。网络边缘数据的高级预处理和分类有助于减少通信需求，减少集中处理的数据量。在分布式声学传感领域，具有高分类率和资源约束的嵌入式系统的算法是必不可少的。遗憾的是，用于声音事件检测的算法具有较高的存储器和计算需求，并且不适合在网络边缘执行。本文针对这些方面，通过对卷积神经网络进行音频​​事件检测的结构优化，将内存需求减少500多倍，计算量减少2.1倍，同时性能提高9.2％。
