##### Abstract
SLAM has matured significantly over the past few years, and is beginning to appear in serious commercial products. While new SLAM systems are being proposed at every conference, evaluation is often restricted to qualitative visualizations or accuracy estimation against a ground truth. This is due to the lack of benchmarking methodologies which can holistically and quantitatively evaluate these systems. Further investigation at the level of individual kernels and parameter spaces of SLAM pipelines is non-existent, which is absolutely essential for systems research and integration. We extend the recently introduced SLAMBench framework to allow comparing two state-of-the-art SLAM pipelines, namely KinectFusion and LSD-SLAM, along the metrics of accuracy, energy consumption, and processing frame rate on two different hardware platforms, namely a desktop and an embedded device. We also analyze the pipelines at the level of individual kernels and explore their algorithmic and hardware design spaces for the first time, yielding valuable insights.

SLAM在过去几年已经成熟，并开始出现在严肃的商业产品中。虽然在每个会议上都提出了新的SLAM系统，但评估通常仅限于定性的可视化或对照实际情况进行准确性评估。这是由于缺乏能够整体和定量评估这些系统的基准方法。在SLAM管道的个别核心和参数空间层面进一步研究是不存在的，这对于系统研究和集成是绝对必要的。我们扩展了最近推出的SLAMBench框架，以允许在两个不同的硬件平台上，比较两个最先进的SLAM流水线，即KinectFusion和LSD-SLAM，以及准确度，能耗和处理帧率等指标。和嵌入式设备。我们还分析了各个内核级别的流水线，并首次探索了它们的算法和硬件设计空间，从而获得了宝贵的见解。
