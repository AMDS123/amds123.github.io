##### Abstract
Small object segmentation is a common task in medical image analysis. Traditional feature-based methods require human intervention while methods based on deep learning train the neural network automatically. However, it is still error prone when applying deep learning methods for small objects. In this paper, Focal FCN was proposed for small object segmentation with limited training data. Firstly, Fully-weighted FCN was proposed to apply an initialization for Focal FCN by adding weights to the background and foreground loss. Secondly, focal loss was applied to make the training focus on wrongly-classified pixels and hence achieve good performance on small object segmentation. Comparisons between FCN, Weighted FCN, Fully-weighted FCN and Focal FCN were tested on customized stent graft marker segmentation.

小物体分割是医学图像分析中的常见任务。传统的基于特征的方法需要人为干预，而基于深度学习的方法自动训练神经网络。然而，对小物体应用深度学习方法仍然是错误的。本文提出了一种基于有限训练数据的小目标分割方法。首先，提出了完全加权的FCN，通过对背景和前景损失加权来应用Focal FCN的初始化。其次，利用焦点损失使训练集中在错误分类的像素上，从而在小物体分割上取得良好效果。 FCN，加权FCN，完全加权FCN和局灶性FCN的比较在定制的覆膜支架标记物分割上进行测试。
