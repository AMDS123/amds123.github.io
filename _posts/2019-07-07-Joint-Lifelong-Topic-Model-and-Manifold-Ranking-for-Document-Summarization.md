##### Abstract
Due to the manifold ranking method has a significant effect on the ranking of unknown data based on known data by using a weighted network, many researchers use the manifold ranking method to solve the document summarization task. However, their models only consider the original features but ignore the semantic features of sentences when they construct the weighted networks for the manifold ranking method. To solve this problem, we proposed two improved models based on the manifold ranking method. One is combining the topic model and manifold ranking method (JTMMR) to solve the document summarization task. This model not only uses the original feature, but also uses the semantic feature to represent the document, which can improve the accuracy of the manifold ranking method. The other one is combining the lifelong topic model and manifold ranking method (JLTMMR). On the basis of the JTMMR, this model adds the constraint of knowledge to improve the quality of the topic. At the same time, we also add the constraint of the relationship between documents to dig out a better document semantic features. The JTMMR model can improve the effect of the manifold ranking method by using the better semantic feature. Experiments show that our models can achieve a better result than other baseline models for multi-document summarization task. At the same time, our models also have a good performance on the single document summarization task. After combining with a few basic surface features, our model significantly outperforms some model based on deep learning in recent years. After that, we also do an exploring work for lifelong machine learning by analyzing the effect of adding feedback. Experiments show that the effect of adding feedback to our model is significant.
