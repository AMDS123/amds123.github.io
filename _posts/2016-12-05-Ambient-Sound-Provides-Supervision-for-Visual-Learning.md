##### Abstract
The sound of crashing waves, the roar of fast-moving cars -- sound conveys important information about the objects in our surroundings. In this work, we show that ambient sounds can be used as a supervisory signal for learning visual models. To demonstrate this, we train a convolutional neural network to predict a statistical summary of the sound associated with a video frame. We show that, through this process, the network learns a representation that conveys information about objects and scenes. We evaluate this representation on several recognition tasks, finding that its performance is comparable to that of other state-of-the-art unsupervised learning methods. Finally, we show through visualizations that the network learns units that are selective to objects that are often associated with characteristic sounds.

轰鸣的声音，快速移动的汽车的轰鸣声，传达了我们周围物体的重要信息。在这项工作中，我们展示了环境声音可以用作学习视觉模型的监督信号。为了证明这一点，我们训练卷积神经网络来预测与视频帧相关的声音的统计总结。我们表明，通过这个过程，网络学习表达传达关于对象和场景的信息。我们评估这种表示在几个识别任务，发现其性能是相当于其他国家的最先进的无监督的学习方法。最后，我们通过可视化表明，网络学习对通常与特征声音相关的对象有选择性的单元。
