##### Abstract
Driven by applications like Micro Aerial Vehicles (MAVs), driver-less cars, etc, localization solution has become an active research topic in the past decade. In recent years, Ultra Wideband (UWB) emerged as a promising technology because of its impressive performance in both indoor and outdoor positioning. But algorithms relying only on UWB sensor usually result in high latency and low bandwidth, which is undesirable in some situations such as controlling a MAV. To alleviate this problem, an Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) based algorithm is proposed to fuse the Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) and UWB, which achieved 80Hz 3D localization with significantly improved accuracy and almost no delay. To verify the effectiveness and reliability of the proposed approach, a swarm of 6 MAVs is set up to perform a light show in an indoor exhibition hall.

在微型飞行器（MAV），无人驾驶汽车等应用的推动下，本地化解决方案在过去十年中已成为一个活跃的研究课题。近年来，超宽带（UWB）因其在室内和室外定位方面的出色表现而成为一种很有前景的技术。但是仅依赖于UWB传感器的算法通常导致高延迟和低带宽，这在诸如控制MAV的某些情况下是不期望的。为了缓解这个问题，提出了一种基于扩展卡尔曼滤波器（EKF）的融合惯性测量单元（IMU）和UWB的算法，该算法实现了80Hz的3D定位，精度显着提高，几乎没有延迟。为了验证所提出的方法的有效性和可靠性，建立了一组6个MAV以在室内展厅中进行灯光秀。视频和源代码可在https://github.com/lijx10/uwb-localization获得
