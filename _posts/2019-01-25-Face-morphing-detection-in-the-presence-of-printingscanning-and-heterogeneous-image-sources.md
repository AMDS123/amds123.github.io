##### Abstract
Face morphing represents nowadays a big security threat in the context of electronic identity documents as well as an interesting challenge for researchers in the field of face recognition. Despite of the good performance obtained by state-of-the-art approaches on digital images, no satisfactory solutions have been identified so far to deal with cross-database testing and printed-scanned images (typically used in many countries for document issuing). In this work, novel approaches are proposed to train Deep Neural Networks for morphing detection: in particular generation of simulated printed-scanned images together with other data augmentation strategies and pre-training on large face recognition datasets, allowed to reach state-of-the-art accuracy on challenging datasets from heterogeneous image sources.
