##### Abstract
Theatrical improvisation (impro or improv) is a demanding form of live, collaborative performance. Improv is a humorous and playful artform built on an open-ended narrative structure which simultaneously celebrates effort and failure. It is thus an ideal test bed for the development and deployment of interactive artificial intelligence (AI)-based conversational agents, or artificial improvisors. This case study introduces an improv show experiment featuring human actors and artificial improvisors. We have previously developed a deep-learning-based artificial improvisor, trained on movie subtitles, that can generate plausible, context-based, lines of dialogue suitable for theatre (Mathewson and Mirowski 2017). In this work, we have employed it to control what a subset of human actors say during an improv performance. We also give human-generated lines to a different subset of performers. All lines are provided to actors with headphones and all performers are wearing headphones. This paper describes a Turing test, or imitation game, taking place in a theatre, with both the audience members and the performers left to guess who is a human and who is a machine. In order to test scientific hypotheses about the perception of humans versus machines we collect anonymous feedback from volunteer performers and audience members. Our results suggest that rehearsal increases proficiency and possibility to control events in the performance. That said, consistency with real world experience is limited by the interface and the mechanisms used to perform the show. We also show that human-generated lines are shorter, more positive, and have less difficult words with more grammar and spelling mistakes than the artificial improvisor generated lines.

戏剧即兴（即兴或即兴）是一种苛刻的现场协作表演形式。 Improv是一种幽默而有趣的艺术形式，建立在开放式叙事结构的基础上，同时也是为了庆祝努力和失败。因此，它是开发和部署基于交互式人工智能（AI）的会话代理或人工即兴创作者的理想测试平台。本案例研究介绍了以人类演员和人工即兴演奏者为特色的即兴表演实验。我们之前已经开发了一种基于深度学习的人工即兴创作者，他们接受过电影字幕培训，可以产生适合戏剧的合理的，基于情境的对话线（Mathewson和Mirowski 2017）。在这项工作中，我们使用它来控制人类演员在即兴表演中所说的内容。我们还将人类生成的线条提供给不同的表演者子集。所有线路都提供给带耳机的演员，所有表演者都戴着耳机。本文描述了一个在剧院中进行的图灵测试或模仿游戏，观众和表演者都会猜测谁是人，谁是机器。为了测试关于人与机器感知的科学假设，我们收集了志愿者和观众的匿名反馈。我们的研究结果表明，排练提高了熟练程度和控制表演事件的可能性。也就是说，与现实世界经验的一致性受到界面和用于执行节目的机制的限制。我们还表明，与人工即兴创作的行相比，人类生成的行更短，更积极，并且具有更少的语法和拼写错误。
