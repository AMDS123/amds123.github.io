##### Abstract
This paper presents a novel Differential Evolution algorithm for protein folding optimization that is applied to a three-dimensional AB off-lattice model. The proposed algorithm includes two new mechanisms. A local search is used to improve convergence speed and to reduce the runtime complexity of the energy calculation. For this purpose, a local movement is introduced within the local search. The designed evolutionary algorithm has fast convergence speed and, therefore, when it is trapped into the local optimum or a relatively good solution is located, it is hard to locate a better similar solution. The similar solution is different from the good solution in only a few components. A component reinitialization method is designed to mitigate this problem. Both the new mechanisms and the proposed algorithm were analyzed on well-known amino acid sequences that are used frequently in the literature. Experimental results show that the employed new mechanisms improve the efficiency of our algorithm and that the proposed algorithm is superior to other state-of-the-art algorithms. It obtained a hit ratio of 100% for sequences up to 18 monomers, within a budget of $10^{11}$ solution evaluations. New best-known solutions were obtained for most of the sequences. The existence of the symmetric best-known solutions is also demonstrated in the paper.

本文提出了一种用于蛋白质折叠优化的新型差分进化算法，该算法应用于三维AB离格模型。所提出的算法包括两个新机制。局部搜索用于提高收敛速度并降低能量计算的运行时复杂度。为此，本地搜索中引入了本地运动。设计的演化算法具有较快的收敛速度，因此，当它陷入局部最优或找到一个较好的解决方案时，很难找到更好的类似解决方案。类似的解决方案与仅有少数组件的良好解决方案不同。组件重新初始化方法旨在缓解此问题。在文献中经常使用的已知氨基酸序列上分析新机制和所提出的算法。实验结果表明，所采用的新机制提高了算法的效率，并且所提出的算法优于其他最先进的算法。在$ 10 ^ {11} $解决方案评估的预算范围内，它对多达18个单体的序列获得了100％的命中率。新的最知名的解决方案获得了大部分序列。本文还论证了对称最知名解决方案的存在。
