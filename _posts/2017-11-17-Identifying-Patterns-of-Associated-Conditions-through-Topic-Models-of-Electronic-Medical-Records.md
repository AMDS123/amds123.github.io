##### Abstract
Multiple adverse health conditions co-occurring in a patient are typically associated with poor prognosis and increased office or hospital visits. Developing methods to identify patterns of co-occurring conditions can assist in diagnosis. Thus identifying patterns of associations among co-occurring conditions is of growing interest. In this paper, we report preliminary results from a data-driven study, in which we apply a machine learning method, namely, topic modeling, to electronic medical records, aiming to identify patterns of associated conditions. Specifically, we use the well established latent dirichlet allocation, a method based on the idea that documents can be modeled as a mixture of latent topics, where each topic is a distribution over words. In our study, we adapt the LDA model to identify latent topics in patients' EMRs. We evaluate the performance of our method both qualitatively, and show that the obtained topics indeed align well with distinct medical phenomena characterized by co-occurring conditions.

患者共同发生的多种不良健康状况通常与预后不良和办公室或医院访问增加有关。开发方法来识别共现条件的模式可以帮助诊断。因此，识别共生条件之间的关联模式是越来越感兴趣。在本文中，我们报告了一个数据驱动的研究的初步结果，其中我们将机器学习方法，即主题建模，应用于电子病历，旨在识别相关条件的模式。具体而言，我们使用完善的潜在迪里克莱特分配，这种方法基于这样一种观点，即文档可以被模拟为潜在主题的混合，其中每个主题都是一个词的分布。在我们的研究中，我们调整LDA模型来识别病人EMR中的潜在话题。我们从定性的角度评估了我们的方法的性能，并且显示所获得的主题确实与以共现条件为特征的不同医学现象保持一致。
