##### Abstract
Human age estimation has attracted increasing researches due to its wide applicability in such as security monitoring and advertisement recommendation. Although a variety of methods have been proposed, most of them focus only on the age-specific facial appearance. However, biological researches have shown that not only gender but also the aging difference between the male and the female inevitably affect the age estimation. To our knowledge, so far there have been two methods that have concerned the gender factor. The first is a sequential method which first classifies the gender and then performs age estimation respectively for classified male and female. Although it promotes age estimation performance because of its consideration on the gender semantic difference, an accumulation risk of estimation errors is unavoidable. To overcome drawbacks of the sequential strategy, the second is to regress the age appended with the gender by concatenating their labels as two dimensional output using Partial Least Squares (PLS). Although leading to promotion of age estimation performance, such a concatenation not only likely confuses the semantics between the gender and age, but also ignores the aging discrepancy between the male and the female. In order to overcome their shortcomings, in this paper we propose a unified framework to perform gender-aware age estimation. The proposed method considers and utilizes not only the semantic relationship between the gender and the age, but also the aging discrepancy between the male and the female. Finally, experimental results demonstrate not only the superiority of our method in performance, but also its good interpretability in revealing the aging discrepancy.

##### Abstract (translated by Google)
由于在人身安全监测和广告推荐等方面具有广泛的适用性，人类年龄估计已经引起了越来越多的研究。虽然已经提出了多种方法，但是大多数方法只关注年龄特定的面部外观。然而，生物学研究表明，不仅性别，而且男女老龄化的差异不可避免地影响年龄的估计。就我们所知，到目前为止，有两种方法关注性别因素。首先是一个序列的方法，首先分类的性别，然后进行分类男性和女性的年龄估计。虽然由于考虑到性别语义差异而促进了年龄估计的表现，但估计误差的累积风险是不可避免的。为了克服顺序策略的缺点，第二个方法是通过使用偏最小二乘（PLS）将它们的标签串联起来作为二维输出来回归附加了性别的年龄。虽然导致年龄估计表现的提升，但这样的连接不但可能混淆了性别与年龄之间的语义关系，而且也忽略了男女之间的老龄化差异。为了克服它们的缺点，本文提出了一个统一的框架来进行性别意识的年龄估计。所提出的方法不仅考虑和利用了性别与年龄之间的语义关系，还考虑到了男女之间的年龄差异。最后，实验结果不仅证明了我们的方法在性能上的优越性，而且在揭示时效偏差方面具有良好的解释能力。
