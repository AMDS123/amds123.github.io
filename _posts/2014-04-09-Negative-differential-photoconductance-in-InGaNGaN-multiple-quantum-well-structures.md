##### Abstract
The photocurrent and the small-signal photoconductance of InGaN/GaN multiple-quantum-well structures were studied at the temperature range from 10 to 300 K. The optical excitation was carried out at the quantum wells intrinsic absorption wavelengths. Regardless of the temperature the experimental plots of direct photocurrent vs. reverse voltage were step-like, which is related to the sequential quantum wells passage from quasi-neutrality into the p-n-junction space charge region. In addition, under optical excitation near the quantum wells material absorption edge we observed the photocurrent declines with increasing reverse bias, i.e. the negative differential photoconductance. This phenomenon is associated with a blue shift of the InGaN quantum well absorption edge arising due to compensation of its build-in piezoelectric field by the p-n-junction electric field. Furthermore, it was experimentally shown that each quantum well corresponds to two peaks in the small-signal photoconductance vs. reverse voltage dependence. The temperature changes in the amplitude and position of these peaks indicate that they probably related to the charge carriers thermal emission and thermally activated tunneling from the quantum well.

在10〜300K的温度范围内研究了InGaN / GaN多量子阱结构的光电流和小信号光电导。光激发在量子阱固有吸收波长处进行。不管温度如何，直接光电流对反向电压的实验曲线都是阶梯状的，这与连续的量子阱从准中性到准p-n结空间电荷区的通道有关。另外，在量子阱材料吸收边缘附近的光激发下，我们观察到光电流随反向偏压增加而减小，即负微分光电导。这种现象与InGaN量子阱吸收边缘的蓝移有关，由于其内建压电场被p-n结电场补偿。此外，实验表明，每个量子阱对应于小信号光电导对反向电压依赖性中的两个峰值。这些峰的幅度和位置的温度变化表明它们可能与量子阱中的电荷载流子热发射和热激活隧道效应有关。
