##### Abstract
The photocurrent and the small-signal photoconductance of InGaN/GaN multiple-quantum-well structures were studied at the temperature range from 10 to 300 K. The optical excitation was carried out at the quantum wells intrinsic absorption wavelengths. Regardless of the temperature the experimental plots of direct photocurrent vs. reverse voltage were step-like, which is related to the sequential quantum wells passage from quasi-neutrality into the p-n-junction space charge region. In addition, under optical excitation near the quantum wells material absorption edge we observed the photocurrent declines with increasing reverse bias, i.e. the negative differential photoconductance. This phenomenon is associated with a blue shift of the InGaN quantum well absorption edge arising due to compensation of its build-in piezoelectric field by the p-n-junction electric field. Furthermore, it was experimentally shown that each quantum well corresponds to two peaks in the small-signal photoconductance vs. reverse voltage dependence. The temperature changes in the amplitude and position of these peaks indicate that they probably related to the charge carriers thermal emission and thermally activated tunneling from the quantum well.
