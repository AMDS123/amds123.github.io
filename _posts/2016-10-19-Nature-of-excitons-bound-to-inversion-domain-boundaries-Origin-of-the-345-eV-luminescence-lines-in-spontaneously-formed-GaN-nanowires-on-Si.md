##### Abstract
We investigate the 3.45-eV luminescence band of spontaneously formed GaN nanowires on Si(111) by photoluminescence and cathodoluminescence spectroscopy. This band is found to be particularly prominent for samples synthesized at comparatively low temperatures. At the same time, these samples exhibit a peculiar morphology, namely, isolated long nanowires are interspersed within a dense matrix of short ones. Cathodoluminescence intensity maps reveal the 3.45-eV band to originate primarily from the long nanowires. Transmission electron microscopy shows that these long nanowires are either Ga polar and are joined by an inversion domain boundary with their short N-polar neighbors, or exhibit a Ga-polar core surrounded by a N-polar shell with a tubular inversion domain boundary at the core/shell interface. For samples grown at high temperatures, which exhibit a uniform nanowire morphology, the 3.45-eV band is also found to originate from particular nanowires in the ensemble and thus presumably from inversion domain boundaries stemming from the coexistence of N- and Ga-polar nanowires. For several of the investigated samples, the 3.45-eV band splits into a doublet. We demonstrate that the higher-energy component of this doublet arises from the recombination of two-dimensional excitons free to move in the plane of the inversion domain boundary. In contrast, the lower-energy component of the doublet originates from excitons localized in the plane of the inversion domain boundary. We propose that this in-plane localization is due to shallow donors in the vicinity of the inversion domain boundaries.

我们通过光致发光和阴极发光光谱研究Si（111）上自发形成的GaN纳米线的3.45eV发光带。对于在较低温度下合成的样品来说，发现这个谱带特别突出。同时，这些样品表现出独特的形态，即孤立的长纳米线散布在短的密集基质中。阴极发光强度图显示主要来源于长纳米线的3.45电子伏特带。透射电子显微镜显示，这些长纳米线或者是Ga极性的，并且通过反向畴边界与它们的短N极邻居相连，或者表现出由N极壳围绕的Ga极核，其中管状反转畴边界位于核心/外壳接口。对于在高温下生长的具有均匀纳米线形态的样品，还发现3.45电子伏特带来源于集合中的特定纳米线，并且因此推测来自源自N-和Ga-极性纳米线共存的反型区域边界。对于几个被调查的样品，3.45电子伏带分裂成双峰。我们证明了这种双能级的更高能量分量来自于二维激子自由地在反演区域边界的平面内移动的重组。相反，二重态的较低能量分量来源于位于反演区边界平面内的激子。我们提出，这种面内定位是由于在反演域边界附近的浅层施主。
