##### Abstract
Melanoma is one of the ten most common cancers in the US. Early detection is crucial for survival, but often the cancer is diagnosed in the fatal stage. Deep learning has the potential to improve cancer detection rates, but its applicability to melanoma detection is compromised by the limitations of the available skin lesion databases, which are small, heavily imbalanced, and contain images with occlusions. We propose a complete deep learning system for lesion segmentation and classification that utilizes networks specialized in data purification and augmentation. It contains the processing unit for removing image occlusions and the data generation unit for populating scarce lesion classes, or equivalently creating virtual patients with pre-defined types of lesions. We empirically verify our approach and show superior performance over common baselines.
