##### Abstract
In this project, a rather complete proof-theoretical formalization of Lambek Calculus (non-associative with arbitrary extensions) has been ported from Coq proof assistent to HOL4 theorem prover, with some improvements and new theorems. Three deduction systems (Syntactic Calculus, Natural Deduction and Sequent Calculus) of Lambek Calculus are defined with many related theorems proved. The equivalance between these systems are formally proved. Finally, a formalization of Sequent Calculus proofs (where Coq has built-in supports) has been designed and implemented in HOL4. Some basic results including the sub-formula properties of the so-called "cut-free" proofs are formally proved. This work can be considered as the preliminary work towards a language parser based on category grammars which is not multimodal but still has ability to support context-sensitive languages through customized extensions.

在这个项目中，Lambek演算的一个比较完整的证明 - 理论形式化（与任意扩展的非关联）已经从Coq证明移植到HOL4定理证明，并且有了一些改进和新的定理。定义了Lambek微积分的三个演绎系统（句法演算，自然演绎和连续微积分），证明了许多相关的定理。这些系统之间的等价性正式证明了。最后，在HOL4中设计和实现了Sequent Calculus证明（Coq内置支持）的形式化。一些基本的结果，包括所谓的“免剪”证明的子公式性质，得到了正式的证明。这项工作可以被认为是基于类别语法的语言分析器的初步工作，它不是多模式的，但仍然能够通过自定义的扩展来支持上下文敏感的语言。
