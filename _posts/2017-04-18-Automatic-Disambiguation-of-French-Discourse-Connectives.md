##### Abstract
Discourse connectives (e.g. however, because) are terms that can explicitly convey a discourse relation within a text. While discourse connectives have been shown to be an effective clue to automatically identify discourse relations, they are not always used to convey such relations, thus they should first be disambiguated between discourse-usage non-discourse-usage. In this paper, we investigate the applicability of features proposed for the disambiguation of English discourse connectives for French. Our results with the French Discourse Treebank (FDTB) show that syntactic and lexical features developed for English texts are as effective for French and allow the disambiguation of French discourse connectives with an accuracy of 94.2%.

话语连接词（然而，因为）是可以在文本中明确传达话语关系的词语。虽然话语连接词已经被证明是自动识别话语关系的有效线索，但并不总是用来表达这种关系，因此首先应该在话语使用非话语使用之间进行消歧。在本文中，我们研究了用于法语的英语话语连词消歧的特征的适用性。我们与法语语篇树库（FDTB）的结果表明，为英语文本而开发的句法和词汇特征对法语有效，并允许法语语篇连词的消歧，准确率为94.2％。
