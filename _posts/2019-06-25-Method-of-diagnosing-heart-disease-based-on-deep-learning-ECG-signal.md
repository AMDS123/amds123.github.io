##### Abstract
The traditional method of diagnosing heart disease on ECG signal is artificial observation. Some have tried to combine expertise and signal processing to classify ECG signal by heart disease type. However, the currency is not so sufficient that it can be used in medical applications. We develop an algorithm that combines signal processing and deep learning to classify ECG signals into Normal AF other rhythm and noise, which help us solve this problem. It is demonstrated that we can obtain the time-frequency diagram of ECG signal by wavelet transform, and use DNN to classify the time-frequency diagram to find out the heart disease that the signal collector may have. Overall, an accuracy of 94 percent is achieved on the validation set. According to the evaluation criteria of PhysioNet/Computing in Cardiology (CinC) in 2017, the F1 score of this method is 0.957, which is higher than the first place in the competition in 2017.
