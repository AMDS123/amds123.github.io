##### Abstract
As most users do not precisely know the structure and/or the content of databases, their queries do not exactly reflect their information needs. The database management systems (DBMS) may interact with users and use their feedback on the returned results to learn the information needs behind their queries. Current query interfaces assume that users do not learn and modify the way way they express their information needs in form of queries during their interaction with the DBMS. Using a real-world interaction workload, we show that users learn and modify how to express their information needs during their interactions with the DBMS and their learning is accurately modeled by a well-known reinforcement learning mechanism. As current data interaction systems assume that users do not modify their strategies, they cannot discover the information needs behind users' queries effectively. We model the interaction between users and DBMS as a game with identical interest between two rational agents whose goal is to establish a common language for representing information needs in form of queries. We propose a reinforcement learning method that learns and answers the information needs behind queries and adapts to the changes in users' strategies and prove that it improves the effectiveness of answering queries stochastically speaking. We propose two efficient implementation of this method over large relational databases. Our extensive empirical studies over real-world query workloads indicate that our algorithms are efficient and effective.

由于大多数用户并不完全了解数据库的结构和/或内容，他们的查询并不完全反映他们的信息需求。数据库管理系统（DBMS）可以与用户交互，并利用他们对返回结果的反馈来了解他们查询后面的信息需求。当前的查询接口假定用户在与DBMS交互期间不会以查询的形式学习和修改他们表达信息需求的方式。使用真实世界的交互工作负载，我们展示用户学习和修改如何在与DBMS交互期间表达他们的信息需求，并且他们的学习通过众所周知的强化学习机制精确地建模。由于当前的数据交互系统假定用户不修改他们的策略，他们无法有效地发现用户查询背后的信息需求。我们将用户和数据库管理系统之间的交互作为两个理性代理之间具有相同兴趣的游戏建模，其目标是建立以查询形式表示信息需求的通用语言。我们提出了一种强化学习方法，它学习和回答查询后面的信息需求，并适应用户策略的变化，并证明它提高了随机地回答查询的有效性。我们提出了在大型关系数据库上实现这种方法的两种有效方法。我们对实际查询工作量的广泛的实证研究表明，我们的算法是高效且有效的。
