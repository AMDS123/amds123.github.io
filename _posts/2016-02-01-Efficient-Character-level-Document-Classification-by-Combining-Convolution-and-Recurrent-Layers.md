##### Abstract
Document classification tasks were primarily tackled at word level. Recent research that works with character-level inputs shows several benefits over word-level approaches such as natural incorporation of morphemes and better handling of rare words. We propose a neural network architecture that utilizes both convolution and recurrent layers to efficiently encode character inputs. We validate the proposed model on eight large scale document classification tasks and compare with character-level convolution-only models. It achieves comparable performances with much less parameters.

文件分类任务主要是在文字层面处理的。最近与字符级输入相关的研究表明，与单词级别的方法相比，例如自然并入语素和更好地处理罕见单词有好处。我们提出了一个神经网络架构，利用卷积和复发层有效地编码字符输入。我们在八个大规模的文档分类任务上验证所提出的模型，并与字符级卷积模型进行比较。它以较少的参数实现了可比较的性能。
