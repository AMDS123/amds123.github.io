##### Abstract
Previous studies by our group have shown that three-dimensional high-frequency quantitative ultrasound methods have the potential to differentiate metastatic lymph nodes from cancer-free lymph nodes dissected from human cancer patients. To successfully perform these methods inside the lymph node parenchyma, an automatic segmentation method is highly desired to exclude the surrounding thin layer of fat from quantitative ultrasound processing and accurately correct for ultrasound attenuation. In high-frequency ultrasound images of lymph nodes, the intensity distribution of lymph node parenchyma and fat varies spatially because of acoustic attenuation and focusing effects. Thus, the intensity contrast between two object regions (e.g., lymph node parenchyma and fat) is also spatially varying. In our previous work, nested graph cut demonstrated its ability to simultaneously segment lymph node parenchyma, fat, and the outer phosphate-buffered saline bath even when some boundaries are lost because of acoustic attenuation and focusing effects. This paper describes a novel approach called graph cut with locally adaptive energy to further deal with spatially varying distributions of lymph node parenchyma and fat caused by inhomogeneous acoustic attenuation. The proposed method achieved Dice similarity coefficients of 0.937+-0.035 when compared to expert manual segmentation on a representative dataset consisting of 115 three-dimensional lymph node images obtained from colorectal cancer patients.

我们以前的研究表明，三维高频定量超声波方法有可能区分转移性淋巴结与人类癌症患者解剖的无癌淋巴结。为了在淋巴结实质内成功实施这些方法，非常希望采用自动分割方法从定量超声波处理中排除周围的脂肪薄层，并精确校正超声衰减。在淋巴结的高频超声图像中，由于声衰减和聚焦效应，淋巴结实质和脂肪的强度分布在空间上变化。因此，两个目标区域（例如，淋巴结实质和脂肪）之间的强度对比也是空间变化的。在我们以前的工作中，嵌套图切割表明，即使在由于声衰减和聚焦效应而丧失一些边界的情况下，它也能够同时分割淋巴结实质，脂肪和外部磷酸盐缓冲盐水浴。本文介绍了一种新的方法称为图形切割与局部自适应能量进一步处理不均匀声衰减引起的淋巴结实质和脂肪的空间变化分布。所提出的方法与由专业手动分割的代表性数据集（由115个从结肠直肠癌患者获得的三维淋巴结图像）相比，实现了Dice相似系数0.937±0.035。
