##### Abstract
Language is an extremely interesting subject to study, each day presenting new challenges and new topics for research. Words in particular have several unique characteristics which when explored, prove to be astonishing. Anagrams and Antigrams are such words possessing these amazing properties. The presented work is an exploration into generating anagrams from a given word and determining whether there exists antigram relationships between the pairs of generated anagrams in light of the Word2Vec distributional semantic similarity model. The experiments conducted, showed promising results for detecting antigrams.
