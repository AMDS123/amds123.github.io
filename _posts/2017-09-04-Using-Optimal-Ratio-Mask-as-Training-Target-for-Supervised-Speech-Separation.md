##### Abstract
Supervised speech separation uses supervised learning algorithms to learn a mapping from an input noisy signal to an output target. With the fast development of deep learning, supervised separation has become the most important direction in speech separation area in recent years. For the supervised algorithm, training target has a significant impact on the performance. Ideal ratio mask is a commonly used training target, which can improve the speech intelligibility and quality of the separated speech. However, it does not take into account the correlation between noise and clean speech. In this paper, we use the optimal ratio mask as the training target of the deep neural network (DNN) for speech separation. The experiments are carried out under various noise environments and signal to noise ratio (SNR) conditions. The results show that the optimal ratio mask outperforms other training targets in general.

监督语音分离使用监督学习算法来学习从输入噪声信号到输出目标的映射。随着深度学习的快速发展，监督分离已成为近年来语音分离领域最重要的方向。对于监督算法，训练目标对性能有显着的影响。理想比例掩模是一种常用的训练目标，可以提高分离语音的语音清晰度和质量。但是，它并没有考虑到噪音和干净的言语之间的相关性。在本文中，我们使用最佳比例掩模作为深度神经网络（DNN）的语音分离的训练目标。实验在各种噪声环境和信噪比（SNR）条件下进行。结果表明，最优比例掩模总体上优于其他训练目标。
