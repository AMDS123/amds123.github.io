##### Abstract
The exploration of social conversations for addressing patient's needs is an important analytical task in which many scholarly publications are contributing to fill the knowledge gap in this area. The main difficulty remains the inability to turn such contributions into pragmatic processes the pharmaceutical industry can leverage in order to generate insight from social media data, which can be considered as one of the most challenging source of information available today due to its sheer volume and noise. This study is based on the work by Scott Spangler and Jeffrey Kreulen and applies it to identify structure in social media through the extraction of a topical taxonomy able to capture the latent knowledge in social conversations in health-related sites. The mechanism for automatically identifying and generating a taxonomy from social conversations is developed and pressured tested using public data from media sites focused on the needs of cancer patients and their families. Moreover, a novel method for generating the category's label and the determination of an optimal number of categories is presented which extends Scott and Jeffrey's research in a meaningful way. We assume the reader is familiar with taxonomies, what they are and how they are used.

##### Abstract (translated by Google)
探讨解决病人需求的社会对话是一项重要的分析任务，许多学术刊物正在帮助填补这方面的知识空白。主要困难仍然是无法将这种贡献转化为制药业可以利用的实用程序，以便从社交媒体数据中获得洞察力，由于其庞大的数量和噪音，可被认为是当今最具挑战性的信息来源之一。本研究基于Scott Spangler和Jeffrey Kreulen的工作，并通过提取能够捕捉与健康有关的网站中的社交对话中的潜在知识的主题分类学来识别社交媒体中的结构。从社交对话中自动识别和生成分类标准的机制是通过使用来自媒体站点的公共数据，专注于癌症患者及其家属的需求来开发并进行压力测试。此外，还提出了一种用于生成类别标签的新方法，并确定了最佳类别的数目，从而有效地扩展了Scott和Jeffrey的研究。我们假设读者熟悉分类法，它们是什么以及如何使用它们。
