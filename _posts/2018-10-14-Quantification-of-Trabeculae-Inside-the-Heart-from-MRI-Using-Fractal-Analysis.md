##### Abstract
Left ventricular non-compaction (LVNC) is a rare cardiomyopathy (CMP) that should be considered as a possible diagnosis because of its potential complications which are heart failure, ventricular arrhythmias, and embolic events. For analysis cardiac functionality, extracting information from the Left ventricular (LV) is already a broad field of Medical Imaging. Different algorithms and strategies ranging that is semiautomated or automated has already been developed to get useful information from such a critical structure of heart. Trabeculae in the heart undergoes difference changes like solid from spongy. Due to failure of this process left ventricle non-compaction occurred. In this project, we will demonstrate the fractal dimension (FD) and manual segmentation of the Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) of the heart that quantify amount of trabeculae inside the heart. The greater the value of fractal dimension inside the heart indicates the greater complex pattern of the trabeculae in the heart.
