##### Abstract
In the past few years, the area of Machine Learning (ML) has witnessed tremendous advancements, becoming a pervasive technology in a wide range of applications. One area that can significantly benefit from the use of ML is Combinatorial Optimization. The three pillars of constraint satisfaction and optimization problem solving, i.e., modeling, search, and optimization, can exploit ML techniques to boost their accuracy, efficiency and effectiveness. In this survey we focus on the modeling component, whose effectiveness is crucial for solving the problem. The modeling activity has been traditionally shaped by optimization and domain experts, interacting to provide realistic results. Machine Learning techniques can tremendously ease the process, and exploit the available data to either create models or refine expert-designed ones. In this survey we cover approaches that have been recently proposed to enhance the modeling process by learning either single constraints, objective functions, or the whole model. We highlight common themes to multiple approaches and draw connections with related fields of research.

在过去几年中，机器学习（ML）领域取得了巨大的进步，成为广泛应用中的普遍技术。可以从使用ML中获益的一个领域是组合优化。约束满足和优化问题求解的三个支柱，即建模，搜索和优化，可以利用ML技术来提高其准确性，效率和有效性。在本次调查中，我们关注的是建模组件，其有效性对于解决问题至关重要。建模活动传统上由优化和领域专家塑造，相互作用以提供逼真的结果。机器学习技术可以极大地简化流程，并利用可用数据创建模型或改进专家设计的模型。在本次调查中，我们将介绍最近提出的方法，通过学习单个约束，目标函数或整个模型来增强建模过程。我们强调多种方法的共同主题，并与相关研究领域建立联系。
