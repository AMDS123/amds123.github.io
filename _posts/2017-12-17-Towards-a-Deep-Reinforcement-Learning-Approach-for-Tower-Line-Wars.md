##### Abstract
There have been numerous breakthroughs with reinforcement learning in the recent years, perhaps most notably on Deep Reinforcement Learning successfully playing and winning relatively advanced computer games. There is undoubtedly an anticipation that Deep Reinforcement Learning will play a major role when the first AI masters the complicated game plays needed to beat a professional Real-Time Strategy game player. For this to be possible, there needs to be a game environment that targets and fosters AI research, and specifically Deep Reinforcement Learning. Some game environments already exist, however, these are either overly simplistic such as Atari 2600 or complex such as Starcraft II from Blizzard Entertainment. We propose a game environment in between Atari 2600 and Starcraft II, particularly targeting Deep Reinforcement Learning algorithm research. The environment is a variant of Tower Line Wars from Warcraft III, Blizzard Entertainment. Further, as a proof of concept that the environment can harbor Deep Reinforcement algorithms, we propose and apply a Deep Q-Reinforcement architecture. The architecture simplifies the state space so that it is applicable to Q-learning, and in turn improves performance compared to current state-of-the-art methods. Our experiments show that the proposed architecture can learn to play the environment well, and score 33% better than standard Deep Q-learning which in turn proves the usefulness of the game environment.

近年来强化学习方面已经有了很多突破，尤其是在深度强化学习方面，成功玩起了相当先进的电脑游戏。毫无疑问，当第一人工智能掌握打败专业实时战略游戏玩家所需的复杂游戏时，深度强化学习将扮演重要角色。为了这个可能，需要有一个针对和促进人工智能研究的游戏环境，特别是深度强化学习。一些游戏环境已经存在，但是这些要么过于简单化，比如Atari 2600或者像暴雪娱乐公司的“星际争霸II”那样复杂。我们在Atari 2600和Starcraft II之间提出了一个游戏环境，特别是针对Deep Reinforcement Learning算法的研究。环境是魔兽争霸III，暴雪娱乐的塔线战争的变种。此外，作为环境可以包含Deep Reinforcement算法的概念证明，我们提出并应用Deep Q-Reinforcement架构。该架构简化了状态空间，使其适用于Q学习，反过来提高性能相比，目前最先进的方法。我们的实验表明，所提出的架构可以学习到更好地发挥环境，比标准深度Q学习好33％，这反过来证明了游戏环境的有用性。
