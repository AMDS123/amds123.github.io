##### Abstract
Sound frisson is a subjective experience wherein people tend to perceive the feeling of chills in addition to a physiological response, such as goosebumps. Multiple examples of frisson inducing sounds have been reported in the large online community, but the mechanism of sound frisson is still elusive. Typical frisson inducing sounds contain a looming effect, in which a sound seems to be approaching close to one's peripersonal space. Previous studies on sound in peripersonal space have reported objective measurements of sound-inducing effects, but few studies have investigated the subjective experience of frisson-inducing sound. Here, we investigate whether sound stimulus moving around the human head can also produce subjective ratings of frisson. Our results show that the participants experienced sound-induced frisson when auditory stimuli were rotated around the head, regardless of the sound sources.
