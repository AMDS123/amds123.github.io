##### Abstract
Representing a scanned map of the real environment as a topological structure is an important research in robotics. %is currently an important research. Since topological representations of maps save a huge amount of map storage space and online computing time, they are widely used in fields such as path planning, map matching, and semantic mapping. We propose a novel topological map representation, the Area Graph, in which the vertices represent areas and edges represent passages. The Area Graph is developed from a pruned Voronoi Graph, the Topology Graph. The paper also presents path planning as one application for the Area Graph. For that, we derive a so-called Passage Graph from the Area Graph. Because our algorithm segments the map as a set of areas, the first experiment compares the results of the Area Graph with that of state-of-the-art segmentation approaches, which proved that our method effectively prevented over-segmentation. Then the second experiment shows the superiority of our method over the traditional A* planning algorithm.
