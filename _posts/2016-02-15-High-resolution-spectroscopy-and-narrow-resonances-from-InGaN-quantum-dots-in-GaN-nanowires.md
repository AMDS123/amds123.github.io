##### Abstract
High resolution coherent nonlinear optical spectroscopy of an ensemble of red-emitting InGaN quantum dots in GaN nanowires is reported. The data show a pronounced atom-like interaction between resonant laser fields and quantum dot excitons at low temperature that is difficult to observe in the linear absorption spectrum due to inhomogeneous broadening from indium fluctuation effects. We find that the nonlinear signal persists strongly at room temperature. The robust atom-like room temperature response indicates the possibility that this material could serve as the platform for proposed excitonic based applications without the need of cryogenics.
