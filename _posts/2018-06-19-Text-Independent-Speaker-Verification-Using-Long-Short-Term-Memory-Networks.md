##### Abstract
In this paper, an architecture based on Long Short-Term Memory Networks has been proposed for the text-independent scenario which is aimed to capture the temporal speaker-related information by operating over traditional speech features. For speaker verification, at first, a background model must be created for speaker representation. Then, in enrollment stage, the speaker models will be created based on the enrollment utterances. For this work, the model will be trained in an end-to-end fashion to combine the first two stages. The main goal of end-to-end training is the model being optimized to be consistent with the speaker verification protocol. The end- to-end training jointly learns the background and speaker models by creating the representation space. The LSTM architecture is trained to create a discrimination space for validating the match and non-match pairs for speaker verification. The proposed architecture demonstrate its superiority in the text-independent compared to other traditional methods.

在本文中，已经提出了基于长短期存储器网络的架构用于与文本无关的场景，其旨在通过对传统语音特征进行操作来捕获与时间说话者相关的信息。对于说话者验证，首先，必须为说话者表示创建背景模型。然后，在登记阶段，将基于登记发言创建说话者模型。对于这项工作，模型将以端到端的方式进行培训，以结合前两个阶段。端到端培训的主要目标是优化模型以与扬声器验证协议保持一致。端到端培训通过创建表示空间共同学习背景和演讲者模型。训练LSTM架构以创建用于验证用于说话者验证的匹配和非匹配对的辨别空间。与其他传统方法相比，所提出的架构证明了其在文本无关中的优越性。
