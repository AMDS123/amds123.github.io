##### Abstract
In this study, we propose a novel graph neural network, called propagate-selector (PS), which propagates information over sentences to understand information that cannot be inferred when considering sentences in isolation. First, we design a graph structure in which each node represents the individual sentences, and some pairs of nodes are selectively connected based on the text structure. Then, we develop an iterative attentive aggregation, and a skip-combine method in which a node interacts with its neighborhood nodes to accumulate the necessary information. To evaluate the performance of the proposed approaches, we conducted experiments with the HotpotQA dataset. The empirical results demonstrate the superiority of our proposed approach, which obtains the best performances compared to the widely used answer-selection models that do not consider the inter-sentential relationship.
