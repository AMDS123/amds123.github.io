##### Abstract
Decision making often requires information that must be Provided with the rich data format. Addressing these new requirements appropriately makes it necessary for government agencies to orchestrate large amounts of information from different sources and formats, to be efficiently delivered through the devices commonly used by people, such as computers, netbooks, tablets and smartphones. To overcome these problems, a model is proposed for the conceptual representation of the State's organizational units, seen as georeferenced entities of Electronic Government, based on ontologies designed under the principles of Linked Open Data, which allows the automatic extraction of information through the machines, which supports the process of governmental decision making and gives citizens full access to find and process through mobile technologies.
