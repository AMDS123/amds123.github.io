##### Abstract
The analysis of the collaborative learning process is one of the growing fields of education research, which has many different analytic solutions. In this paper, we provided a new solution to improve automated collaborative learning analyses using deep neural networks. Instead of using self-reported questionnaires, which are subject to bias and noise, we automatically extract group-working information by object recognition results using Mask R-CNN method. This process is based on detecting the people and other objects from pictures and video clips of the collaborative learning process, then evaluate the mobile learning performance using the collaborative indicators. We tested our approach to automatically evaluate the group-work collaboration in a controlled study of thirty-three dyads while performing an anatomy body painting intervention. The results indicate that our approach recognizes the differences of collaborations among teams of treatment and control groups in the case study. This work introduces new methods for automated quality prediction of collaborations among human-human interactions using computer vision techniques.
