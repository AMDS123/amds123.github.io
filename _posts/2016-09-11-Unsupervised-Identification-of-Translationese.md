##### Abstract
Translated texts are distinctively different from original ones, to the extent that supervised text classification methods can distinguish between them with high accuracy. These differences were proven useful for statistical machine translation. However, it has been suggested that the accuracy of translation detection deteriorates when the classifier is evaluated outside the domain it was trained on. We show that this is indeed the case, in a variety of evaluation scenarios. We then show that unsupervised classification is highly accurate on this task. We suggest a method for determining the correct labels of the clustering outcomes, and then use the labels for voting, improving the accuracy even further. Moreover, we suggest a simple method for clustering in the challenging case of mixed-domain datasets, in spite of the dominance of domain-related features over translation-related ones. The result is an effective, fully-unsupervised method for distinguishing between original and translated texts that can be applied to new domains with reasonable accuracy.

翻译后的文本与原始文本有明显区别，监督文本分类方法能够高精度地区分它们。这些差异被证明对于统计机器翻译是有用的。然而，已经提出，当分类器在其被训练的领域之外被评估时，翻译检测的准确性恶化。我们证明这确实是这样，在各种评估情况下。然后我们表明，无监督分类在这个任务上是非常准确的。我们建议一种确定聚类结果正确标签的方法，然后使用标签进行投票，进一步提高准确性。此外，我们建议在混合域数据集的挑战性情况下，一个简单的聚类方法，尽管与域相关的特征优于翻译相关的特征。其结果是一个有效的，完全无监督的方法来区分原文和翻译文本，可以适当的准确性应用于新的领域。
