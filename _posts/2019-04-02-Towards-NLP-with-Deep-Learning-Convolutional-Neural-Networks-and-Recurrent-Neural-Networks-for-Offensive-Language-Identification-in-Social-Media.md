##### Abstract
This short paper presents the design decisions taken and challenges encountered in completing SemEval Task 6, which poses the problem of identifying and categorizing offensive language in tweets. Our proposed solutions explore Deep Learning techniques, Linear Support Vector classification and Random Forests to identify offensive tweets, to classify offenses as targeted or untargeted and eventually to identify the target subject type.
