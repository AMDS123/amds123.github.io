##### Abstract
Active contour models based on partial differential equations have proved successful in image segmentation, yet the study of their geometric formulation on arbitrary geometric graphs is still at an early stage. In this paper, we introduce geometric approximations of gradient and curvature, which are used in the geodesic active contour model. We prove convergence in probability of our gradient approximation to the true gradient value and derive an asymptotic upper bound for the error of this approximation for the class of random geometric graphs. Two different approaches for the approximation of curvature are presented and both are also proved to converge in probability in the case of random geometric graphs. We propose neighborhood-based filtering on graphs to improve the accuracy of the aforementioned approximations and define two variants of Gaussian smoothing on graphs which include normalization in order to adapt to graph non-uniformities. The performance of our active contour framework on graphs is demonstrated in the segmentation of regular images and geographical data defined on arbitrary graphs.

基于偏微分方程的主动轮廓模型在图像分割中被证明是成功的，而在任意几何图形上的几何公式​​的研究还处于起步阶段。在本文中，我们引入梯度和曲率的几何逼近，它们被用在测地线活动轮廓模型中。我们证明了梯度近似的真实概率收敛于真实的梯度值，并推导出随机几何图类的这种近似的误差的渐近上界。给出了两种不同的曲率近似方法，并且在随机几何图的情况下，两种方法都被证明在概率上收敛。我们在图上提出了基于邻域的滤波来提高上述近似的准确性，并在包含规范化的图上定义了高斯平滑的两种变体，以适应图不均匀性。在任意图上定义的规则图像和地理数据的分割中展示了我们的活动轮廓框架在图上的表现。
