##### Abstract
Automatic image segmentation becomes very crucial for tumor detection in medical image processing.In general, manual and semi automatic segmentation techniques require more time and knowledge. However these drawbacks had overcome by automatic segmentation still there needs to develop more appropriate techniques for medical image segmentation. Therefore, we proposed hybrid approach based image segmentation using the combined features of region growing and threshold based segmentation techniques. It is followed by pre-processing stage to provide an accurate brain tumor extraction by the help of Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). If the tumor has holes, the region growing segmentation algorithm cannot reveal but the proposed hybrid segmentation technique can be achieved and the result as well improved. Hence the result used to made assessment with the various performance measures as DICE, JACCARD similarity, accuracy, sensitivity and specificity. These similarity measures have been extensively used for evaluation with the ground truth of each processed image and its results are compared and analyzed.

自动图像分割对于医学图像处理中的肿瘤检测非常重要。一般来说，手动和半自动分割技术需要更多的时间和知识。然而，这些缺点已通过自动分割克服，仍然需要开发更合适的用于医学图像分割的技术。因此，我们提出了基于区域增长和基于阈值的分割技术相结合的基于混合方法的图像分割。随后是预处理阶段，借助磁共振成像（MRI）提供准确的脑肿瘤提取。如果肿瘤存在漏洞，则区域扩大分割算法不能揭示，但可以实现所提出的混合分割技术，并且结果得到改善。因此，用DICE，JACCARD相似性，准确性，敏感性和特异性等各种性能指标进行评估。这些相似性度量已广泛用于评估每幅处理过的图像的基本事实，并对其结果进行比较和分析。
