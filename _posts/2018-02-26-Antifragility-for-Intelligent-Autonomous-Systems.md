##### Abstract
Antifragile systems grow measurably better in the presence of hazards. This is in contrast to fragile systems which break down in the presence of hazards, robust systems that tolerate hazards up to a certain degree, and resilient systems that -- like self-healing systems -- revert to their earlier expected behavior after a period of convalescence. The notion of antifragility was introduced by Taleb for economics systems, but its applicability has been illustrated in biological and engineering domains as well. In this paper, we propose an architecture that imparts antifragility to intelligent autonomous systems, specifically those that are goal-driven and based on AI-planning. We argue that this architecture allows the system to self-improve by uncovering new capabilities obtained either through the hazards themselves (opportunistic) or through deliberation (strategic). An AI planning-based case study of an autonomous wheeled robot is presented. We show that with the proposed architecture, the robot develops antifragile behaviour with respect to an oil spill hazard.

在存在危险的情况下，防雾系统可以显着提高。这与脆弱的系统在存在危险时分解，在一定程度上容忍风险的健壮系统以及像自我修复系统一样的弹性系统在一段时间之后恢复到其早期的预期行为相反恢复期。 Taleb在经济学系统中引入了抗脆弱性的概念，但其适用性也在生物和工程领域得到了阐述。在本文中，我们提出了一种为智能自治系统赋予抗脆弱性的体系结构，特别是那些目标驱动并基于AI规划的体系结构。我们认为，这种架构允许系统通过发现通过危险本身（机会主义）或通过审议（战略）获得的新能力来自我提高。介绍了一个自动轮式机器人的基于AI规划的案例研究。我们表明，与建议的架构，机器人开发的石油泄漏危险的抗脆弱行为。
