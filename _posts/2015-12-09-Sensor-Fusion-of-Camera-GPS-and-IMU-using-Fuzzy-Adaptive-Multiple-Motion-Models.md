##### Abstract
A tracking system that will be used for Augmented Reality (AR) applications has two main requirements: accuracy and frame rate. The first requirement is related to the performance of the pose estimation algorithm and how accurately the tracking system can find the position and orientation of the user in the environment. Accuracy problems of current tracking devices, considering that they are low-cost devices, cause static errors during this motion estimation process. The second requirement is related to dynamic errors (the end-to-end system delay; occurring because of the delay in estimating the motion of the user and displaying images based on this estimate. This paper investigates combining the vision-based estimates with measurements from other sensors, GPS and IMU, in order to improve the tracking accuracy in outdoor environments. The idea of using Fuzzy Adaptive Multiple Models (FAMM) was investigated using a novel fuzzy rule-based approach to decide on the model that results in improved accuracy and faster convergence for the fusion filter. Results show that the developed tracking system is more accurate than a conventional GPS-IMU fusion approach due to additional estimates from a camera and fuzzy motion models. The paper also presents an application in cultural heritage context.

将用于增强现实（AR）应用的跟踪系统有两个主要要求：准确度和帧率。第一个要求与姿势估计算法的性能有关，跟踪系统能够精确地找到用户在环境中的位置和方向。当前跟踪设备的精度问题，考虑到它们是低成本设备，在运动估计过程中会导致静态错误。第二个要求是关于动态误差（端到端的系统延迟，是由于延迟估计用户的运动和基于这个估计来显示图像而发生的）。本文研究了基于视觉的估计与其他传感器，GPS和IMU，以提高室外环境下的跟踪精度;采用模糊自适应多模型（FAMM）的思想，采用一种新的基于模糊规则的方法来确定导致精度提高的模型;融合滤波器的收敛速度更快，结果表明，由于摄像机和模糊运动模型的附加估计，所开发的跟踪系统比传统的GPS-IMU融合方法更精确，并且在文化遗产背景下也有应用。
