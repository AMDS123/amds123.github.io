##### Abstract
An ML-based system for interactive labeling of image datasets is contributed in TensorBoard Projector to speed up image annotation performed by humans. The tool visualizes feature spaces and makes it directly editable by online integration of applied labels, and it is a system for verifying and managing machine learning data pertaining to labels. We propose realistic annotation emulation to evaluate the system design of interactive active learning, based on our improved semi-supervised extension of t-SNE dimensionality reduction. Our active learning tool can significantly increase labeling efficiency compared to uncertainty sampling, and we show that less than 100 labeling actions are typically sufficient for good classification on a variety of specialized image datasets. Our contribution is unique given that it needs to perform dimensionality reduction, feature space visualization and editing, interactive label propagation, low-complexity active learning, human perceptual modeling, annotation emulation and unsupervised feature extraction for specialized datasets in a production-quality implementation.
