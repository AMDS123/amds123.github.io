##### Abstract
Appearance based person re-identification in a real-world video surveillance system with non-overlapping camera views is a challenging problem for many reasons. Current state-of-the-art methods often address the problem by relying on supervised learning of similarity metrics or ranking functions to implicitly model appearance transformation between cameras for each camera pair, or group, in the system. This requires considerable human effort to annotate data. Furthermore, the learned models are camera specific and not transferable from one set of cameras to another. Therefore, the annotation process is required after every network expansion or camera replacement, which strongly limits their applicability. Alternatively, we propose a novel modeling approach to harness complementary appearance information without supervised learning that significantly outperforms current state-of-the-art unsupervised methods on multiple benchmark datasets.

##### Abstract (translated by Google)
在具有不重叠的摄像机视图的真实视频监视系统中基于外观的人重新识别是一个具有挑战性的问题，原因很多。当前最先进的方法经常通过依赖于相似性度量或者排序函数的监督学习来解决该问题，以隐式地模拟系统中的每个相机对或者组的相机之间的相机变换。这需要大量的人力来注释数据。此外，学习模型是相机专用的，不能从一组相机转移到另一组相机。因此，每次网络扩容或更换摄像机后都需要进行注释处理，严重限制了其适用性。另外，我们提出了一种新颖的建模方法来利用互补的外观信息，而无需监督学习，显着优于目前最先进的多监测数据集上的无监督方法。
