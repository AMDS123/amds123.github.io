##### Abstract
Everything that exists in R is an object [Chambers2016]. This article examines what would be possible if we kept copies of all R objects that have ever been created. Not only objects but also their properties, meta-data, relations with other objects and information about context in which they were created. We introduce archivist, an R package designed to improve the management of results of data analysis. Key functionalities of this package include: (i) management of local and remote repositories which contain R objects and their meta-data (objects' properties and relations between them); (ii) archiving R objects to repositories; (iii) sharing and retrieving objects (and it's pedigree) by their unique hooks; (iv) searching for objects with specific properties or relations to other objects; (v) verification of object's identity and context of it's creation. The presented archivist package extends, in a combination with packages such as knitr and Sweave, the reproducible research paradigm by creating new ways to retrieve and validate previously calculated objects. These new features give a variety of opportunities such as: sharing R objects within reports or articles; adding hooks to R objects in table or figure captions; interactive exploration of object repositories; caching function calls with their results; retrieving object's pedigree (information about how the object was created); automated tracking of the performance of considered models, restoring R libraries to the state in which object was archived.

R中存在的所有东西都是一个对象[Chambers2016]。本文探讨了如果我们保留所有已创建的R对象的副本，那么可能会发生什么。不仅是对象，还有它们的属性，元数据，与其他对象的关系以及有关它们的创建环境的信息。我们介绍了档案管理员，一个R包，旨在改善数据分析结果的管理。该软件包的主要功能包括：（i）管理包含R对象及其元数据的本地和远程存储库（对象的属性和它们之间的关系）; （ii）将R对象存档到存储库; （iii）通过独特的钩子共享和检索物体（及其血统）; （iv）搜寻具有特定属性或与其他物体的关系的物体; （v）验证对象的身份及其创建的背景。所提供的档案管理软件包与knitr和Sweave等软件包相结合，通过创建检索和验证以前计算的对象的新方法，扩展了可重复的研究范例。这些新功能提供了各种机会，例如：在报告或文章中共享R对象;在表格或图形标题中为R对象添加钩子;对象库的交互式探索;缓存函数调用及其结果;检索对象的谱系（有关如何创建对象的信息）;自动跟踪所考虑模型的性能，将R库恢复到存档对象的状态。
