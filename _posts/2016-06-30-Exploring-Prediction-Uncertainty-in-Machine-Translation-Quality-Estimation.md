##### Abstract
Machine Translation Quality Estimation is a notoriously difficult task, which lessens its usefulness in real-world translation environments. Such scenarios can be improved if quality predictions are accompanied by a measure of uncertainty. However, models in this task are traditionally evaluated only in terms of point estimate metrics, which do not take prediction uncertainty into account. We investigate probabilistic methods for Quality Estimation that can provide well-calibrated uncertainty estimates and evaluate them in terms of their full posterior predictive distributions. We also show how this posterior information can be useful in an asymmetric risk scenario, which aims to capture typical situations in translation workflows.

机器翻译质量评估是一项众所周知的艰巨任务，在实际翻译环境中降低了它的实用性。如果质量预测伴随着不确定性的测量，这种情况可以得到改善。然而，这个任务中的模型传统上只是用点估计度量来评估，而不考虑预测的不确定性。我们调查质量估计的概率方法，可以提供良好校准的不确定性估计，并根据其后验预测分布进行评估。我们还展示了这种后验信息如何在非对称风险情况下有用，旨在捕捉翻译工作流程中的典型情况。
