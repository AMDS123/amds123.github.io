##### Abstract
Linear synthesis model based dictionary learning framework has achieved remarkable performances in image classification in the last decade. Behaved as a generative feature model, it however suffers from some intrinsic deficiencies. In this paper, we propose a novel parametric nonlinear analysis cosparse model (NACM) with which a unique feature vector will be much more efficiently extracted. Additionally, we derive a deep insight to demonstrate that NACM is capable of simultaneously learning the task adapted feature transformation and regularization to encode our preferences, domain prior knowledge and task oriented supervised information into the features. The proposed NACM is devoted to the classification task as a discriminative feature model and yield a novel discriminative nonlinear analysis operator learning framework (DNAOL). The theoretical analysis and experimental performances clearly demonstrate that DNAOL will not only achieve the better or at least competitive classification accuracies than the state-of-the-art algorithms but it can also dramatically reduce the time complexities in both training and testing phases.

基于线性综合模型的字典学习框架在近十年来在图像分类方面取得了显着的成绩。作为一个生成特征模型，它却遭受了一些固有的缺陷。在本文中，我们提出了一个新的参数非线性分析cosparse模型（NACM），其中一个独特的特征向量将被更有效地提取。此外，我们深刻的洞察到，证明NACM能够同时学习任务自适应特征变换和正则化，将我们的偏好，领域先验知识和面向任务的监督信息编码到特征中。提出的NACM致力于分类任务作为判别特征模型，并产生一个新的判别非线性分析算子学习框架（DNAOL）。理论分析和实验表明清楚地表明，DNAOL不仅比现有算法具有更好的或至少具有竞争力的分类精度，而且还可以显着减少训练和测试阶段的时间复杂性。
