##### Abstract
Spiking neural networks (SNNs) equipped with latency coding and spike-timing dependent plasticity rules offer an alternative to solve the data and energy bottlenecks of standard computer vision approaches: they can learn visual features without supervision and can be implemented by ultra-low power hardware architectures. However, their performance in image classification has never been evaluated on recent image datasets. In this paper, we compare SNNs to auto-encoders on three visual recognition datasets, and extend the use of SNNs to color images. Results show that SNNs are not competitive yet with traditional feature learning approaches, especially for color features. Further analyses of the results allow us to identify some of the bottlenecks of SNNs and provide specific directions towards improving their performance on vision tasks.
