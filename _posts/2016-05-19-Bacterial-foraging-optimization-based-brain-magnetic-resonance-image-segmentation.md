##### Abstract
Segmentation partitions an image into its constituent parts. It is essentially the pre-processing stage of image analysis and computer vision. In this work, T1 and T2 weighted brain magnetic resonance images are segmented using multilevel thresholding and bacterial foraging optimization (BFO) algorithm. The thresholds are obtained by maximizing the between class variance (multilevel Otsu method) of the image. The BFO algorithm is used to optimize the threshold searching process. The edges are then obtained from the thresholded image by comparing the intensity of each pixel with its eight connected neighbourhood. Post processing is performed to remove spurious responses in the segmented image. The proposed segmentation technique is evaluated using edge detector evaluation parameters such as figure of merit, Rand Index and variation of information. The proposed brain MR image segmentation technique outperforms the traditional edge detectors such as canny and sobel.

分割将图像分割成其组成部分。它本质上是图像分析和计算机视觉的预处理阶段。在这项工作中，使用多级阈值和细菌觅食优化（BFO）算法分割T1和T2加权脑磁共振图像。阈值是通过最大化图像之间的类间方差（多级Otsu方法）获得的。 BFO算法用于优化阈值搜索过程。然后通过比较每个像素的强度与其连接的八个邻域，从阈值图像中获得边缘。执行后处理以去除分段图像中的虚假响应。所提出的分割技术是使用边缘检测器评估参数（例如品质因数，兰德指数和信息变化）来评估的。提出的脑部MR图像分割技术胜过传统的边缘检测器，如canny和sobel。
