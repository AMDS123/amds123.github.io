##### Abstract
The nature of dispersal of many invasive pests and pathogens in agricultural and forestry makes it necessary to consider how the actions of one manager affect neighbouring properties. In addition to the direct effects of a potential spread of a pest and the resulting economic loss, there are also indirect consequences that affect whole regions and that require coordinated actions to manage and/or to eradicate it (like movement restrictions). In this paper we address the emergence and stability of cooperation among agents who respond to a threat of an invasive pest or disease. The model, based on the weakest-link paradigm, uses repeated multi-participant coordination games where players' pay-offs depend on management decisions to prevent the invasion on their own land as well as of their neighbours on a network. We show that for the basic cooperation game agents select the risk-dominant strategy of a Stag hunt game over the pay-off dominant strategy of implementing control measures. However, cooperation can be achieved by the social planner offering a biosecurity payment. The critical level of this payment depends on the details of the decision-making process, with higher trust (based on a reputation of other agents reflecting their past performance) allowing a significant reduction in necessary payments and slowing down decay in cooperation when the payment is low. We also find that allowing for uncertainty in decision-making process can enhance cooperation for low levels of payments. Finally, we show the importance of industry structure to the emergence of cooperation, with increase in the average coordination number of network nodes leading to increase in the critical biosecurity payment.

许多入侵性有害生物和病原体在农业和林业中扩散的性质使得有必要考虑一位管理者的行为如何影响邻近的财产。除了有害生物的潜在传播的直接影响以及由此造成的经济损失之外，还存在影响整个区域的间接后果，并且需要采取协调行动来管理和/或消除它（如运动限制）。在本文中，我们讨论了应对入侵性害虫或疾病威胁的代理人之间合作的出现和稳定性。该模型基于最薄弱环节范式，使用重复的多参与者协调游戏，其中玩家的回报取决于管理决策，以防止在他们自己的土地上以及他们在网络上的邻居的入侵。我们表明，对于基本合作游戏代理，选择Stag狩猎游戏的风险主导策略而不是实施控制措施的支付主导策略。但是，社会规划者可以通过提供生物安全支付来实现合作。这种支付的关键水平取决于决策过程的细节，具有更高的信任度（基于反映其过去业绩的其他代理商的声誉），允许大幅减少必要的支付并减少合作时的付款衰减低。我们还发现，允许决策过程中的不确定性可以加强低水平支付的合作。最后，我们展示了产业结构对合作出现的重要性，随着网络节点平均协调数量的增加，导致关键生物安全支付的增加。
