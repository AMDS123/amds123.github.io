##### Abstract
This paper presents a novel deep learning framework for human trajectory prediction and detecting social group membership in crowds. We introduce a generative adversarial pipeline which preserves the spatio-temporal structure of the pedestrian's neighbourhood, enabling us to extract relevant attributes describing their social identity. We formulate the group detection task as an unsupervised learning problem, obviating the need for supervised learning of group memberships via hand labeled databases, allowing us to directly employ the proposed framework in different surveillance settings. We evaluate the proposed trajectory prediction and group detection frameworks on multiple public benchmarks, and for both tasks the proposed method demonstrates its capability to better anticipate human sociological behaviour compared to the existing state-of-the-art methods.
