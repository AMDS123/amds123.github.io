##### Abstract
We extend the theoretical analysis of a recently proposed single subspace learning algorithm, called Dual Principal Component Pursuit (DPCP), to the case where the data are drawn from of a union of hyperplanes. To gain insight into the properties of the $\ell_1$ non-convex problem associated with DPCP, we develop a geometric analysis of a closely related continuous optimization problem. Then transferring this analysis to the discrete problem, our results state that as long as the hyperplanes are sufficiently separated, the dominant hyperplane is sufficiently dominant and the points are uniformly distributed inside the associated hyperplanes, then the non-convex DPCP problem has a unique global solution, equal to the normal vector of the dominant hyperplane. This suggests the correctness of a sequential hyperplane learning algorithm based on DPCP. A thorough experimental evaluation reveals that hyperplane learning schemes based on DPCP dramatically improve over the state-of-the-art methods for the case of synthetic data, while are competitive to the state-of-the-art in the case of 3D plane clustering for Kinect data.

我们将最近提出的单子空间学习算法（称为双主成分追踪（DPCP））的理论分析扩展到数据来自超平面联合的情况。为了深入了解与DPCP相关的$ \ ell_1 $非凸问题的性质，我们开发了一个密切相关的连续优化问题的几何分析。然后把这个分析转化为离散问题，我们的结果表明，只要超平面足够分离，主导超平面足够占优势，并且点在关联超平面内均匀分布，那么非凸DPCP问题就具有唯一的全局解，等于主导超平面的法向量。这表明了基于DPCP的顺序超平面学习算法的正确性。彻底的实验评估表明，基于DPCP的超平面学习方案相对于合成数据情况下的最先进的方法有了显着的提高，而在3D平面聚类的情况下却具有竞争力为Kinect数据。
