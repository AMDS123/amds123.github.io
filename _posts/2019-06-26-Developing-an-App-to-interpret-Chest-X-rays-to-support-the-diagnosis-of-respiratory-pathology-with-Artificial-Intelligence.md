##### Abstract
In this paper we present our work to improve access to diagnosis in remote areas where good quality medical services may be lacking. We develop new Machine Learning methodologies for deployment onto mobile devices to help the early diagnosis of a number of life-threatening conditions using X-ray images. By using the latest developments in fast and portable Artificial Intelligence environments, we develop a smartphone app using an Artificial Neural Network to assist physicians in their diagnostic.
