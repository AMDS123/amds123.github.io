##### Abstract
Meningioma brain tumour discrimination is challenging as many histological patterns are mixed between the different subtypes. In clinical practice, dominant patterns are investigated for signs of specific meningioma pathology; however the simple observation could result in inter- and intra-observer variation due to the complexity of the histopathological patterns. Also employing a computerised feature extraction approach applied at a single resolution scale might not suffice in accurately delineating the mixture of histopathological patterns. In this work we propose a novel multiresolution feature extraction approach for characterising the textural properties of the different pathological patterns (i.e. mainly cell nuclei shape, orientation and spatial arrangement within the cytoplasm). The pattern textural properties are characterised at various scales and orientations for an improved separability between the different extracted features. The Gabor filter energy output of each magnitude response was combined with four other fixed-resolution texture signatures (2 model-based and 2 statistical-based) with and without cell nuclei segmentation. The highest classification accuracy of 95% was reported when combining the Gabor filters energy and the meningioma subimage fractal signature as a feature vector without performing any prior cell nuceli segmentation. This indicates that characterising the cell-nuclei self-similarity properties via Gabor filters can assists in achieving an improved meningioma subtype classification, which can assist in overcoming variations in reported diagnosis.

由于许多组织学模式在不同亚型之间混合，所以脑膜瘤脑瘤鉴别是具有挑战性的。在临床实践中，调查显性模式的特定脑膜瘤病理征象;然而，由于组织病理学模式的复杂性，简单的观察可能导致观察者间和观察者间的差异。同样采用计算机化的特征提取方法应用于单一的分辨率尺度可能不足以准确描绘组织病理学模式的混合物。在这项工作中，我们提出了一种新的多分辨率特征提取方法来表征不同病理模式（即主要是细胞核的形状，取向和空间安排在细胞质内）的纹理特性。模式纹理属性在不同尺度和取向下表征，以改善不同提取的特征之间的可分离性。每个幅度响应的Gabor滤波器能量输出与四个其他固定分辨率纹理签名（2个基于模型的和2个基于统计的）相结合，具有和不具有细胞核分割。当将Gabor滤波器能量和脑膜瘤子图像分形签名组合作为特征向量而不执行任何先前的细胞核素分割时，报告了95％的最高分类准确度。这表明通过Gabor滤波器表征细胞核自相似特性可以有助于实现改善的脑膜瘤亚型分类，这有助于克服所报道的诊断中的变化。
