##### Abstract
The coherent folded longitudinal acoustic phonons (FLAPs) in gold nanoparticles (NPs) imbedded InGaN/GaN sample have been studied using degenerate pump-probe technique. When the FLAPs are generated within the multiple quantum wells, the zone-center FLAPs extending from multiple quantum wells is detected in the GaN and sapphire substrate. Up to five phonon modes are clearly observed and they are well explained by the back and forth propagation of the signal phonon wave packet in the InGaN/GaN quantum wells. The results are consistent with similar measurements to GaAs/AlAs superlattices.
