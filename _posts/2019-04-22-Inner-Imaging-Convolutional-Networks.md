##### Abstract
Despite the tremendous success in computer vision, deep convolutional networks suffer from serious computation cost and redundancies. Although previous works address this issue by enhancing diversities of filters, they ignore that both complementarity and completeness are required in the internal structure of convolutional network. In this setting, we propose a novel Inner-Imaging architecture, which allows relationships between channels to meet the above requirement. Specifically, we organize the filter signal points in groups using convolutional kernels to model both the intra- and inter-group relationships simultaneously. Consequently, we not only increase diversities of channels but also explicitly enhance the complementarity and completeness. Our proposed architecture is lightweight and easy to be implemented for improving the modelling efficiency and performance. We conduct extensive experiments on CIFAR, SVHN and ImageNet and verify the effectiveness of our inner-imaging architecture with residual networks as the backbone.
