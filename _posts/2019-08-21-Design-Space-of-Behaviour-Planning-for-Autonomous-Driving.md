##### Abstract
We explore the complex design space of behaviour planning for autonomous driving. Design choices that successfully address one aspect of behaviour planning can critically constrain others. To aid the design process, in this work we decompose the design space with respect to important choices arising from the current state of the art approaches, and describe the resulting trade-offs. In doing this, we also identify interesting directions of future work.
