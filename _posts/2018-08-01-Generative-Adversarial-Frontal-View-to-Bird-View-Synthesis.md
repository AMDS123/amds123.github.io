##### Abstract
Environment perception is an important task with great practical value and bird view is an essential part for creating panoramas of surrounding environment. Due to the large gap and severe deformation between the frontal view and bird view, generating a bird view image from a single frontal view is challenging. To tackle this problem, we propose the BridgeGAN, i.e., a novel generative model for bird view synthesis. First, an intermediate view, i.e., homography view, is introduced to bridge the large gap. Next, conditioned on the three views (frontal view, homography view and bird view) in our task, a multi-GAN based model is proposed to learn the challenging cross-view translation. Extensive experiments conducted on a synthetic dataset have demonstrated that the images generated by our model are much better than those generated by existing methods, with more consistent global appearance and sharper details. Ablation studies and discussions show its reliability and robustness in some challenging cases.

环境感知是一项具有重要实用价值的重要任务，鸟类视野是创造周围环境全景的重要组成部分。由于正面视图和鸟瞰图之间的大间隙和严重变形，从单个正面视图生成鸟瞰图图像是具有挑战性的。为了解决这个问题，我们提出了BridgeGAN，即鸟类视图合成的新型生成模型。首先，引入中间视图，即单应视图，以桥接大间隙。接下来，以我们的任务中的三个视图（正视图，单应视图和鸟瞰图）为条件，提出了基于多GAN的模型来学习具有挑战性的跨视图翻译。在合成数据集上进行的大量实验表明，我们的模型生成的图像比现有方法生成的图像要好得多，具有更一致的全局外观和更清晰的细节。消融研究和讨论显示其在一些具有挑战性的案例中的可靠性和稳健性。
