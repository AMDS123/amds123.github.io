##### Abstract
An automatic classification method has been studied to effectively detect and recognize Electrocardiogram (ECG). Based on the synchronizing and orthogonal relationships of multiple leads, we propose a Multi-branch Convolution and Residual Network (MBCRNet) with three kinds of feature fusion methods for automatic detection of normal and abnormal ECG signals. Experiments are conducted on the Chinese Cardiovascular Disease Database (CCDD). Through 10-fold cross-validation, we achieve an average accuracy of 87.04% and a sensitivity of 89.93%, which outperforms previous methods under the same database. It is also shown that the multi-lead feature fusion network can improve the classification accuracy over the network only with the single lead features.

已经研究了一种自动分类方法来有效地检测和识别心电图（ECG）。基于多个引线的同步和正交关系，我们提出了一种多分支卷积和残余网络（MBCRNet），它具有三种特征融合方法，用于自动检测正常和异常的ECG信号。实验在中国心血管病数据库（CCDD）上进行。通过10次交叉验证，我们实现了87.04％的平均准确度和89.93％的灵敏度，在同一数据库下优于以前的方法。还表明，多引导特征融合网络仅通过单引线特征可以提高网络上的分类精度。
