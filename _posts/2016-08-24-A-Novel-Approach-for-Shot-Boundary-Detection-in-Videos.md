##### Abstract
This paper presents a novel approach for video shot boundary detection. The proposed approach is based on split and merge concept. A fisher linear discriminant criterion is used to guide the process of both splitting and merging. For the purpose of capturing the between class and within class scatter we employ 2D2 FLD method which works on texture feature of regions in each frame of a video. Further to reduce the complexity of the process we propose to employ spectral clustering to group related regions together to a single there by achieving reduction in dimension. The proposed method is experimentally also validated on a cricket video. It is revealed that shots obtained by the proposed approach are highly cohesive and loosely coupled

本文提出了一种新的视频镜头边界检测方法。所提出的方法基于拆分和合并的概念。 Fisher线性判别准则用于指导分裂和合并的过程。为了捕捉类间和类内散射的目的，我们采用2D2 FLD方法来处理视频的每一帧中的区域的纹理特征。为了减少过程的复杂性，我们建议使用谱聚类，通过实现尺寸的减小，将相关区域合并为一个单独的区域。所提出的方法在实验上也在板球视频上进行了验证。据透露，由提出的方法获得的镜头是高度内聚和松散耦合
