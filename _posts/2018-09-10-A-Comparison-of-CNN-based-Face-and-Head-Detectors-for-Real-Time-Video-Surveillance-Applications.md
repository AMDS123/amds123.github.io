##### Abstract
Detecting faces and heads appearing in video feeds are challenging tasks in real-world video surveillance applications due to variations in appearance, occlusions and complex backgrounds. Recently, several CNN architectures have been proposed to increase the accuracy of detectors, although their computational complexity can be an issue, especially for real-time applications, where faces and heads must be detected live using high-resolution cameras. This paper compares the accuracy and complexity of state-of-the-art CNN architectures that are suitable for face and head detection. Single pass and region-based architectures are reviewed and compared empirically to baseline techniques according to accuracy and to time and memory complexity on images from several challenging datasets. The viability of these architectures is analyzed with real-time video surveillance applications in mind. Results suggest that, although CNN architectures can achieve a very high level of accuracy compared to traditional detectors, their computational cost can represent a limitation for many practical real-time applications.

由于外观，遮挡和复杂背景的变化，检测视频输入中出现的面部和头部在现实世界的视频监视应用中是具有挑战性的任务。最近，已经提出了几种CNN架构来提高检测器的准确度，尽管它们的计算复杂性可能是一个问题，特别是对于必须使用高分辨率相机实时检测面部和头部的实时应用。本文比较了适用于面部和头部检测的最先进CNN架构的准确性和复杂性。根据准确性以及来自几个具有挑战性的数据集的图像的时间和内存复杂性，对单通道和基于区域的体系结构进行了回顾，并根据经验与基线技术进行了比较。考虑到实时视频监控应用，分析了这些架构的可行性。结果表明，尽管与传统探测器相比，CNN架构可以实现非常高的精度，但是它们的计算成本可能代表许多实际实时应用的限制。
