##### Abstract
This paper presents an end-to-end neural network model, named Neural Generative Question Answering (GENQA), that can generate answers to simple factoid questions, based on the facts in a knowledge-base. More specifically, the model is built on the encoder-decoder framework for sequence-to-sequence learning, while equipped with the ability to enquire the knowledge-base, and is trained on a corpus of question-answer pairs, with their associated triples in the knowledge-base. Empirical study shows the proposed model can effectively deal with the variations of questions and answers, and generate right and natural answers by referring to the facts in the knowledge-base. The experiment on question answering demonstrates that the proposed model can outperform an embedding-based QA model as well as a neural dialogue model trained on the same data.

本文提出了一个端到端的神经网络模型，称为神经生成问题回答（GENQA），可以根据知识库中的事实生成简单的事实问题的答案。更具体地说，该模型建立在用于序列到序列学习的编码器 - 解码器框架上，同时配备了查询知识库的能力，并且在问答对的语料库上训练，并且其关联的三元组知识库。实证研究表明，该模型能够有效地处理问题和答案的变化，并参考知识库中的事实生成正确，自然的答案。问题回答实验表明，所提出的模型可以超越基于嵌入的QA模型以及训练相同数据的神经对话模型。
