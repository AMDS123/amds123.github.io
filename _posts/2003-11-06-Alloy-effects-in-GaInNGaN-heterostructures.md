##### Abstract
We show that the large band offsets between GaN and InN and the heavy carrier effective masses preclude the use of the Virtual Crystal Approximation to describe the electronic structure of Ga_(1-x)In_(x)N/GaN heterostructures while this approximation works very well for the Ga_(1-x)In_(x)As/GaAs heterostructures.
