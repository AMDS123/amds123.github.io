##### Abstract
Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASDs) are often associated with specific atypical postural or motor behaviors, of which Stereotypical Motor Movements (SMMs) have a specific visibility. While the identification and the quantification of SMM patterns remain complex, its automation would provide support to accurate tuning of the intervention in the therapy of autism. Therefore, it is essential to develop automatic SMM detection systems in a real world setting, taking care of strong inter-subject and intra-subject variability. Wireless accelerometer sensing technology can provide a valid infrastructure for real-time SMM detection, however such variability remains a problem also for machine learning methods, in particular whenever handcrafted features extracted from accelerometer signal are considered. Here, we propose to employ the deep learning paradigm in order to learn discriminating features from multi-sensor accelerometer signals. Our results provide preliminary evidence that feature learning and transfer learning embedded in the deep architecture achieve higher accurate SMM detectors in longitudinal scenarios.

自闭症谱系障碍（ASD）通常与特定的非典型的姿势或运动行为有关，其中定型运动动作（SMM）具有特定的可见度。尽管SMM模式的识别和量化仍然很复杂，但其自动化将为准确调整自闭症治疗干预措施提供支持。因此，在现实世界中开发自动SMM检测系统是至关重要的，要注意强大的主体间和主体内变化。无线加速度计感测技术可以为实时SMM检测提供有效的基础设施，然而这种可变性仍然是机器学习方法的问题，特别是当考虑从加速度计信号提取的手工特征时。在这里，我们建议采用深度学习的范例，以便从多传感器加速度计信号中学习识别特征。我们的研究结果提供了初步的证据表明，嵌入在深层结构中的特征学习和转移学习在纵向场景中获得更高精度的SMM探测器
