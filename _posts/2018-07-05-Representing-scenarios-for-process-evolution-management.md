##### Abstract
In the following writing we discuss a conceptual framework for representing events and scenarios from the perspective of a novel form of causal analysis. This causal analysis is applied to the events and scenarios so as to determine measures that could be used to manage the development of the processes that they are a part of in real time. An overall terminological framework and entity-relationship model are suggested along with a specification of the functional sets involved in both reasoning and analytics. The model is considered to be a specific case of the generic problem of finding sequential series in disparate data. The specific inference and reasoning processes are identified for future implementation.

在下面的文章中，我们讨论了一种概念框架，用于从一种新颖的因果分析形式的角度来表示事件和场景。这种因果分析应用于事件和场景，以确定可用于管理他们实时参与的过程开发的度量。建议使用整体术语框架和实体关系模型以及推理和分析中涉及的功能集的规范。该模型被认为是在不同数据中查找序列系列的一般问题的特定情况。确定具体的推理和推理过程以供将来实施。
