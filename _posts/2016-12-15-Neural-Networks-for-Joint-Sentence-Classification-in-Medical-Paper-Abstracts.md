##### Abstract
Existing models based on artificial neural networks (ANNs) for sentence classification often do not incorporate the context in which sentences appear, and classify sentences individually. However, traditional sentence classification approaches have been shown to greatly benefit from jointly classifying subsequent sentences, such as with conditional random fields. In this work, we present an ANN architecture that combines the effectiveness of typical ANN models to classify sentences in isolation, with the strength of structured prediction. Our model achieves state-of-the-art results on two different datasets for sequential sentence classification in medical abstracts.

现有的基于人工神经网络（ANNs）的句子分类模型通常不包含句子出现的上下文，而是单独分类句子。然而，传统的句子分类方法已被证明是从联合分类随后的句子，如条件随机领域大大受益。在这项工作中，我们提出了一个人工神经网络的体系结构，结合了典型人工神经网络模型的有效性，孤立地分类句子，结构预测的力量。我们的模型在两个不同的数据集上获得了最先进的结果，用于医学摘要中的顺序句子分类。
