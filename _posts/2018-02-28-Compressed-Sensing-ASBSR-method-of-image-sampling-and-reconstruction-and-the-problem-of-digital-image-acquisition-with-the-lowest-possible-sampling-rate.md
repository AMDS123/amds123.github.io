##### Abstract
The problem of minimization of the number of measurements needed for digital image acquisition and reconstruction with a given accuracy is addressed. Basics of the sampling theory are outlined to show that the lower bound of signal sampling rate sufficient for signal reconstruction with a given accuracy is equal to the spectrum sparsity of the signal sparse approximation that has this accuracy. It is revealed that the compressed sensing approach, which was advanced as a solution to the sampling rate minimization problem, is far from reaching the sampling rate theoretical minimum. Potentials and limitations of compressed sensing are demystified using a simple and intutive model, A method of image Arbitrary Sampling and Bounded Spectrum Reconstruction (ASBSR-method) is described that allows to draw near the image sampling rate theoretical minimum. Presented and discussed are also results of experimental verification of the ASBSR-method and its possible applicability extensions to solving various underdetermined inverse problems such as color image demosaicing, image in-painting, image reconstruction from their sparsely sampled or decimated projections, image reconstruction from the modulus of its Fourier spectrum, and image reconstruction from its sparse samples in Fourier domain

解决了以给定精度对数字图像采集和重建所需的测量次数最小化的问题。抽样理论的基本概述表明，信号采样率足够用于给定精度的信号重构的下界等于具有该精度的信号稀疏近似的谱稀疏度。据揭示，作为解决采样率最小化问题的先进压缩感知方法远未达到采样率理论最小值。描述了压缩感知的潜力和局限性，使用简单和直观的模型。图像任意采样和有界频谱重建（ASBSR-方法）的方法被描述，其允许在图像采样率理论最小值附近绘制图像。所提出和讨论的也是ASBSR方法的实验验证结果，以及其可用于解决各种欠定反演问题的可能适用性扩展，例如彩色图像去马赛克，绘图中的图像，从其稀疏采样或抽取投影的图像重建，来自其傅里叶谱的模量，以及从其傅立叶域中的稀疏样本重建图像
