##### Abstract
The amount of surgical data, recorded during video-monitored surgeries, has extremely increased. This paper aims at improving existing solutions for the automated analysis of cataract surgeries in real time. Through the analysis of a video recording the operating table, it is possible to know which instruments exit or enter the operating table, and therefore which ones are likely being used by the surgeon. Combining these observations with observations from the microscope video should enhance the overall performance of the systems. To this end, the proposed solution is divided into two main parts: one to detect the instruments at the beginning of the surgery and one to update the list of instruments every time a change is detected in the scene. In the first part, the goal is to separate the instruments from the background and from irrelevant objects. For the second, we are interested in detecting the instruments that appear and disappear whenever the surgeon interacts with the table. Experiments on a dataset of 36 cataract surgeries validate the good performance of the proposed solution.

视频监测手术中记录的手术数据量已经大大增加。本文旨在改进现有的白内障手术实时自动分析解决方案。通过分析手术台的视频记录，可以知道哪些仪器退出或进入手术台，因此外科医生可能正在使用哪些仪器。将这些观察结果与显微镜视频的观察结合起来可以提高系统的整体性能。为此，所提出的解决方案分为两个主要部分：一个在手术开始时检测器械，一个在每次在场景中检测到变化时更新器械清单。第一部分的目标是将乐器从背景和不相关的物体中分离出来。对于第二个，我们感兴趣的是当外科医生与桌子交互时，检测出现和消失的器械。在36个白内障手术数据集上的实验证实了所提出的解决方案的良好性能。
