##### Abstract
Purpose of review: This paper presents a review of the current state of the art in remote sensing based monitoring of forest disturbances and forest degradation from optical Earth Observation data. Part one comprises an overview of currently available optical remote sensing sensors, which can be used for forest disturbance and degradation mapping. Part two reviews the two main categories of existing approaches: classical image-to-image change detection and time series analysis. Recent findings: With the launch of the Sentinel-2a satellite and available Landsat imagery, time series analysis has become the most promising but also most demanding category of degradation mapping approaches. Four time series classification methods are distinguished. The methods are explained and their benefits and drawbacks are discussed. A separate chapter presents a number of recent forest degradation mapping studies for two different ecosystems: temperate forests with a geographical focus on Europe and tropical forests with a geographical focus on Africa. Summary: The review revealed that a wide variety of methods for the detection of forest degradation is already available. Today, the main challenge is to transfer these approaches to high resolution time series data from multiple sensors. Future research should also focus on the classification of disturbance types and the development of robust up-scalable methods to enable near real time disturbance mapping in support of operational reactive measures.

审查目的：本文介绍了基于遥感监测森林扰动和光学地球观测数据森林退化情况的现状。第一部分包括目前可用的光学遥感传感器的概述，可用于森林干扰和退化映射。第二部分回顾了现有方法的两个主要类别：经典的图像到图像变化检测和时间序列分析。最近的发现：随着哨兵-2a卫星和Landsat卫星图像的发布，时间序列分析已经成为最有前途但也是要求最苛刻的退化绘图方法。四种时间序列分类方法是有区别的。对这些方法进行了解释，并讨论了它们的优点和缺点。另一章介绍了近期针对两种不同生态系统进行的森林退化绘图研究：以欧洲为重点的温带森林和以非洲为重点的热带森林。总结：审查结果显示，已经有多种检测森林退化的方法。今天，主要的挑战是将这些方法转换为来自多个传感器的高分辨率时间序列数据。未来的研究还应侧重于扰动类型的分类和强大的可升级方法的发展，以实现近实时干扰测绘以支持运行反应措施。
