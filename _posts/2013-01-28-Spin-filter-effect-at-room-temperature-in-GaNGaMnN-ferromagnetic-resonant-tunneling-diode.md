##### Abstract
We have investigated the spin current polarization without the external magnetic field in the resonant tunneling diode with the emitter and quantum well layers made from the ferromagnetic GaMnN. For this purpose we have applied the self-consistent Wigner-Poisson method and studied the spin-polarizing effect of the parallel and antiparallel alignment of the magnetization in the ferromagnetic layers. The results of our calculations show that the antiparallel magnetization is much more advantageous for the spin filter operation and leads to the full spin current polarization at low temperatures and 35 % spin polarization of the current at room temperature.
