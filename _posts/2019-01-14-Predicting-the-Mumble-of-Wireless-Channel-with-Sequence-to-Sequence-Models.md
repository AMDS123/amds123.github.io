##### Abstract
Accurate prediction of fading channel in future is essential to realize adaptive transmission and other methods that can save power and provide gains. In practice, wireless channel model can be regarded as a new language model, and the time-varying channel can be seen as mumbling in this language, which is too complex to understand, to say nothing of prediction. Fortunately, neural networks have been proved efficient in learning language models in recent times, moreover, sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) models can provide the state of the art performance in various tasks such as machine translation, image caption generation, and text summarization. Predicting channel with neural networks seems promising, however, vanilla neural networks cannot deal with complex-valued inputs while channel state information (CSI) is in complex domain. In this paper, we present a powerful method to understand and predict complex-valued channel by utilizing seq2seq models, the results show that seq2seq models are also expert in time series prediction, and realistic channel prediction with comparable or superior performance relative to channel estimation is attainable.
