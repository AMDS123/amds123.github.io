##### Abstract
The robustness to noise and outliers is an important issue in linear representation in real applications. We focus on the problem that samples are grossly corrupted, which is also the 'sample specific' corruptions problem. A reasonable assumption is that corrupted samples cannot be represented by the dictionary while clean samples can be well represented. This assumption is enforced in this paper by investigating the coefficients of corrupted samples. Concretely, we require the coefficients of corrupted samples be zero. In this way, the representation quality of clean data can be assured without the effect of corrupted data. At last, a robust dictionary based data representation approach and its sparse representation version are proposed, which have directive significance for future applications.

噪声和异常值的鲁棒性是实际应用中线性表示的一个重要问题。我们关注样本严重腐败的问题，这也是“样本特定的”腐败问题。一个合理的假设是，损坏的样本不能用字典来表示，而干净的样本可以很好地表示。这个假设是通过调查腐败样本的系数在本文中强制执行的。具体来说，我们要求损坏样本的系数为零。这样可以保证清洁数据的表示质量不受数据损坏的影响。最后，提出了一种鲁棒的基于字典的数据表示方法及其稀疏表示版本，对未来的应用具有指导意义。
