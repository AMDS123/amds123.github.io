##### Abstract
We have developed an application aiming at federated search for EU and Hungarian legislation and jurisdiction. It now contains above 1 million documents, with daily updates. The database holds documents downloaded from the EU sources EUR-Lex and Curia Online as well as public jurisdiction documents from the Constitutional Court of Hungary and The National Office for The Judiciary. The application is termed Justeus. Justeus provides comprehensible search possibilities. Besides free text and metadata (dropdown list) searches, it features hierarchical data structures (concept hierarchy trees) of directory codes and classification as well as subject terms. Justeus collects all links of a particular document to other documents (court judgements citing other case law documents as well as legislation, national court decisions referring to EU regulation etc.) as tables and directed graph networks. Choosing a document, its relations to other documents are visualized in real time as a network. Network graphs help in identifying key documents influencing or referred by many other documents (legislative and/or jurisdictive) and sets of documents predominantly referring to each other (citation networks).
