##### Abstract
Natural Language Interfaces and tools such as spellcheckers and Web search in one's own language are known to be useful in ICT-mediated communication. Most languages in Southern Africa are under-resourced, however. Therefore, it would be very useful if both the generic and the few language-specific NLP tools could be reused or easily adapted across languages. This depends on the notion, and extent, of similarity between the languages. We assess this from the angle of orthography and corpora. Twelve versions of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR) are examined, showing clusters of languages, and which are thus more or less amenable to cross-language adaptation of NLP tools, which do not match with Guthrie zones. To examine the generalisability of these results, we zoom in on isiZulu both quantitatively and qualitatively with four other corpora and texts in different genres. The results show that the UDHR is a typical text document orthographically. The results also provide insight into usability of typical measures such as lexical diversity and genre, and that the same statistic may mean different things in different documents. While NLTK for Python could be used for basic analyses of text, it, and similar NLP tools, will need considerable customization.

自然语言接口和工具，如拼写检查和网络搜索以自己的语言已知在信息通讯技术中介有用。然而，南部非洲大多数语言的资源不足。因此，如果通用语言和少数特定于语言的NLP工具可以重复使用或轻松地跨语言进行调整，那将是非常有用的。这取决于语言之间相似性的概念和程度。我们从正字法和语料库的角度来评估这一点。对“世界人权宣言”（UDHR）的十二个版本进行了审查，显示了一组语言，因此它们或多或少地适应与Guthrie地区不匹配的NLP工具的跨语言改编。为了检验这些结果的普遍性，我们放大了isiZulu的数量和质量与四个不同流派的语料库和文本。结果表明，UDHR是一个典型的正文文本文件。这些结果还提供了对词汇多样性和流派等典型度量可用性的洞察力，同一个统计量在不同的文件中可能意味着不同的事物。虽然用于Python的NLTK可用于文本的基本分析，但它和类似的NLP工具将需要大量的定制。
