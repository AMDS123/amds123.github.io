##### Abstract
This paper proposes using sketch algorithms to represent the votes in Hough transforms. Replacing the accumulator array with a sketch (Sketch Hough Transform - SHT) significantly reduces the memory needed to compute a Hough transform. We also present a new sketch, Count Median Update, which works better than known sketch methods for replacing the accumulator array in the Hough Transform.
