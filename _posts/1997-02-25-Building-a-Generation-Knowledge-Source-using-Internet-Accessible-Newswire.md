##### Abstract
In this paper, we describe a method for automatic creation of a knowledge source for text generation using information extraction over the Internet. We present a prototype system called PROFILE which uses a client-server architecture to extract noun-phrase descriptions of entities such as people, places, and organizations. The system serves two purposes: as an information extraction tool, it allows users to search for textual descriptions of entities; as a utility to generate functional descriptions (FD), it is used in a functional-unification based generation system. We present an evaluation of the approach and its applications to natural language generation and summarization.
