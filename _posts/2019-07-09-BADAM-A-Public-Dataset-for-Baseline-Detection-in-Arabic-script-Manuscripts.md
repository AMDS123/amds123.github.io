##### Abstract
The application of handwritten text recognition to historical works is highly dependant on accurate text line retrieval. A number of systems utilizing a robust baseline detection paradigm have emerged recently but the advancement of layout analysis methods for challenging scripts is held back by the lack of well-established datasets including works in non-Latin scripts. We present a dataset of 400 annotated document images from different domains and time periods. A short elaboration on the particular challenges posed by handwriting in Arabic script for layout analysis and subsequent processing steps is given. Lastly, we propose a method based on a fully convolutional encoder-decoder network to extract arbitrarily shaped text line images from manuscripts.
