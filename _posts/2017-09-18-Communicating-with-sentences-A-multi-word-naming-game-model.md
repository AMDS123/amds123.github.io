##### Abstract
Naming game simulates the process of naming an object by a single word, in which a population of communicating agents can reach global consensus asymptotically through iteratively pair-wise conversations. We propose an extension of the single-word model to a multi-word naming game (MWNG), simulating the case of describing a complex object by a sentence (multiple words). Words are defined in categories, and then organized as sentences by combining them from different categories. We refer to a formatted combination of several words as a pattern. In such an MWNG, through a pair-wise conversation, it requires the hearer to achieve consensus with the speaker with respect to both every single word in the sentence as well as the sentence pattern, so as to guarantee the correct meaning of the saying, otherwise, they fail reaching consensus in the interaction. We validate the model in three typical topologies as the underlying communication network, and employ both conventional and man-designed patterns in performing the MWNG.

命名游戏通过一个单词来模拟命名一个对象的过程，在这个过程中，一群通信代理可以通过迭代的成对对话来渐近地达成全局共识。我们提出将单词模型扩展为多词命名游戏（MWNG），模拟用一个句子（多个词）描述复杂对象的情况。单词是按类别定义的，然后通过组合成不同类别的句子。我们将几个单词的格式化组合称为模式。在这样一个MWNG中，通过一对一的交谈，要求听者对句子中的每一个单词和句型都要与说话者达成共识，以保证说话的正确含义，否则，他们在互动中达不到共识。我们验证了三种典型拓扑中的模型作为底层通信网络，并使用传统和人工设计的模式来执行MWNG。
