##### Abstract
We introduce a method for modeling a configuration of objects in 2D or 3D images using a mathematical "skeletal linking structure" which will simultaneously capture the individual shape features of the objects and their positional information relative to one another. The objects may either have smooth boundaries and be disjoint from the others or share common portions of their boundaries with other objects in a piecewise smooth manner. These structures include a special class of "Blum medial linking structures," which are intrinsically associated to the configuration and build upon the Blum medial axes of the individual objects. We give a classification of the properties of Blum linking structures for generic configurations. The skeletal linking structures add increased flexibility for modeling configurations of objects by relaxing the Blum conditions and they extend in a minimal way the individual "skeletal structures" which have been previously used for modeling individual objects and capturing their geometric properties. This allows for the mathematical methods introduced for single objects to be significantly extended to the entire configuration of objects. These methods not only capture the internal shape structures of the individual objects but also the external structure of the neighboring regions of the objects.

我们介绍一种使用数学“骨架链接结构”在2D或3D图像中建模对象的配置的方法，该方法将同时捕获对象的各个形状特征及其相对于彼此的位置信息。物体可以具有平滑的边界并且与其他物体不相交，或者以分段平滑的方式与其他物体共享其边界的公共部分。这些结构包括一类特殊的“百隆中间连接结构”，它们与内部结构有关，并且建立在单个对象的百隆中轴上。我们给出Blum连接结构属性的一般分类。骨架链接结构通过放宽Blum条件增加了对对象建模的灵活性，并且以最小的方式扩展了以前用于建模单个对象和捕获它们几何属性的单个“骨架结构”。这允许为单个对象引入的数学方法显着扩展到对象的整个配置。这些方法不仅捕获单个物体的内部形状结构，而且还捕获物体邻近区域的外部结构。
