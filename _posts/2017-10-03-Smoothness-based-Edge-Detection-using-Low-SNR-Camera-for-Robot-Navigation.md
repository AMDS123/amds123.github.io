##### Abstract
In the emerging advancement in the branch of autonomous robotics, the ability of a robot to efficiently localize and construct maps of its surrounding is crucial. This paper deals with utilizing thermal-infrared cameras, as opposed to conventional cameras as the primary sensor to capture images of the robot's surroundings. For localization, the images need to be further processed before feeding them to a navigational system. The main motivation of this paper was to develop an edge detection methodology capable of utilizing the low-SNR poor output from such a thermal camera and effectively detect smooth edges of the surrounding environment. The enhanced edge detector proposed in this paper takes the raw image from the thermal sensor, denoises the images, applies Canny edge detection followed by CSS method. The edges are ranked to remove any noise and only edges of the highest rank are kept. Then, the broken edges are linked by computing edge metrics and a smooth edge of the surrounding is displayed in a binary image. Several comparisons are also made in the paper between the proposed technique and the existing techniques.

在自主机器人分支的新兴进展中，机器人有效定位和构建其周围地图的能力至关重要。本文涉及利用热红外相机，而不是传统的相机作为主要传感器来捕捉机器人周围的图像。为了定位，在将图像馈送到导航系统之前，图像需要被进一步处理。本文的主要动机是开发一种边缘检测方法，能够利用这种热像仪的低信噪比差输出，并有效检测周围环境的平滑边缘。本文提出的增强边缘检测算子将热传感器的原始图像进行去噪，对图像进行去噪处理，再应用Canny边缘检测，然后采用CSS方法。边缘被排序去除任何噪声，只保留最高级别的边缘。然后，通过计算边缘度量链接断开的边缘，并且用二进制图像显示周围的平滑边缘。本文还对所提出的技术与现有技术进行了比较。
