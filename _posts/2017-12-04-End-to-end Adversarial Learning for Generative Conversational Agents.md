##### Abstract
This paper presents a new adversarial learning method for generative conversational agents (GCA) besides a new model of GCA. Similar to previous works on adversarial learning for dialogue generation, our method assumes the GCA as a generator that aims at fooling a discriminator that labels dialogues as human-generated or machine-generated; however, in our approach, the discriminator performs token-level classification, i.e. it indicates whether the current token was generated by humans or machines. To do so, the discriminator also receives the context utterances (the dialogue history) and the incomplete answer up to the current token as input. This new approach makes possible the end-to-end training by backpropagation. A self-conversation process enables to produce a set of generated data with more diversity for the adversarial training. This approach improves the performance on questions not related to the training data. Experimental results with human and adversarial evaluations show that the adversarial method yields significant performance gains over the usual teacher forcing training.

除了新的GCA模型外，本文提出了一种新的生成性会话代理（GCA）的对抗学习方法。与之前关于对话生成的对抗性学习的研究类似，我们的方法假定GCA是一个生成器，其目的是欺骗一个将对话标记为人类生成或机器生成的鉴别器;然而，在我们的方法中，鉴别器执行令牌级分类，即它指示当前令牌是由人还是机器产生的。为此，鉴别器还接收上下文话语（对话历史）和直到当前令牌的不完整答案作为输入。这种新方法使反向传播的端到端培训成为可能。自我对话过程可以产生一组生成的对抗性更强的多样性数据。这种方法提高了与训练数据无关的问题的性能。人力和敌对评估的实验结果表明，敌对方法比通常的教师强迫训练产生显着的性能增益。
