##### Abstract
In the past few years, significant progress has been made on deep neural networks (DNNs) in achieving human-level intelligence on several long-standing tasks such as image classification, natural language processing, the ancient game of Go, etc. With broader deployment of DNNs on various applications, the concerns on its safety and trustworthiness have been raised, particularly after the fatal incidents of self-driving cars. Research to address these concerns is very active, with many papers released in the past few years. It is therefore infeasible, if not impossible, to cover all the research activities. This survey paper is to conduct a review of the current research efforts on making DNNs safe and trustworthy, by focusing on those works that are aligned with our humble visions about the safety and trustworthiness of DNNs. In total, we surveyed 178 papers, most of which were published in the most recent two years, i.e., 2017 and 2018.
