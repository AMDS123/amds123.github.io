##### Abstract
Clustering web documents has numerous applications, such as aggregating news articles into meaningful events, detecting trends and hot topics on the Web, preserving diversity in search results, etc. At the same time, the importance of named entities and, in particular, the ability to recognize them and to solve the associated co-reference resolution problem are widely recognized as key enabling factors when mining, aggregating and comparing content on the Web. Instead of considering these two problems separately, we propose in this paper a method that tackles jointly the problem of clustering news articles into events and cross-document co-reference resolution of named entities. The co-occurrence of named entities in the same clusters is used as an additional signal to decide whether two referents should be merged into one entity. These refined entities can in turn be used as enhanced features to re-cluster the documents and then be refined again, entering into a virtuous cycle that improves simultaneously the performances of both tasks. We implemented a prototype system and report results using the TDT5 collection of news articles, demonstrating the potential of our approach.

##### Abstract (translated by Google)
网络文档的聚类有许多应用，比如将新闻文章聚合成有意义的事件，检测Web上的趋势和热门话题，保持搜索结果的多样性等。同时，命名实体的重要性，特别是能力识别它们并解决相关的共同参考解决问题被广泛认为是在网络上挖掘，聚合和比较内容时的关键促成因素。我们不是分别考虑这两个问题，而是在本文中提出一种方法，将新闻文章聚类成事件和跨文件共命名实体的共同参考解决方案。在同一集群中同名的实体被用作附加信号来决定两个参照物是否应该被合并成一个实体。这些细化的实体可以反过来被用作增强的特征来重新聚合文档，然后再被细化，进入一个良性循环，同时改善两个任务的性能。我们实现了一个原型系统，并使用TDT5新闻报道收集报告结果，展示了我们的方法的潜力。
