##### Abstract
Extractive summarization and imbalanced multi-label classification often require vast amounts of training data to avoid overfitting. In situations where training data is expensive to generate, leveraging information between tasks is an attractive approach to increasing the amount of available information. This paper employs multi-task training of an extractive summarizer and an RNN-based classifier to improve summarization and classification accuracy by 50% and 75%, respectively, relative to RNN baselines. We hypothesize that concatenating sentence encodings based on document and class context increases generalizability for highly variable corpuses.
