##### Abstract
Generative Adversarial Networks are powerful generative models that are able to model the manifold of natural images. We leverage this property to perform manifold regularization by approximating a variant of the Laplacian norm using a Monte Carlo approximation that is easily computed with the GAN. When incorporated into the semi-supervised feature-matching GAN we achieve state-of-the-art results for GAN-based semi-supervised learning on CIFAR-10 and SVHN benchmarks, with a method that is significantly easier to implement than competing methods. We also find that manifold regularization improves the quality of generated images, and is affected by the quality of the GAN used to approximate the regularizer.

##### Abstract (translated by Google)
生成性对抗网络是强大的生成模型，能够模拟自然图像的多样性。我们利用该属性通过使用易于使用GAN计算的蒙特卡罗近似来近似拉普拉斯范数的变体来执行流形正则化。当结合到半监督的特征匹配GAN中时，我们在CIFAR-10和SVHN基准上实现了基于GAN的半监督学习的最先进结果，其方法比竞争方法更容易实现。我们还发现，流形正则化提高了生成图像的质量，并且受到用于近似正则化器的GAN质量的影响。
