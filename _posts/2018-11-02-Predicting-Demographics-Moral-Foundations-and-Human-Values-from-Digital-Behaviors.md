##### Abstract
Personal electronic devices such as smartphones give access to a broad range of behavioral signals that can be used to learn about the characteristics and preferences of individuals. In this study we explore the connection between demographic and psychological attributes and digital records for a cohort of 7,633 people, closely representative of the US population with respect to gender, age, geographical distribution, education, and income. We collected self-reported assessments on validated psychometric questionnaires based on both the Moral Foundations and Basic Human Values theories, and combined this information with passively-collected multi-modal digital data from web browsing behavior, smartphone usage and demographic data. Then, we designed a machine learning framework to infer both the demographic and psychological attributes from the behavioral data. In a cross-validated setting, our model is found to predict demographic attributes with good accuracy (weighted AUC scores of 0.90 for gender, 0.71 for age, 0.74 for ethnicity). Our weighted AUC scores for Moral Foundation attributes (0.66) and Human Values attributes (0.60) suggest that accurate prediction of complex psychometric attributes is more challenging but feasible. This connection might prove useful for designing personalized services, communication strategies, and interventions, and can be used to sketch a portrait of people with similar worldviews.
