##### Abstract
This paper presents the most comprehensive analysis of iris recognition reliability in the occurrence of various biological processes happening naturally and pathologically in the human body, including aging, illnesses, and post-mortem changes to date. Insightful conclusions are offered in relation to all three of these aspects. Extensive regression analysis of the template aging phenomenon shows that differences in pupil dilation, combined with certain quality factors of the sample image and the progression of time itself can significantly degrade recognition accuracy. Impactful effects can also be observed when iris recognition is employed with eyes affected by certain eye pathologies or (even more) with eyes of the deceased subjects. Notably, appropriate databases are delivered to the biometric community to stimulate further research in these utterly important areas of iris biometrics studies. Finally, some open questions are stated to inspire further discussions and research on these important topics. To Authors' best knowledge, this is the only scientific study of iris recognition reliability of such a broad scope and novelty.

本文介绍了虹膜识别可靠性在人体自然和病理发生的各种生物过程中的最全面分析，包括老化，疾病和迄今为止的死后变化。提供有关所有这三个方面的深刻见解。模板老化现象的广泛回归分析表明，瞳孔扩张的差异，结合样本图像的某些质量因素和时间本身的进展可以显着降低识别准确性。当虹膜识别用于受某些眼病变影响的眼睛或（甚至更多）用于已故受试者的眼睛时，也可以观察到有影响的效果。值得注意的是，适当的数据库被提供给生物识别界，以刺激虹膜生物识别研究这些极其重要的领域的进一步研究。最后，提出了一些开放性问题，以激发对这些重要主题的进一步讨论和研究。对于作者的最佳知识，这是虹膜识别可靠性如此广泛和新颖性的唯一科学研究。
