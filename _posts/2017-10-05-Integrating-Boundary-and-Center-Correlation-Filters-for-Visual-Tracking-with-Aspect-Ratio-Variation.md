##### Abstract
The aspect ratio variation frequently appears in visual tracking and has a severe influence on performance. Although many correlation filter (CF)-based trackers have also been suggested for scale adaptive tracking, few studies have been given to handle the aspect ratio variation for CF trackers. In this paper, we make the first attempt to address this issue by introducing a family of 1D boundary CFs to localize the left, right, top, and bottom boundaries in videos. This allows us cope with the aspect ratio variation flexibly during tracking. Specifically, we present a novel tracking model to integrate 1D Boundary and 2D Center CFs (IBCCF) where boundary and center filters are enforced by a near-orthogonality regularization term. To optimize our IBCCF model, we develop an alternating direction method of multipliers. Experiments on several datasets show that IBCCF can effectively handle aspect ratio variation, and achieves state-of-the-art performance in terms of accuracy and robustness.

纵横比变化频繁地出现在视觉跟踪中，并且对性能有严重的影响。虽然许多基于相关滤波器（CF）的跟踪器也被提出用于尺度自适应跟踪，但是已经很少研究处理CF跟踪器的纵横比变化。在本文中，我们首先尝试通过引入一维边界CF来对视频中的左，右，上，下边界进行本地化。这使我们能够在跟踪过程中灵活地处理宽高比变化。具体来说，我们提出了一种新的跟踪模型来整合一维边界和二维中心CF（IBCCF），其中边界和中心滤波器是通过近正交正则项来执行的。为了优化我们的IBCCF模型，我们开发了乘法器的交替方向方法。在几个数据集上的实验表明，IBCCF可以有效地处理宽高比变化，并且在精度和鲁棒性方面达到了最先进的性能。
