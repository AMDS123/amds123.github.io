##### Abstract
We present an end-to-end learning approach for motion deblurring, which is based on conditional GAN and content loss. It improves the state-of-the art in terms of peak signal-to-noise ratio, structural similarity measure and by visual appearance. The quality of the deblurring model is also evaluated in a novel way on a real-world problem -- object detection on (de-)blurred images. The method is 5 times faster than the closest competitor. Second, we present a novel method of generating synthetic motion blurred images from the sharp ones, which allows realistic dataset augmentation. Model, training code and dataset are available at this https URL

我们提出了一个基于条件GAN和内容丢失的运动去模糊的端到端学习方法。它在峰值信噪比，结构相似性测量和视觉外观方面改进了现有技术。在去模糊的图像上，还以现实世界的问题 - 对物体进行检测来评估去模型的质量。该方法比最接近的竞争对手快5倍。其次，我们提出了一种从清晰的图像生成合成运动模糊图像的新方法，它允许实际的数据集增强。模型，培训代码和数据集可在此https URL上获得
