##### Abstract
Languages shared by people differ in different regions based on their accents, pronunciation and word usages. In this era sharing of language takes place mainly through social media and blogs. Every second swing of such a micro posts exist which induces the need of processing those micro posts, in-order to extract knowledge out of it. Knowledge extraction differs with respect to the application in which the research on cognitive science fed the necessities for the same. This work further moves forward such a research by extracting semantic information of streaming and batch data in applications like Named Entity Recognition and Author Profiling. In the case of Named Entity Recognition context of a single micro post has been utilized and context that lies in the pool of micro posts were utilized to identify the sociolect aspects of the author of those micro posts. In this work Conditional Random Field has been utilized to do the entity recognition and a novel approach has been proposed to find the sociolect aspects of the author (Gender, Age group).

##### Abstract (translated by Google)
不同地区的人们所分享的语言根据其口音，发音和词语用法而有所不同。在这个时代，语言的共享主要通过社交媒体和博客进行。存在这样一个微型帖子的每一秒钟，这导致需要处理这些微型帖子，以便从中提取知识。知识提取的不同之处在于认知科学的研究为同样的需要提供了必要条件。这项工作进一步推进这样一个研究，通过提取应用程序中的流和批处理数据的语义信息，如命名实体识别和作者简介。在命名实体识别的情况下，利用单一微型职位的背景，利用微型职位池中的背景来确定这些微型职位作者的社会方面。在这项工作中，条件随机场已经被用来做实体识别，并提出了一种新的方法来找到作者（性别，年龄组）的社会方面。
