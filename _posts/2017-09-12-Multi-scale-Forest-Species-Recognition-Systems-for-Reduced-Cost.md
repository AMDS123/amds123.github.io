##### Abstract
This work focuses on cost reduction methods for forest species recognition systems. Current state-of-the-art shows that the accuracy of these systems have increased considerably in the past years, but the cost in time to perform the recognition of input samples has also increased proportionally. For this reason, in this work we focus on investigating methods for cost reduction locally (at either feature extraction or classification level individually) and globally (at both levels combined), and evaluate two main aspects: 1) the impact in cost reduction, given the proposed measures for it; and 2) the impact in recognition accuracy. The experimental evaluation conducted on two forest species datasets demonstrated that, with global cost reduction, the cost of the system can be reduced to less than 1/20 and recognition rates that are better than those of the original system can be achieved.

这项工作的重点是森林物种识别系统的成本降低方法。目前的现状表明，这些系统的准确性在过去几年中有了很大的提高，但是执行输入样本识别的时间成本也相应地增加了。因此，在这项工作中，我们侧重于调查降低本地成本的方法（无论是在特征提取还是在分类水平上）和全球（在两个层次上），并评估两个主要方面：1）降低成本的影响拟议的措施; 2）对识别准确性的影响。对两种森林物种数据集进行的实验评估表明，随着全球成本的降低，系统的成本可以降低到小于1/20，并且可以实现比原始系统更好的识别率。
