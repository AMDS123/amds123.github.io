##### Abstract
There is an ever growing need to ensure the quality of food and assess specific quality parameters in all the links of the food chain, ranging from processing, distribution and retail to preparing food. Various imaging and sensing technologies, including X-ray imaging, ultrasound, and near infrared reflectance spectroscopy have been applied to the problem. Cost and other constraints restrict the application of some of these technologies. In this study we test a novel Multiplexing Electric Field Sensor (MEFS), an approach that allows for a completely non-invasive and non-destructive testing approach. Our experiments demonstrate the reliable detection of certain foreign objects and provide evidence that this sensor technology has the capability of measuring fat content in minced meat. Given the fact that this technology can already be deployed at very low cost, low maintenance and in various different form factors, we conclude that this type of MEFS is an extremely promising technology for addressing specific food quality issues.

越来越需要确保食品质量并评估食品链各个环节的特定质量参数，从加工，分销和零售到准备食品。各种成像和传感技术，包括X射线成像，超声波和近红外反射光谱已应用于这个问题。成本和其他约束限制了这些技术中的一些的应用。在这项研究中，我们测试了一种新型多路复用电场传感器（MEFS），这种方法允许采用完全非侵入式和非破坏性的测试方法。我们的实验证明了对某些异物的可靠检测，并且证明这种传感器技术能够测量肉末中的脂肪含量。鉴于这项技术已经可以以非常低的成本，低维护和各种不同的外形因素进行部署，我们认为这种类型的MEFS是解决特定食品质量问题的极具前景的技术。
