##### Abstract
Due to its promising classification performance, sparse representation based classification(SRC) algorithm has attracted great attention in the past few years. However, the existing SRC type methods apply only to vector data in Euclidean space. As such, there is still no satisfactory approach to conduct classification task for symmetric positive definite (SPD) matrices which is very useful in computer vision. To address this problem, in this paper, a neighborhood preserved kernel SRC method is proposed on SPD manifolds. Specifically, by embedding the SPD matrices into a Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space (RKHS), the proposed method can perform classification on SPD manifolds through an appropriate Log-Euclidean kernel. Through exploiting the geodesic distance between SPD matrices, our method can effectively characterize the intrinsic local Riemannian geometry within data so as to well unravel the underlying sub-manifold structure. Despite its simplicity, experimental results on several famous database demonstrate that the proposed method achieves better classification results than the state-of-the-art approaches.

由于分类性能良好，近年来稀疏表示分类（SRC）算法引起了人们的高度重视。然而，现有的SRC类型方法仅适用于欧几里得空间中的矢量数据。因此，对于在计算机视觉中非常有用的对称正定（SPD）矩阵，还没有令人满意的方法来进行分类任务。针对这个问题，本文提出了一种SPD流形上的邻域保留核SRC方法。具体而言，通过将SPD矩阵嵌入到再生核希尔伯特空间（RKHS）中，所提出的方法可以通过适当的对数 - 欧几里德内核对SPD流形进行分类。通过利用SPD矩阵之间的测地距离，我们的方法可以有效地表征数据中的固有的局部黎曼几何，从而很好地解开潜在的子流形结构。尽管简单，但是在几个着名数据库上的实验结果表明，所提出的方法比现有技术方法获得更好的分类结果。
