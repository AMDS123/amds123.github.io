##### Abstract
Sensor-based activity recognition seeks the profound high-level knowledge about human activities from multitudes of low-level sensor readings. Conventional pattern recognition approaches have made tremendous progress in the past years. However, those methods often heavily rely on heuristic hand-crafted feature extraction, which could hinder their generalization performance. Additionally, existing methods are undermined for unsupervised and incremental learning tasks. Recently, the recent advancement of deep learning makes it possible to perform automatic high-level feature extraction thus achieves promising performance in many areas. Since then, deep learning based methods have been widely adopted for the sensor-based activity recognition tasks. This paper surveys the recent advance of deep learning based sensor-based activity recognition. We summarize existing literature from three aspects: sensor modality, deep model, and application. We also present detailed insights on existing work and propose grand challenges for future research.

##### Abstract (translated by Google)
基于传感器的活动识别通过大量的低级别传感器读数来寻求关于人类活动的深刻的高级知识。传统的模式识别方法在过去几年取得了巨大的进步。然而，这些方法往往严重依赖于启发式的手工特征提取，这可能会妨碍它们的泛化性能。另外，现有方法因无监督和增量学习任务而受到破坏。近来，深度学习的近期进展使得执行自动高级特征提取成为可能，从而在许多领域取得了有希望的性能。此后，基于深度学习的方法已经被广泛用于基于传感器的活动识别任务。本文考察了基于深度学习的传感器活动识别的最新进展。我们从传感器形态，深层模型和应用三个方面总结现有文献。我们还对现有的工作提出了详细的见解，并为未来的研究提出了重大挑战
