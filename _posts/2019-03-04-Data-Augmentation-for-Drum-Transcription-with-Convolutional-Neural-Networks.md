##### Abstract
A recurrent issue in deep learning is the scarcity of data, in particular precisely annotated data. Few publicly available databases are correctly annotated and generating correct labels is very time consuming. The present article investigates into data augmentation strategies for Neural Networks training, particularly for tasks related to drum transcription. These tasks need very precise annotations. This article investigates state-of-the-art sound transformation algorithms for remixing noise and sinusoidal parts, remixing attacks, transposing with and without time compensation and compares them to basic regularization methods such as using dropout and additive Gaussian noise. And it shows how a drum transcription algorithm based on CNN benefits from the proposed data augmentation strategy.
