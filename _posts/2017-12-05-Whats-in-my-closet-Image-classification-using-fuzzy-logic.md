##### Abstract
A fuzzy system was created in MATLAB to identify an item of clothing as a dress, shirt, or pair of pants from a series of input images. The system was initialized using a high-contrast vector-image of each item of clothing as the state closest to a direct solution. Nine other user-input images (three of each item) were also used to determine the characteristic function of each item and recognize each pattern. Mamdani inference systems were used for edge location and identification of characteristic regions of interest for each item of clothing. Based on these non-dimensional trends, a second Mamdani fuzzy inference system was used to characterize each image as containing a shirt, a dress, or a pair of pants. An outline of the fuzzy inference system and image processing techniques used for creating an image pattern recognition system are discussed.

##### Abstract (translated by Google)
在MATLAB中创建了一个模糊系统，用于从一系列输入图像中识别服装作为连衣裙，衬衫或裤子。系统使用每件衣服的高对比度矢量图像作为最接近直接解决方案的状态进行初始化。其他九个用户输入图像（每个项目三个）也被用来确定每个项目的特征函数并识别每个图案。 Mamdani推理系统用于每件衣服的感兴趣特征区域的边缘定位和识别。基于这些无量纲的趋势，第二个Mamdani模糊推理系统被用来表征每个图像包含一件衬衫，一条裙子或一条裤子。讨论了用于创建图像模式识别系统的模糊推理系统和图像处理技术的概况。
