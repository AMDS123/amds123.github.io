##### Abstract
Emojis are ideograms which are naturally combined with plain text to visually complement or condense the meaning of a message. Despite being widely used in social media, their underlying semantics have received little attention from a Natural Language Processing standpoint. In this paper, we investigate the relation between words and emojis, studying the novel task of predicting which emojis are evoked by text-based tweet messages. We train several models based on Long Short-Term Memory networks (LSTMs) in this task. Our experimental results show that our neural model outperforms two baselines as well as humans solving the same task, suggesting that computational models are able to better capture the underlying semantics of emojis.

表情符号是自然而然地与纯文本相结合的表意文字，用以在视觉上补充或压缩消息的含义。尽管在社交媒体中被广泛使用，但是从自然语言处理的角度来看，它们的底层语义却很少受到关注。在本文中，我们调查词与表情符号之间的关系，研究预测基于文本的推文消息引发哪些表情符号的新任务。我们在这个任务中训练了几个基于长期短期记忆网络（LSTMs）的模型。我们的实验结果表明，我们的神经模型胜过两个基线以及人类解决相同的任务，这表明计算模型能够更好地捕捉表情符号的底层语义。
