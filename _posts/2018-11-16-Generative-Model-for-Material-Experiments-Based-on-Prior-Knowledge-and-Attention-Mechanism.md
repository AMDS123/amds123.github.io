##### Abstract
Material irradiation experiment is dangerous and complex, thus it requires those with a vast advanced expertise to process the images and data manually. In this paper, we propose a generative adversarial model based on prior knowledge and attention mechanism to achieve the generation of irradiated material images (data-to-image model), and a prediction model for corresponding industrial performance (image-to-data model). With the proposed models, researchers can skip the dangerous and complex irradiation experiments and obtain the irradiation images and industrial performance parameters directly by inputing some experimental parameters only. We also introduce a new dataset ISMD which contains 22000 irradiated images with 22,143 sets of corresponding parameters. Our model achieved high quality results by compared with several baseline models. The evaluation and detailed analysis are also performed.
