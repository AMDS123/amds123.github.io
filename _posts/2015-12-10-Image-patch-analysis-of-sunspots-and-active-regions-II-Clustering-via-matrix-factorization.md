##### Abstract
Separating active regions that are quiet from potentially eruptive ones is a key issue in Space Weather applications. Traditional classification schemes such as Mount Wilson and McIntosh have been effective in relating an active region large scale magnetic configuration to its ability to produce eruptive events. However, their qualitative nature prevents systematic studies of an active region's evolution for example. We introduce a new clustering of active regions that is based on the local geometry observed in Line of Sight magnetogram and continuum images. We use a reduced-dimension representation of an active region that is obtained by factoring the corresponding data matrix comprised of local image patches. Two factorizations can be compared via the definition of appropriate metrics on the resulting factors. The distances obtained from these metrics are then used to cluster the active regions. We find that these metrics result in natural clusterings of active regions. The clusterings are related to large scale descriptors of an active region such as its size, its local magnetic field distribution, and its complexity as measured by the Mount Wilson classification scheme. We also find that including data focused on the neutral line of an active region can result in an increased correspondence between our clustering results and other active region descriptors such as the Mount Wilson classifications and the $R$ value. We provide some recommendations for which metrics, matrix factorization techniques, and regions of interest to use to study active regions.

分隔安静的潜在爆发的活动区域是空间天气应用中的关键问题。威尔逊山（Mount Wilson）和麦金托什（McIntosh）等传统分类方案在将活动区域大规模磁性配置与产生爆发性事件的能力相结合方面十分有效。然而，它们的定性性质阻碍了对活跃区域演化的系统研究。我们引入一个新的基于在视线磁场图和连续图像中观察到的局部几何形状的有源区域的聚类。我们使用通过分解由局部图像块组成的对应数据矩阵而获得的活动区域的降维表示。可以通过定义适当的度量标准来比较两个因子。然后使用从这些度量获得的距离来聚集活动区域。我们发现这些指标导致了活动区域的自然聚集。聚类与活动区域的大尺度描述符有关，例如其大小，局部磁场分布以及由威尔逊山分类方案测量的复杂度。我们还发现，将数据集中在活跃区域的中性线上，可以使我们的聚类结果与其他活动区域描述符（如Mount Wilson分类和$ R $值）之间的对应关系增加。我们提供了一些关于哪些指标，矩阵分解技术以及用于研究活动区域的感兴趣区域的建议。
