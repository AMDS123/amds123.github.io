##### Abstract
We review some practical and philosophical questions raised by the use of machine learning in creative practice. Beyond the obvious problems regarding plagiarism and authorship, we argue that the novelty in AI Art relies mostly on a narrow machine learning contribution : manifold approximation. Nevertheless, this contribution creates a radical shift in the way we have to consider this movement. Is this omnipotent tool a blessing or a curse for the artists?
