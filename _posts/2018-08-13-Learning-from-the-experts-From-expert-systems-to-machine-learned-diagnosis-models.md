##### Abstract
Expert diagnostic support systems have been extensively studied. The practical applications of these systems in real-world scenarios have been somewhat limited due to well-understood shortcomings, such as lack of extensibility. More recently, machine-learned models for medical diagnosis have gained momentum, since they can learn and generalize patterns found in very large datasets like electronic health records. These models also have shortcomings - in particular, there is no easy way to incorporate prior knowledge from existing literature or experts. In this paper, we present a method to merge both approaches by using expert systems as generative models that create simulated data on which models can be learned. We demonstrate that such a learned model not only preserves the original properties of the expert systems but also addresses some of their limitations. Furthermore, we show how this approach can also be used as the starting point to combine expert knowledge with knowledge extracted from other data sources, such as electronic health records.

专家诊断支持系统已得到广泛研究。这些系统在实际场景中的实际应用由于众所周知的缺点（例如缺乏可扩展性）而受到一定程度的限制。最近，用于医学诊断的机器学习模型已经获得了动力，因为它们可以学习和概括在诸如电子健康记录之类的非常大的数据集中发现的模式。这些模型也有缺点 - 特别是，没有简单的方法来结合现有文献或专家的先前知识。在本文中，我们提出了一种方法，通过使用专家系统作为生成模型来合并两种方法，创建可以学习模型的模拟数据。我们证明这种学习模型不仅保留了专家系统的原始属性，而且还解决了它们的一些局限性。此外，我们还展示了如何将此方法用作将专家知识与从其他数据源（如电子健康记录）中提取的知识相结合的起点。
