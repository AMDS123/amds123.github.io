##### Abstract
In this work we propose a method that geolocates videos within a delimited widespread area based solely on the frames visual content. Our proposed method tackles video-geolocation through traditional image retrieval techniques considering Google Street View as the reference point. To achieve this goal we use the deep learning features obtained from NetVLAD to represent images, since through this feature vectors the similarity is their L2 norm. In this paper, we propose a family of voting-based methods to aggregate frame-wise geolocation results which boost the video geolocation result. The best aggregation found through our experiments considers both NetVLAD and SIFT similarity, as well as the geolocation density of the most similar results. To test our proposed method, we gathered a new video dataset from Pittsburgh Downtown area to benefit and stimulate more work in this area. Our system achieved a precision of 90% while geolocating videos within a range of 150 meters or two blocks away from the original position.
