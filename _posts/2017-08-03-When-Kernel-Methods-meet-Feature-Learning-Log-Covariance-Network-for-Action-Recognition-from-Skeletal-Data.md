##### Abstract
Human action recognition from skeletal data is a hot research topic and important in many open domain applications of computer vision, thanks to recently introduced 3D sensors. In the literature, naive methods simply transfer off-the-shelf techniques from video to the skeletal representation. However, the current state-of-the-art is contended between to different paradigms: kernel-based methods and feature learning with (recurrent) neural networks. Both approaches show strong performances, yet they exhibit heavy, but complementary, drawbacks. Motivated by this fact, our work aims at combining together the best of the two paradigms, by proposing an approach where a shallow network is fed with a covariance representation. Our intuition is that, as long as the dynamics is effectively modeled, there is no need for the classification network to be deep nor recurrent in order to score favorably. We validate this hypothesis in a broad experimental analysis over 6 publicly available datasets.

来自骨骼数据的人类行为识别是一个热门的研究课题，在许多计算机视觉的开放领域应用中非常重要，这要归功于最近推出的3D传感器。在文献中，朴素的方法只是简单地将现成的技术从视频转换成骨架表示。然而，当前最先进的技术是在不同的范例之间进行竞争：基于核的方法和（循环）神经网络的特征学习。两种方法都表现出强劲的表现，但是它们表现出沉重而互补的缺点。受此事实的启发，我们的工作旨在通过提出一种浅层网络被赋予协方差表示的方法来将两种模式中最好的一种相结合。我们的直觉是，只要对动态进行有效建模，分类网络就没有必要深入或不经常地得分。我们在6个公开可用的数据集的广泛的实验分析中验证了这个假设。
