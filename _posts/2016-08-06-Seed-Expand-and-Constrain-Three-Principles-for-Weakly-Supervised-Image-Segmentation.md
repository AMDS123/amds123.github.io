##### Abstract
We introduce a new loss function for the weakly-supervised training of semantic image segmentation models based on three guiding principles: to seed with weak localization cues, to expand objects based on the information about which classes can occur in an image, and to constrain the segmentations to coincide with object boundaries. We show experimentally that training a deep convolutional neural network using the proposed loss function leads to substantially better segmentations than previous state-of-the-art methods on the challenging PASCAL VOC 2012 dataset. We furthermore give insight into the working mechanism of our method by a detailed experimental study that illustrates how the segmentation quality is affected by each term of the proposed loss function as well as their combinations.

针对语义图像分割模型的弱监督训练，引入了一种新的损失函数：基于弱定位线索的种子，基于图像中可能出现哪些类别的信息来扩展对象，并约束分割符合对象边界。我们通过实验显示，使用所提出的损失函数训练深度卷积神经网络导致比具有挑战性的PASCAL VOC 2012数据集上先前的先进方法更好的分割。通过详细的实验研究，我们进一步了解了我们的方法的工作机制，说明了分割质量如何受到所提出的损失函数的每个项以及它们的组合的影响。
