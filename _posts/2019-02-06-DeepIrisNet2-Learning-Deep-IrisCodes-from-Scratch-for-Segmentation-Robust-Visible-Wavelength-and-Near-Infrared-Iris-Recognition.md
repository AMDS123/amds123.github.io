##### Abstract
We first, introduce a deep learning based framework named as DeepIrisNet2 for visible spectrum and NIR Iris representation. The framework can work without classical iris normalization step or very accurate iris segmentation; allowing to work under non-ideal situation. The framework contains spatial transformer layers to handle deformation and supervision branches after certain intermediate layers to mitigate overfitting. In addition, we present a dual CNN iris segmentation pipeline comprising of a iris/pupil bounding boxes detection network and a semantic pixel-wise segmentation network. Furthermore, to get compact templates, we present a strategy to generate binary iris codes using DeepIrisNet2. Since, no ground truth dataset are available for CNN training for iris segmentation, We build large scale hand labeled datasets and make them public; i) iris, pupil bounding boxes, ii) labeled iris texture. The networks are evaluated on challenging ND-IRIS-0405, UBIRIS.v2, MICHE-I, and CASIA v4 Interval datasets. Proposed approach significantly improves the state-of-the-art and achieve outstanding performance surpassing all previous methods.
