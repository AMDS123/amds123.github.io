##### Abstract
Current self-driving car systems operate well in sunny weather but struggle in adverse conditions. One of the most commonly encountered adverse conditions involves water on the road caused by rain, sleet, melting snow or flooding. While some advances have been made in using conventional RGB camera and LIDAR technology for detecting water hazards, other sources of information such as polarization offer a promising and potentially superior approach to this problem in terms of performance and cost. In this paper, we present a novel stereo-polarization system for detecting and tracking water hazards based on polarization and color variation of reflected light, with consideration of the effect of polarized light from sky as function of reflection and azimuth angles. To evaluate this system, we present a new large `water on road' datasets spanning approximately 2 km of driving in various on-road and off-road conditions and demonstrate for the first time reliable water detection and tracking over a wide range of realistic car driving water conditions using polarized vision as the primary sensing modality. Our system successfully detects water hazards up to more than 100m. Finally, we discuss several interesting challenges and propose future research directions for further improving robust autonomous car perception in hazardous wet conditions using polarization sensors.

目前的自驾车系统在晴朗的天气下运行良好，但在恶劣的条件下也能正常工作最常遇到的不利条件之一就是雨水，雨雪，积雪融化等造成的道路积水。尽管在使用传统的RGB摄像机和LIDAR技术来检测水害方面取得了一些进展，但其他信息来源（如极化）在性能和成本方面为这个问题提供了有前途的和潜在的更好的方法。在本文中，我们提出了一种基于反射光的偏振和颜色变化来检测和跟踪水害的新型立体偏振系统，考虑了天空偏振光作为反射和方位角的作用。为了评估这个系统，我们提出了一个新的大型“水上道路”数据集，跨越约2公里的驾驶路况和越野条件，并首次证明了可靠的水检测和跟踪广泛的现实汽车以偏振视觉作为主要的传感方式来驱动水分条件。我们的系统能够成功地检测到高达100米以上的水害。最后，我们讨论了几个有趣的挑战，并提出了未来的研究方向，以进一步改善使用偏振传感器在危险潮湿条件下的鲁棒自主汽车感知。
