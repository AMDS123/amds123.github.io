##### Abstract
We examine the coincidence of times of high $\gamma$-ray flux and ejections of superluminal components from the core in EGRET blazars based on a VLBA monitoring program at 22 and 43 GHz from November 1993 to July 1997. In 23 cases of $\gamma$-ray flares for which sufficient VLBA data exist, 10 of the flares (in 8 objects) fall within 1$\sigma$ uncertainties of the extrapolated epoch of zero separation from the core of a superluminal radio component. In each of two sources (0528+134 and 1730-130) two successive $\gamma$-ray flares were followed by the appearance of new superluminal components. We carried out statistical simulations which show that if the number of coincidences $\ge$ 10 the radio and $\gamma$-ray events are associated with each other at >99.999% confidence. Our analysis of the observed behavior, including variability of the polarized radio flux, of the sources before, during, and after the $\gamma$-ray flares suggests that the $\gamma$-ray events occur in the superluminal radio knots. This implies that the $\gamma$-ray flares are caused by inverse Compton scattering by relativistic electrons in the parsec-scale regions of the jet rather than closer to the central engine.
