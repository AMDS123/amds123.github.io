##### Abstract
Object classification according to their shape and size is of key importance in many scientific fields. This work focuses on the case where the size and shape of an object is characterized by a current}. A current is a mathematical object which has been proved relevant to the modeling of geometrical data, like submanifolds, through integration of vector fields along them. As a consequence of the choice of a vector-valued Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space (RKHS) as a test space for integrating manifolds, it is possible to consider that shapes are embedded in this Hilbert Space. A vector-valued RKHS is a Hilbert space of vector fields; therefore, it is possible to compute a mean of shapes, or to calculate a distance between two manifolds. This embedding enables us to consider size-and-shape classification algorithms. These algorithms are applied to a 3D database obtained from an anthropometric survey of the Spanish child population with a potential application to online sales of children's wear.

根据其形状和大小进行对象分类在许多科学领域中是至关重要的。这项工作的重点在于一个对象的大小和形状是由一个当前}来表征的情况。电流是一个数学对象，已被证明与几何数据的建模相关，如子流形，通过沿它们的矢量场的积分。由于选择矢量值复制核希尔伯特空间（RKHS）作为集成流形的测试空间，可以考虑在这个希尔伯特空间中嵌入形状。矢量值RKHS是矢量场的希尔伯特空间;因此，可以计算形状的平均值，或计算两个歧管之间的距离。这种嵌入使我们能够考虑尺寸和形状分类算法。这些算法被应用于从西班牙儿童人口测量调查中获得的3D数据库，其可用于在线销售童装。
