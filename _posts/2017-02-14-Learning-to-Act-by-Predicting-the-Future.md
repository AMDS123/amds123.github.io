##### Abstract
We present an approach to sensorimotor control in immersive environments. Our approach utilizes a high-dimensional sensory stream and a lower-dimensional measurement stream. The cotemporal structure of these streams provides a rich supervisory signal, which enables training a sensorimotor control model by interacting with the environment. The model is trained using supervised learning techniques, but without extraneous supervision. It learns to act based on raw sensory input from a complex three-dimensional environment. The presented formulation enables learning without a fixed goal at training time, and pursuing dynamically changing goals at test time. We conduct extensive experiments in three-dimensional simulations based on the classical first-person game Doom. The results demonstrate that the presented approach outperforms sophisticated prior formulations, particularly on challenging tasks. The results also show that trained models successfully generalize across environments and goals. A model trained using the presented approach won the Full Deathmatch track of the Visual Doom AI Competition, which was held in previously unseen environments.

我们提出了一种在沉浸式环境中进行感觉运动控制的方法。我们的方法利用高维感官流和低维测量流。这些流的cotemporal结构提供了一个丰富的监督信号，这使得能够通过与环境交互来训练感觉运动控制模型。该模型是使用监督学习技术进行训练的，但不需要无关的监督。它学会根据来自复杂的三维环境的原始感官输入而行动。所提出的公式使得在训练时没有固定目标的学习，并且在测试时间追求动态变化的目标。我们在基于经典的第一人称游戏Doom的三维模拟中进行了广泛的实验。结果表明，提出的方法胜过先进的先验公式，特别是在具有挑战性的任务。结果还表明，训练有素的模型成功地推广了整个环境和目标。使用现有方法进行训练的模型赢得了在以前看不见的环境中举行的Visual Doom AI竞赛的Full Deathmatch轨迹。
