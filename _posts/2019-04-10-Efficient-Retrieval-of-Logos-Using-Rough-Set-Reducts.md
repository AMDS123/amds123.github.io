##### Abstract
Searching for similar logos in the registered logo database is a very important and tedious task at the trademark office. Speed and accuracy are two aspects that one must attend to while developing a system for retrieval of logos. In this paper, we propose a rough-set based method to quantify the structural information in a logo image that can be used to efficiently index an image. A logo is split into a number of polygons, and for each polygon, we compute the tight upper and lower approximations based on the principles of a rough set. This representation is used for forming feature vectors for retrieval of logos. Experimentation on a standard data set shows the usefulness of the proposed technique. It is computationally efficient and also provides retrieval results at high accuracy.
