##### Abstract
Photoplethysmography (PPG) devices are widely used for monitoring cardiovascular function. However, these devices require skin contact, which restrict their use to at-rest short-term monitoring using single-point measurements. Photoplethysmographic imaging (PPGI) has been recently proposed as a non-contact monitoring alternative by measuring blood pulse signals across a spatial region of interest. Existing systems operate in reflectance mode, of which many are limited to short-distance monitoring and are prone to temporal changes in ambient illumination. This paper is the first study to investigate the feasibility of long-distance non-contact cardiovascular monitoring at the supermeter level using transmittance PPGI. For this purpose, a novel PPGI system was designed at the hardware and software level using ambient correction via temporally coded illumination (TCI) and signal processing for PPGI signal extraction. Experimental results show that the processing steps yield a substantially more pulsatile PPGI signal than the raw acquired signal, resulting in statistically significant increases in correlation to ground-truth PPG in both short- ($p \in [<0.0001, 0.040]$) and long-distance ($p \in [<0.0001, 0.056]$) monitoring. The results support the hypothesis that long-distance heart rate monitoring is feasible using transmittance PPGI, allowing for new possibilities of monitoring cardiovascular function in a non-contact manner.

光电容积描记器（PPG）设备被广泛用于监测心血管功能。然而，这些装置需要皮肤接触，这限制了它们的使用，以便利用单点测量来进行静止的短期监测。光电容积脉搏波成像（PPGI）最近被提出作为一种非接触式监测替代方法，通过测量感兴趣空间区域的血脉信号。现有系统以反射模式操作，其中许多仅限于短距离监视，并且易于环境照明的时间变化。本文是首次应用透射比PPGI研究超远距离非接触式心血管监测的可行性。为此，通过时间编码照明（TCI）和PPGI信号提取的信号处理，在硬件和软件层面设计了一种新颖的PPGI系统。实验结果表明，处理步骤产生了比原始采集信号更多的脉动PPGI信号，从而在短时间内（p <0.0001,0.040）和远程（$ p <in [<0.0001，0.056] $）监控。结果支持这样的假设，即使用透射率PPGI进行远距离心率监测是可行的，从而允许以非接触方式监测心血管功能的新的可能性。
