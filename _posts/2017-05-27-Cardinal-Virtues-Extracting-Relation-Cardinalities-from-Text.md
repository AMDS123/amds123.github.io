##### Abstract
Information extraction (IE) from text has largely focused on relations between individual entities, such as who has won which award. However, some facts are never fully mentioned, and no IE method has perfect recall. Thus, it is beneficial to also tap contents about the cardinalities of these relations, for example, how many awards someone has won. We introduce this novel problem of extracting cardinalities and discusses the specific challenges that set it apart from standard IE. We present a distant supervision method using conditional random fields. A preliminary evaluation results in precision between 3% and 55%, depending on the difficulty of relations.

从文本中提取信息主要集中在单个实体之间的关系上，比如谁赢得了哪个奖项。然而，有些事实从来没有被完全提及过，没有IE方法具有完美的召回。因此，挖掘这些关系的基本内容也是有益的，例如，有人获得了多少奖项。我们介绍这个提取基数的新颖问题，并讨论与标准IE区别的具体挑战。我们提出了一个使用条件随机场的远程监督方法。根据关系的难易程度，初步评估结果的精确度在3％到55％之间。
