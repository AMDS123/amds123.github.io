##### Abstract
The increase in awareness of people towards their nutritional habits has drawn considerable attention to the field of automatic food analysis. Focusing on self-service restaurants environment, automatic food analysis is not only useful for extracting nutritional information from foods selected by customers, it is also of high interest to speed up the service solving the bottleneck produced at the cashiers in times of high demand. In this paper, we address the problem of automatic food tray analysis in canteens and restaurants environment, which consists in predicting multiple foods placed on a tray image. We propose a new approach for food analysis based on convolutional neural networks, we name Semantic Food Detection, which integrates in the same framework food localization, recognition and segmentation. We demonstrate that our method improves the state of the art food detection by a considerable margin on the public dataset UNIMIB2016 achieving about 90% in terms of F-measure, and thus provides a significant technological advance towards the automatic billing in restaurant environments.

人们对其营养习惯的认识的提高已经引起了对自动食品分析领域的相当大的关注。以自助式餐厅环境为中心，自动化食品分析不仅有助于从客户选择的食品中提取营养信息，而且加快解决高需求时收银员产生瓶颈的服务也很有意义。在本文中，我们解决了食堂和餐厅环境中食物托盘自动分析的问题，其中包括预测放在托盘图像上的多种食物。我们提出了一种基于卷积神经网络的食物分析新方法，我们命名为语义食物检测，它集成了食物定位，识别和分割的框架。我们证明，我们的方法在公共数据集UNIMIB2016上提高了食品检测的现状，在F-measure方面达到了约90％，从而为餐馆环境中的自动计费提供了显着的技术进步。
