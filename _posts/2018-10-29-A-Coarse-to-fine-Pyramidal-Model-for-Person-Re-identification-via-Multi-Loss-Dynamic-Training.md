##### Abstract
Most existing Re-IDentification (Re-ID) methods are highly dependent on precise bounding boxes that enable images to be aligned with each other. However, due to the inevitable challenging scenarios, current detection models often output inaccurate bounding boxes yet, which inevitably worsen the performance of these Re-ID algorithms. In this paper, to relax the requirement, we propose a novel coarse-to-fine pyramid model that not only incorporates local and global information, but also integrates the gradual cues between them. The pyramid model is able to match the cues at different scales and then search for the correct image of the same identity even when the image pair are not aligned. In addition, in order to learn discriminative identity representation, we explore a dynamic training scheme to seamlessly unify two losses and extract appropriate shared information between them. Experimental results clearly demonstrate that the proposed method achieves the state-of-the-art results on three datasets and it is worth noting that our approach exceeds the current best method by 9.5% on the most challenging dataset CUHK03.
