##### Abstract
Due to the world's demand for security systems, biometrics can be seen as an important topic of research in computer vision. One of the biometric forms that has been gaining attention is the recognition based on sclera. The initial and paramount step for performing this type of recognition is the segmentation of the region of interest, i.e. the sclera. In this context, two approaches for such task based on the Fully Convolutional Network (FCN) and on Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) are introduced in this work. FCN is similar to a common convolution neural network, however the fully connected layers (i.e., the classification layers) are removed from the end of the network and the output is generated by combining the output of pooling layers from different convolutional ones. The GAN is based on the game theory, where we have two networks competing with each other to generate the best segmentation. In order to perform fair comparison with baselines and quantitative and objective evaluations of the proposed approaches, we provide to the scientific community new 1,300 manually segmented images from two databases. The experiments are performed on the UBIRIS.v2 and MICHE databases and the best performing configurations of our propositions achieved F-score's measures of 87.48% and 88.32%, respectively.

由于世界对安全系统的需求，生物识别技术可被视为计算机视觉研究的重要课题。其中一种引起关注的生物识别形式是基于巩膜的识别。进行这种识别的最初和最重要的步骤是感兴趣区域即巩膜的分割。在这种情况下，在这项工作中引入了基于完全卷积网络（FCN）和生成对抗网络（GAN）的这种任务的两种方法。 FCN类似于普通的卷积神经网络，但是从网络的末端移除完全连接的层（即，分类层），并且通过组合来自不同卷积层的汇集层的输出来生成输出。 GAN基于博弈论，我们有两个网络相互竞争以产生最佳分割。为了与基线进行公平比较以及对拟议方法进行定量和客观评估，我们向科学界提供了来自两个数据库的新1,300个手动分段图像。实验在UBIRIS.v2和MICHE数据库上进行，我们命题的最佳表现配置分别达到了87.48％和88.32％的F-score测量值。
