##### Abstract
The problem of landmark recognition has achieved excellent results in small-scale datasets. When dealing with large-scale retrieval, issues that were irrelevant with small amount of data, quickly become fundamental for an efficient retrieval phase. In particular, computational time needs to be kept as low as possible, whilst the retrieval accuracy has to be preserved as much as possible. In this paper we propose a novel multi-index hashing method called Bag of Indexes (BoI) for Approximate Nearest Neighbors (ANN) search. It allows to drastically reduce the query time and outperforms the accuracy results compared to the state-of-the-art methods for large-scale landmark recognition. It has been demonstrated that this family of algorithms can be applied on different embedding techniques like VLAD and R-MAC obtaining excellent results in very short times on different public datasets: Holidays+Flickr1M, Oxford105k and Paris106k.

地标识别问题在小规模数据集中取得了很好的效果。在处理大规模检索时，与少量数据无关的问题迅速成为高效检索阶段的基础。特别是，计算时间需要尽可能低，而检索精度必须尽可能保持。在本文中，我们提出了一种新的多索引散列法，称为Bag of Indexes（BoI）用于近似最近邻（ANN）搜索。与大规模地标识别的最先进方法相比，它可以显着缩短查询时间并优于精确度结果。已经证明，这个算法家族可以应用于不同的嵌入技术，如VLAD和R-MAC，可以在很短的时间内在不同的公共数据集上获得极好的结果：Holidays + Flickr1M，Oxford105k和Paris106k。
