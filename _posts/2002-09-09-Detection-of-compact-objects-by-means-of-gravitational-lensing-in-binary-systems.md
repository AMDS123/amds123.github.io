##### Abstract
We consider the gravitational magnification of light for binary systems containing two compact objects: white dwarfs, a white dwarf and a neutron star or a white dwarf and a black hole. Light curves of the flares of the white dwarf caused by this effect were built in analytical approximations and by means of numerical calculations. We estimate the probability of the detection of these events in our Galaxy for different types of binaries and show that gravitational lensing provides a tool for detecting such systems. We propose to use the facilities of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) to search for these flares. It is possible to detect several dozens compact object pairs in such a programme over 5 years. This programme is apparently the best way to detect stellar mass black holes with open event horizons.

我们考虑包含两个紧凑物体的二元系统的光的引力放大：白矮星，白矮星，中子星，白矮星和黑洞。由这种效应引起的白矮星耀斑的光曲线建立在分析近似和数值计算的基础上。我们估计在银河系中发现这些事件的不同类型的二进制文件的可能性，并且显示引力透镜提供了检测这种系统的工具。我们建议使用斯隆数字巡天（SDSS）的设施搜寻这些耀斑。在这样的程序中，可以在5年内检测几十个紧凑的对象。这个程序显然是探测具有开放事件视界的恒星质量黑洞的最好方法。
