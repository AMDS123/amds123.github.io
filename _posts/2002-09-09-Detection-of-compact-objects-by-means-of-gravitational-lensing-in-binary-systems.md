##### Abstract
We consider the gravitational magnification of light for binary systems containing two compact objects: white dwarfs, a white dwarf and a neutron star or a white dwarf and a black hole. Light curves of the flares of the white dwarf caused by this effect were built in analytical approximations and by means of numerical calculations. We estimate the probability of the detection of these events in our Galaxy for different types of binaries and show that gravitational lensing provides a tool for detecting such systems. We propose to use the facilities of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) to search for these flares. It is possible to detect several dozens compact object pairs in such a programme over 5 years. This programme is apparently the best way to detect stellar mass black holes with open event horizons.
