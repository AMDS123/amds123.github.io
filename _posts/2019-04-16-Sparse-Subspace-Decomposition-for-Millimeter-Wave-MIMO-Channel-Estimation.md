##### Abstract
Millimeter wave multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) communication systems must operate over sparse wireless links and will require large antenna arrays to provide high throughput. To achieve sufficient array gains, these systems must learn and adapt to the channel state conditions. However, conventional MIMO channel estimation can not be directly extended to millimeter wave due to the constraints on cost-effective millimeter wave operation imposed on the number of available RF chains. Sparse subspace scanning techniques that search for the best subspace sample from the sounded subspace samples have been investigated for channel estimation.However, the performance of these techniques starts to deteriorate as the array size grows, especially for the hybrid precoding architecture. The millimeter wave channel estimation challenge still remains and should be properly addressed before the system can be deployed and used to its full potential. In this work, we propose a sparse subspace decomposition (SSD) technique for sparse millimeter wave MIMO channel estimation. We formulate the channel estimation as an optimization problem that minimizes the subspace distance from the received subspace samples. Alternating optimization techniques are devised to tractably handle the non-convex problem. Numerical simulations demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms other existing techniques with remarkably low overhead.
