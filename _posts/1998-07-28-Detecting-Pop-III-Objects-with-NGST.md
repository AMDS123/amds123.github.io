##### Abstract
We discuss some aspects concerning the formation and the impact of the first luminous structures in the universe (PopIIIs), with particular emphasis on their feedback effects on subsequent galaxy formation. We argue that supernovae in these objects might provide, if detected, important constraints for cosmological models. Some of these constraints come from the gravitational magnification of the supernova flux due to the intervening cosmological matter distribution which results in different predictions, for example, on rates, magnification probability, detection limits and number counts of distant supernovae. We show that NGST can tremendously contribute to such a study due to its advanced technological capabilities.
