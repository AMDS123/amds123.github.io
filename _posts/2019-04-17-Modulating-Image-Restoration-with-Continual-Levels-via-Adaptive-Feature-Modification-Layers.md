##### Abstract
In image restoration tasks, learning from discrete and fixed restoration levels, deep models cannot be easily generalized to data of continuous and unseen levels. We make a step forward by proposing a unified CNN framework that consists of few additional parameters than a single-level model yet could handle arbitrary restoration levels between a start and an end level. The additional module, namely AdaFM layer, performs channel-wise feature modification, and can adapt a model to another restoration level with high accuracy.
