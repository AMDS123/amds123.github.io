##### Abstract
First-principles investigations of the structural, electronic and magnetic properties of Cr-doped AlN/GaN (0001) heterostructures reveal that Cr segregates into the GaN region, that these interfaces retain their important half-metallic character and thus yield efficient (100 %) spin polarized injection from a ferromagnetic GaN:Cr electrode through an AlN tunnel barrier - whose height and width can be controlled by adjusting the Al concentration in the graded bandgap engineered Al(1-x)Ga(x)N (0001) layers.
