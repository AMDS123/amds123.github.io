##### Abstract
Memories in the brain are separated in two categories: short-term and long-term memories. Long-term memories remain for a lifetime, while short-term ones exist from a few milliseconds to a few minutes. Within short-term memory studies, there is debate about what neural structure could implement it. Indeed, mechanisms responsible for long-term memories appear inadequate for the task. Instead, it has been proposed that short-term memories could be sustained by the persistent activity of a group of neurons. In this work, we explore what topology could sustain short-term memories, not by designing a model from specific hypotheses, but through Darwinian evolution in order to obtain new insights into its implementation. We evolved 10 networks capable of retaining information for a fixed duration between 2 and 11s. Our main finding has been that the evolution naturally created two functional modules in the network: one which sustains the information containing primarily excitatory neurons, while the other, which is responsible for forgetting, was composed mainly of inhibitory neurons. This demonstrates how the balance between inhibition and excitation plays an important role in cognition.

大脑中的记忆分为两类：短期和长期记忆。长期的记忆是终生的，而短期的记忆则从几毫秒到几分钟。在短期记忆研究中，有关于什么神经结构可以实现的争论。事实上，负责长期记忆的机制似乎不足以完成这项任务。相反，有人提出短期记忆可以通过一组神经元的持续活动来维持。在这项工作中，我们探索什么拓扑结构可以维持短期记忆，而不是通过设计一个来自特定假设的模型，而是通过达尔文进化来获得对其实现的新见解。我们发展了10个能够在2到11秒之间保持信息的网络。我们的主要发现是，进化在网络中自然产生了两个功能模块：一个维持主要是兴奋性神经元的信息，另一个主要是抑制性神经元。这表明抑制与激发之间的平衡在认知中起着重要的作用。
