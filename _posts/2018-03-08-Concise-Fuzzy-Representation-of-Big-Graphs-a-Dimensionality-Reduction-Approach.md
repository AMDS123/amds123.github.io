##### Abstract
The enormous amount of data to be represented using large graphs exceeds in some cases the resources of a conventional computer. Edges in particular can take up a considerable amount of memory as compared to the number of nodes. However, rigorous edge storage might not always be essential to be able to draw the needed conclusions. A similar problem takes records with many variables and attempts to extract the most discernible features. It is said that the "dimension" of this data is reduced. Following an approach with the same objective in mind, we can map a graph representation to a k-dimensional space and answer queries of neighboring nodes by measuring Euclidean distances. The accuracy of our answers would decrease but would be compensated for by fuzzy logic which gives an idea about the likelihood of error. This method allows for reasonable representation in memory while maintaining a fair amount of useful information. Promising preliminary results are obtained and reported by testing the proposed approach on a number of Facebook graphs.

##### Abstract (translated by Google)
用大图表示的大量数据在某些情况下超过传统计算机的资源。与节点数量相比，边缘尤其会占用大量的内存。然而，严格的边缘存储可能并不总是能够得出所需结论的关键。类似的问题需要记录许多变量，并试图提取最明显的特征。据说这个数据的“维度”减少了。考虑到同一目标，我们可以将图表映射到k维空间，并通过测量欧几里得距离来回答相邻节点的查询。我们的答案的准确性会降低，但会被模糊逻辑所补偿，该模糊逻辑给出了错误可能性的概念。这种方法允许在保存大量有用信息的同时在内存中进行合理的表示。通过在许多Facebook图表上测试所提出的方法来获得有前途的初步结果并进行报告。
