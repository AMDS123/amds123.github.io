##### Abstract
In today's age of internet and social media, one can find an enormous volume of forged images on-line. These images have been used in the past to convey falsified information and achieve harmful intentions. The spread and the effect of the social media only makes this problem more severe. While creating forged images has become easier due to software advancements, there is no automated algorithm which can reliably detect forgery. Image forgery detection can be seen as a subset of image understanding problem. Human performance is still the gold-standard for these type of problems when compared to existing state-of-art automated algorithms. We conduct a subjective evaluation test with the aid of eye-tracker to investigate into human factors associated with this problem. We compare the performance of an automated algorithm and humans for forgery detection problem. We also develop an algorithm which uses the data from the evaluation test to predict the difficulty-level of an image (the difficulty-level of an image here denotes how difficult it is for humans to detect forgery in an image. Terms such as "Easy/difficult image" will be used in the same context). The experimental results presented in this paper should facilitate development of better algorithms in the future.

##### Abstract (translated by Google)
在当今互联网和社交媒体时代，人们可以在网上找到大量的伪造图像。过去这些图像被用来传达伪造的信息并达到有害的意图。社交媒体的传播和效果只会使这个问题更加严重。由于软件的进步，创建伪造的图像变得更加容易，但是没有可以可靠地检测伪造的自动算法。图像伪造检测可以看作是图像理解问题的一个子集。与现有的最先进的自动化算法相比，人类的性能仍然是这类问题的黄金标准。我们借助眼动仪进行主观评估测试，以调查与此问题相关的人为因素。我们比较自动算法和人为伪造检测问题的性能。我们还开发了一种算法，它使用评估测试的数据来预测图像的难度级别（这里图像的难度级别表示人类在图像中检测伪造的难度，例如“Easy /困难的形象“将在相同的情况下使用）。本文提出的实验结果将有助于将来开发更好的算法。
