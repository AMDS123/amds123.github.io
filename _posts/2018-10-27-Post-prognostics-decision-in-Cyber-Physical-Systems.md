##### Abstract
Prognostics and Health Management (PHM) offers several benefits for predictive maintenance. It predicts the future behavior of a system as well as its Remaining Useful Life (RUL). This RUL is used to planned the maintenance operation to avoid the failure, the stop time and optimize the cost of the maintenance and failure. However, with the development of the industry the assets are nowadays distributed this is why the PHM needs to be developed using the new IT. In our work we propose a PHM solution based on Cyber physical system where the physical side is connected to the analyze process of the PHM which are developed in the cloud to be shared and to benefit of the cloud characteristics
