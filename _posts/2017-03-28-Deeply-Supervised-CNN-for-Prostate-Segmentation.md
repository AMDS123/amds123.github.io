##### Abstract
Prostate segmentation from Magnetic Resonance (MR) images plays an important role in image guided interven- tion. However, the lack of clear boundary specifically at the apex and base, and huge variation of shape and texture between the images from different patients make the task very challenging. To overcome these problems, in this paper, we propose a deeply supervised convolutional neural network (CNN) utilizing the convolutional information to accurately segment the prostate from MR images. The proposed model can effectively detect the prostate region with additional deeply supervised layers compared with other approaches. Since some information will be abandoned after convolution, it is necessary to pass the features extracted from early stages to later stages. The experimental results show that significant segmentation accuracy improvement has been achieved by our proposed method compared to other reported approaches.

磁共振（MR）图像的前列腺分割在图像引导干预中起着重要的作用。但是，在顶点和底部缺乏明确的边界，不同患者的图像之间形状和纹理的巨大变化使得该任务非常具有挑战性。为了克服这些问题，本文提出了一种利用卷积信息对MR图像进行精确分割的深度监督卷积神经网络（CNN）。与其他方法相比，所提出的模型能够有效检测前列腺区域。由于卷积后会丢弃一些信息，因此有必要将从早期阶段提取的特征传递给后期阶段。实验结果表明，与其他报道的方法相比，我们提出的方法已经实现了显着的分割准确度改善。
