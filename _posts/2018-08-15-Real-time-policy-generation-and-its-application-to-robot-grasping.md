##### Abstract
Real time applications such as robotic require real time actions based on the immediate available data. Machine learning and artificial intelligence rely on high volume of training informative data set to propose a comprehensive and useful model for later real time action. Our goal in this paper is to provide a solution for robot grasping as a real time application without the time and memory consuming pertaining phase. Grasping as one of the most important ability of human being is defined as a suitable configuration which depends on the perceived information from the object. For human being, the best results obtain when one incorporates the vision data such as the extracted edges and shape from the object into grasping task. Nevertheless, in robotics, vision will not suite for every situation. Another possibility to grasping is using the object shape information from its vicinity. Based on these Haptic information, similar to human being, one can propose different approaches to grasping which are called grasping policies. In this work, we are trying to introduce a real time policy which aims at keeping contact with the object during movement and alignment on it. First we state problem by system dynamic equation incorporated by the object constraint surface into dynamic equation. In next step, the suggested policy to accomplish the task in real time based on the available sensor information will be presented. The effectiveness of proposed approach will be evaluated by demonstration results.

机器人等实时应用程序需要基于即时可用数据的实时操作。机器学习和人工智能依赖于大量的培训信息数据集，以便为以后的实时行动提出全面而有用的模型。我们在本文中的目标是提供一种机器人抓取作为实时应用程序的解决方案，而无需耗费时间和内存消耗。把握作为人类最重要的能力之一被定义为一种合适的配置，它取决于来自物体的感知信息。对于人类而言，当将一个视觉数据（例如从对象中提取的边缘和形状）合并到抓取任务中时，获得最佳结果。然而，在机器人技术中，视觉不适合所有情况。另一种抓取的可能性是使用来自其附近的物体形状信息。基于这些与人类相似的触觉信息，人们可以提出不同的抓取方法，这些方法称为抓取策略。在这项工作中，我们试图引入一个实时政策，旨在在运动和对齐过程中保持与物体的接触。首先，我们通过对象约束表面结合到动力学方程中的系统动力学方程来陈述问题。在下一步中，将呈现基于可用传感器信息实时完成任务的建议策略。拟议方法的有效性将通过示范结果进行评估。
