##### Abstract
In this paper, we propose new accelerated update rules for rank-constrained spatial covariance model estimation, which efficiently extracts a directional target source in diffuse background noise.The naive updat e rule requires heavy computation such as matrix inversion or matrix multiplication. We resolve this problem by expanding matrix inversion to reduce computational complexity; in the parameter update step, we need neither matrix inversion nor multiplication. In an experiment, we show that the proposed accelerated update rule achieves 87 times faster calculation than the naive one.
