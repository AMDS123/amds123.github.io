##### Abstract
In this paper, we propose a new type of graph, denoted as "embedded-graph", and its theory, which employs a distributed representation to describe the relations on the graph edges. Embedded-graphs can express linguistic and complicated relations, which cannot be expressed by the existing edge-graphs or weighted-graphs. We introduce the mathematical definition of embedded-graph, translation, edge distance, and graph similarity. We can transform an embedded-graph into a weighted-graph and a weighted-graph into an edge-graph by the translation method and by threshold calculation, respectively. The edge distance of an embedded-graph is a distance based on the components of a target vector, and it is calculated through cosine similarity with the target vector. The graph similarity is obtained considering the relations with linguistic complexity. In addition, we provide some examples and data structures for embedded-graphs in this paper.

##### Abstract (translated by Google)
在本文中，我们提出了一种新型的图，表示为“嵌入图”，其理论采用分布式表示来描述图边上的关系。嵌入图可以表达语言和复杂关系，不能用现有的边缘图或加权图表示。我们介绍嵌入图的数学定义，平移，边距和图相似度。我们可以通过平移方法和阈值计算分别将嵌入图转换成加权图和加权图成边缘图。嵌入图的边缘距离是基于目标矢量的分量的距离，通过与目标矢量的余弦相似度来计算。考虑到与语言复杂性的关系，得到图的相似度。另外，本文给出了嵌入图的一些实例和数据结构。
