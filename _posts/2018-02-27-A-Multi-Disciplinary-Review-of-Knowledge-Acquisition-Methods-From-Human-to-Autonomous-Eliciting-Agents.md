##### Abstract
This paper offers a multi-disciplinary review of knowledge acquisition methods in human activity systems. The review captures the degree of involvement of various types of agencies in the knowledge acquisition process, and proposes a classification with three categories of methods: the human agent, the human-inspired agent, and the autonomous machine agent methods. In the first two categories, the acquisition of knowledge is seen as a cognitive task analysis exercise, while in the third category knowledge acquisition is treated as an autonomous knowledge-discovery endeavour. The motivation for this classification stems from the continuous change over time of the structure, meaning and purpose of human activity systems, which are seen as the factor that fuelled researchers' and practitioners' efforts in knowledge acquisition for more than a century. 
 We show through this review that the KA field is increasingly active due to the higher and higher pace of change in human activity, and conclude by discussing the emergence of a fourth category of knowledge acquisition methods, which are based on red-teaming and co-evolution.

本文提供了对人类活动系统中知识获取方法的多学科综述。该评论捕捉了各类机构在知识获取过程中的参与程度，并提出了三种方法的分类：人类代理，人为启发代理和自主机器代理方法。在前两类中，知识获取被视为一种认知任务分析练习，而在第三类知识获取被视为一项自主的知识发现努力。这种分类的动机源于人类活动系统的结构，意义和目的随着时间的推移不断变化，这被认为是推动研究人员和从业者在超过一个世纪的知识获取方面的努力的因素。
 我们通过这篇综述显示，由于人类活动变化的速度越来越快，KA领域越来越活跃，最后讨论了第四类知识获取方法的出现，这些知识获取方法是基于红色团队合作的，演化。
