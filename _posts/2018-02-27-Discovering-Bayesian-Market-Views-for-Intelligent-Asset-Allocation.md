##### Abstract
Along with the advance of opinion mining techniques, public mood has been found to be a key element for stock market prediction. However, in what manner the market participants are affected by public mood has been rarely discussed. As a result, there has been little progress in leveraging public mood for the asset allocation problem, as the application is preferred in a trusted and interpretable way. In order to address the issue of incorporating public mood analyzed from social media, we propose to formalize it into market views that can be integrated into the modern portfolio theory. In this framework, the optimal market views will maximize returns in each period with a Bayesian asset allocation model. We train two neural models to generate the market views, and benchmark the performance of our model using market views on other popular asset allocation strategies. Our experimental results suggest that the formalization of market views significantly increases the profitability (5% to 10%) of the simulated portfolio at a given risk level.

随着意见挖掘技术的进步，公众情绪已被发现是股市预测的关键因素。然而，市场参与者受到公众情绪影响的方式很少被讨论。因此，利用公共情绪来解决资产配置问题的进展甚微，因为该申请是以受信任和可解释的方式受到欢迎的。为了解决从社交媒体中分析公众情绪的问题，我们建议将其形式化为市场观点，并将其融入现代投资组合理论。在这个框架下，最佳市场观点将使贝叶斯资产配置模型在每个时期的收益最大化。我们训练两个神经模型以产生市场观点，并使用其他常用资产分配策略的市场观点来对我们模型的表现进行基准测试。我们的实验结果表明，市场观点的形式化显着提高了模拟投资组合在给定风险水平下的盈利能力（5​​％至10％）。
