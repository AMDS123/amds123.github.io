##### Abstract
Gait analysis is the study of the systematic methods that assess and quantify animal locomotion. The research on gait analysis has considerably evolved through time. It was an ancient art, and it still finds its application today in modern science and medicine. This paper describes how one's gait can be used as a biometric. It shall diversely cover salient research done within the field and explain the nuances and advances in each type of gait analysis. The prominent methods of gait recognition from the early era to the state of the art are covered. This survey also reviews the various gait datasets. The overall aim of this study is to provide a concise roadmap for anyone who wishes to do research in the field of gait biometrics.
