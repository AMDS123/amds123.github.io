##### Abstract
Machine-learning excels in many areas with well-defined goals. However, a clear goal is usually not available in art forms, such as photography. The success of a photograph is measured by its aesthetic value, a very subjective concept. This adds to the challenge for a machine learning approach. We introduce Creatism, a deep-learning system for artistic content creation. In our system, we break down aesthetics into multiple aspects, each can be learned individually from a shared dataset of professional examples. Each aspect corresponds to an image operation that can be optimized efficiently. A novel editing tool, dramatic mask, is introduced as one operation that improves dramatic lighting for a photo. Our training does not require a dataset with before/after image pairs, or any additional labels to indicate different aspects in aesthetics. Using our system, we mimic the workflow of a landscape photographer, from framing for the best composition to carrying out various post-processing operations. The environment for our virtual photographer is simulated by a collection of panorama images from Google Street View. We design a "Turing-test"-like experiment to objectively measure quality of its creations, where professional photographers rate a mixture of photographs from different sources blindly. Experiments show that a portion of our robot's creation can be confused with professional work.

机器学习在许多领域都有明确的目标。但是，摄影等艺术形式往往没有明确的目标。照片的成功是通过其审美价值来衡量的，这是一个非常主观的概念。这增加了机器学习方法的挑战。我们介绍创造力，一个艺术内容创作的深度学习系统。在我们的系统中，我们把美学分解成多个方面，每一个都可以从一个专业的例子的共享数据集中单独学习。每个方面对应于可以有效优化的图像操作。引入了一种新颖的编辑工具，戏剧性的面具，可以改善照片的戏剧性照明。我们的训练不需要包含前/后图像对的数据集，也不需要任何附加标签来指示美学的不同方面。使用我们的系统，我们模仿风景摄影师的工作流程，从构图的最佳组合到执行各种后期处理操作。我们的虚拟摄影师的环境是由谷歌街景全景图像集合模拟。我们设计了一个“图灵测试”式的实验来客观地测量其创作的质量，专业摄影师盲目地对不同来源的照片进行混合处理。实验表明，我们机器人创作的一部分可能会与专业工作混淆。
