##### Abstract
Image alignment across domains has recently become one of the realistic and popular topics in the research community. In this problem, a deep learning-based image alignment method is usually trained on an available largescale database. During the testing steps, this trained model is deployed on unseen images collected under different camera conditions and modalities. The delivered deep network models are unable to be updated, adapted or fine-tuned in these scenarios. Thus, recent deep learning techniques, e.g. domain adaptation, feature transferring, and fine-tuning, are unable to be deployed. This paper presents a novel deep learning based approach to tackle the problem of across unseen modalities. The proposed network is then applied to image alignment as an illustration. The proposed approach is designed as an end-to-end deep convolutional neural network to optimize the deep models to improve the performance. The proposed network has been evaluated in digit recognition when the model is trained on MNIST and then tested on unseen domain MNIST-M. Finally, the proposed method is benchmarked in image alignment problem when training on RGB images and testing on Depth and X-Ray images.
