##### Abstract
The importance of a research article is routinely measured by counting how many times it has been cited. However, treating all citations with equal weight ignores the wide variety of functions that citations perform. We want to automatically identify the subset of references in a bibliography that have a central academic influence on the citing paper. For this purpose, we examine the effectiveness of a variety of features for determining the academic influence of a citation. By asking authors to identify the key references in their own work, we created a data set in which citations were labeled according to their academic influence. Using automatic feature selection with supervised machine learning, we found a model for predicting academic influence that achieves good performance on this data set using only four features. The best features, among those we evaluated, were those based on the number of times a reference is mentioned in the body of a citing paper. The performance of these features inspired us to design an influence-primed h-index (the hip-index). Unlike the conventional h-index, it weights citations by how many times a reference is mentioned. According to our experiments, the hip-index is a better indicator of researcher performance than the conventional h-index.

##### Abstract (translated by Google)
研究文章的重要性通过计算被引用的次数进行定期衡量。然而，以相同的权重处理所有的引用忽略了引用所执行的各种功能。我们希望在参考文献中自动识别对参考文献具有中心学术影响力的参考文献。为此，我们研究了确定引用的学术影响力的各种特征的有效性。通过要求作者在他们自己的工作中找出关键参考，我们创建了一个数据集，根据他们的学术影响力对引用进行标记。通过监督机器学习的自动特征选择，我们找到了一个预测学术影响力的模型，该模型仅使用四个特征就可以在这个数据集上获得良好的性能。我们评估的最好的特点是基于引用文献中引用参考文献的次数。这些特征的表现启发了我们设计了一个有影响力的h指数（髋指数）。与传统的H指数不同，它通过提及参考的次数对引用进行加权。根据我们的实验，髋关节指数是比传统的h指数更好的研究者表现指标。
