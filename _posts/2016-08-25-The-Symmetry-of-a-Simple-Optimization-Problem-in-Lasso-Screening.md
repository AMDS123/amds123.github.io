##### Abstract
Recently dictionary screening has been proposed as an effective way to improve the computational efficiency of solving the lasso problem, which is one of the most commonly used method for learning sparse representations. To address today's ever increasing large dataset, effective screening relies on a tight region bound on the solution to the dual lasso. Typical region bounds are in the form of an intersection of a sphere and multiple half spaces. One way to tighten the region bound is using more half spaces, which however, adds to the overhead of solving the high dimensional optimization problem in lasso screening. This paper reveals the interesting property that the optimization problem only depends on the projection of features onto the subspace spanned by the normals of the half spaces. This property converts an optimization problem in high dimension to much lower dimension, and thus sheds light on reducing the computation overhead of lasso screening based on tighter region bounds.

最近，字典筛选被提出作为提高解决套索问题的计算效率的有效方法，套索问题是学习稀疏表示最常用的方法之一。为了解决当今日益增长的大型数据集，有效的筛选依赖于双套索解决方案的一个紧密区域。典型的区域边界是球体和多个半空间相交的形式。收紧区域边界的一种方法是使用更多的半空间，然而这增加了解决套索筛选中的高维优化问题的开销。本文揭示了一个有趣的性质，即最优化问题仅仅依赖于特征投影到半空间法向所涵盖的子空间上。该属性将高维优化问题转化为更低维度，从而减少基于更严格区域边界的套索筛选的计算开销。
