##### Abstract
- Both Lidars and Radars are sensors for obstacle detection. While Lidars are very accurate on obstacles positions and less accurate on their velocities, Radars are more precise on obstacles velocities and less precise on their positions. Sensor fusion between Lidar and Radar aims at improving obstacle detection using advantages of the two sensors. The present paper proposes a real-time Lidar/Radar data fusion algorithm for obstacle detection and tracking based on the global nearest neighbour standard filter (GNN). This algorithm is implemented and embedded in an automative vehicle as a component generated by a real-time multisensor software. The benefits of data fusion comparing with the use of a single sensor are illustrated through several tracking scenarios (on a highway and on a bend) and using real-time kinematic sensors mounted on the ego and tracked vehicles as a ground truth.

 - 激光雷达和雷达都是用于障碍物检测的传感器。虽然激光雷达在障碍物位置上非常准确并且速度不太准确，但雷达在障碍物速度上更精确，在位置上更精确。激光雷达和雷达之间的传感器融合旨在利用两个传感器的优势改善障碍物检测。本文提出了一种基于全局最近邻标准滤波器（GNN）的用于障碍物检测和跟踪的实时激光雷达/雷达数据融合算法。该算法被实现并嵌入在自动车辆中，作为由实时多传感器软件生成的组件。数字融合的优势与单个传感器的使用相比，通过几种跟踪方案（在高速公路上和弯道上）以及使用安装在自我和履带式车辆上的实时运动传感器作为基本事实来说明。
