##### Abstract
In this work, we present a comparison between two techniques of image compression. In the first case, the image is divided in blocks which are collected according to zig-zag scan. In the second one, we apply the Fast Cosine Transform to the image, and then the transformed image is divided in blocks which are collected according to zig-zag scan too. Later, in both cases, the Karhunen-Loeve transform is applied to mentioned blocks. On the other hand, we present three new metrics based on eigenvalues for a better comparative evaluation of the techniques. Simulations show that the combined version is the best, with minor Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Mean Squared Error (MSE), higher Peak Signal to Noise Ratio (PSNR) and better image quality. Finally, new technique was far superior to JPEG and JPEG2000.

在这项工作中，我们介绍两种图像压缩技术的比较。在第一种情况下，图像被分割成根据之字形扫描收集的块。第二种方法是对图像进行快速余弦变换，然后将变换后的图像按锯齿扫描方式进行分块。之后，在这两种情况下，Karhunen-Loeve变换适用于上述块。另一方面，我们提出了三个基于特征值的新指标，以更好地比较评估技术。仿真表明，组合版本是最好的，具有较小的平均绝对误差（MAE）和均方差（MSE），较高的峰值信噪比（PSNR）和较好的图像质量。最后，新技术远远优于JPEG和JPEG2000。
