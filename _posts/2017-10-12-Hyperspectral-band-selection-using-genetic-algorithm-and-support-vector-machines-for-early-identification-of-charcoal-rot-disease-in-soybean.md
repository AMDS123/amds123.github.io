##### Abstract
Charcoal rot is a fungal disease that thrives in warm dry conditions and affects the yield of soybeans and other important agronomic crops worldwide. There is a need for robust, automatic and consistent early detection and quantification of disease symptoms which are important in breeding programs for the development of improved cultivars and in crop production for the implementation of disease control measures for yield protection. Current methods of plant disease phenotyping are predominantly visual and hence are slow and prone to human error and variation. There has been increasing interest in hyperspectral imaging applications for early detection of disease symptoms. However, the high dimensionality of hyperspectral data makes it very important to have an efficient analysis pipeline in place for the identification of disease so that effective crop management decisions can be made. The focus of this work is to determine the minimal number of most effective hyperspectral bands that can distinguish between healthy and diseased specimens early in the growing season. Healthy and diseased hyperspectral data cubes were captured at 3, 6, 9, 12, and 15 days after inoculation. We utilized inoculated and control specimens from 4 different genotypes. Each hyperspectral image was captured at 240 different wavelengths in the range of 383 to 1032 nm. We used a combination of genetic algorithm as an optimizer and support vector machines as a classifier for identification of maximally effective band combinations. A binary classification between healthy and infected samples using six selected band combinations obtained a classification accuracy of 97% and a F1 score of 0.97 for the infected class. The results demonstrated that these carefully chosen bands are more informative than RGB images, and could be used in a multispectral camera for remote identification of charcoal rot infection in soybean.

木炭腐病是一种真菌病害，在温暖的干燥条件下繁衍，影响全球大豆和其他重要农作物的产量。需要对疾病症状进行稳健，自动和一致的早期检测和量化，这对于开发改良品种和作物生产的育种计划是重要的，以实施用于产量保护的疾病控制措施。目前的植物病害表型分析方法主要是视觉方法，因此速度慢，容易出现人为误差和变异。高光谱成像应用对早期发现疾病症状的兴趣日益增加。然而，高光谱数据的高维度使得有一个有效的分析流水线来确定疾病是十分重要的，因此可以作出有效的作物管理决策。这项工作的重点是确定在生长季节早期能够区分健康和患病标本的最有效的高光谱带的最小数量。在接种后的第3,6,9,12和15天捕获健康和患病的高光谱数据立方体。我们利用来自4个不同基因型的接种和对照样本。每个高光谱图像在383到1032nm范围内的240个不同波长被捕获。我们使用了遗传算法作为优化器和支持向量机的组合作为识别最大有效频带组合的分类器。使用六个选定的条带组合的健康和感染样本之间的二元分类获得了97％的分类准确度和0.97的受感染类别的F1分数。结果表明，这些精心挑选的条带比RGB图像更具信息性，可用于多光谱相机远程识别大豆炭腐病的感染。
