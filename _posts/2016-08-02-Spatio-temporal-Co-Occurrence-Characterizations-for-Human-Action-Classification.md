##### Abstract
The human action classification task is a widely researched topic and is still an open problem. Many state-of-the-arts approaches involve the usage of bag-of-video-words with spatio-temporal local features to construct characterizations for human actions. In order to improve beyond this standard approach, we investigate the usage of co-occurrences between local features. We propose the usage of co-occurrences information to characterize human actions. A trade-off factor is used to define an optimal trade-off between vocabulary size and classification rate. Next, a spatio-temporal co-occurrence technique is applied to extract co-occurrence information between labeled local features. Novel characterizations for human actions are then constructed. These include a vector quantized correlogram-elements vector, a highly discriminative PCA (Principal Components Analysis) co-occurrence vector and a Haralick texture vector. Multi-channel kernel SVM (support vector machine) is utilized for classification. For evaluation, the well known KTH as well as the challenging UCF-Sports action datasets are used. We obtained state-of-the-arts classification performance. We also demonstrated that we are able to fully utilize co-occurrence information, and improve the standard bag-of-video-words approach.

人类行为分类任务是一个广为研究的课题，仍然是一个悬而未决的问题。许多现代技术方法涉及使用具有时空局部特征的视频词组来构建人类行为的表征。为了改进这种标准方法，我们调查了地方特征之间共现的用法。我们建议使用共现信息来表征人类行为。使用折衷因子来定义词汇大小和分类率之间的最佳折衷。接下来，应用时空共现技术来提取标记的局部特征之间的共现信息。然后构建人类行为的新颖表征。这些包括矢量量化相关图元素矢量，高判别性PCA（主成分分析）共现矢量和Haralick纹理矢量。利用多通道核SVM（支持向量机）进行分类。为了评估，使用众所周知的KTH以及具有挑战性的UCF-Sports动作数据集。我们获得了最先进的分类表现。我们还表明，我们能够充分利用共现信息，并改进标准视频词汇的方法。
