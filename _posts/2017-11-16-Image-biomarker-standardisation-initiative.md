##### Abstract
While analysis of medical images has practically taken place since the first image was recorded, high throughput analysis of medical images is a more recent phenomenon. The aim of such a radiomics process is to provide decision support based on medical imaging. Part of the radiomics process is the conversion of image data into numerical features which capture different medical image aspects, and can be subsequently correlated as biomarkers to e.g. expected oncological treatment outcome. With the growth of the radiomics field, it has become clear that results are often difficult to reproduce, that standards for image processing and feature extraction are missing, and that reporting guidelines are absent. The image biomarker standardisation initiative (IBSI) seeks to address these issues. The current document provides definitions for a large number of image features as well as common image processing elements.

从记录第一张图像开始，医学图像的分析实际上已经发生，医学图像的高吞吐量分析是更近期的现象。这种无线电组学的目标是提供基于医学成像的决策支持。部分基因组学过程是将图像数据转换为捕获不同医学图像方面的数字特征，并且随后可以将其作为生物标记与例如预期肿瘤治疗结果。随着无线电领域的发展，结果往往难以复制，缺乏图像处理和特征提取的标准，缺乏报告指南。图像生物标志物标准化倡议（IBSI）试图解决这些问题。当前文档提供了大量图像特征的定义以及常见的图像处理元素。
