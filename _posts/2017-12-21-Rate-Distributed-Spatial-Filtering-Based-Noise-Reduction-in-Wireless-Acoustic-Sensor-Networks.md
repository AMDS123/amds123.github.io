##### Abstract
In wireless acoustic sensor networks (WASNs), sensors typically have a limited energy budget as they are often battery driven. Energy efficiency is therefore essential to the design of algorithms in WASNs. One way to reduce energy costs is to only select the sensors which are most informative, a problem known as {\it sensor selection}. In this way, only sensors that significantly contribute to the task at hand will be involved. In this work, we consider a more general approach, which is based on rate-distributed spatial filtering. Together with the distance over which transmission takes place, bit rate directly influences the energy consumption. We try to minimize the battery usage due to transmission, while constraining the noise reduction performance. This results in an efficient rate allocation strategy, which depends on the underlying signal statistics, as well as the distance from sensors to a fusion center (FC). Under the utilization of a linearly constrained minimum variance (LCMV) beamformer, the problem is derived as a semi-definite program. Furthermore, we show that rate allocation is more general than sensor selection, and sensor selection can be seen as a special case of the presented rate-allocation solution, e.g., the best microphone subset can be determined by thresholding the rates. Finally, numerical simulations for the application of estimating several target sources in a WASN demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms the microphone subset selection based approaches in the sense of energy usage, and we find that the sensors close to the FC and close to point sources are allocated with higher rates.

在无线声学传感器网络（WASN）中，传感器通常具有有限的能量预算，因为它们通常是电池驱动的。因此，能效对于WASN算法的设计至关重要。降低能源成本的一种方法是仅选择信息最多的传感器，这是一个被称为{传感器选择}的问题。通过这种方式，只有那些对手头任务有重大贡献的传感器才会参与进来。在这项工作中，我们考虑一个更一般的方法，它是基于速率分布的空间滤波。与传输发生的距离一起，比特率直接影响能量消耗。我们尽量减少由于传输造成的电池使用量，同时限制降噪性能。这导致有效的速率分配策略，其取决于基础信号统计，以及从传感器到聚变中心（FC）的距离。在利用线性约束最小方差（LCMV）波束形成器的情况下，该问题被推导为半确定程序。此外，我们表明速率分配比传感器选择更一般化，并且传感器选择可以被看作是所提出的速率分配解决方案的特例，例如，可以通过阈值速率来确定最佳麦克风子集。最后，在WASN中估计多个目标源的应用的数值模拟表明，所提出的方法在能量使用意义上优于基于麦克风子集选择的方法，并且我们发现接近FC和接近点源的传感器是分配更高的利率。
