##### Abstract
We have developed a convolutional neural network for the purpose of recognizing facial expressions in human beings. We have fine-tuned the existing convolutional neural network model trained on the visual recognition dataset used in the ILSVRC2012 to two widely used facial expression datasets - CFEE and RaFD, which when trained and tested independently yielded test accuracies of 74.79% and 95.71%, respectively. Generalization of results was evident by training on one dataset and testing on the other. Further, the image product of the cropped faces and their visual saliency maps were computed using Deep Multi-Layer Network for saliency prediction and were fed to the facial expression recognition CNN. In the most generalized experiment, we observed the top-1 accuracy in the test set to be 65.39%. General confusion trends between different facial expressions as exhibited by humans were also observed.

为了识别人的面部表情，我们开发了卷积神经网络。我们已经将在ILSVRC2012中使用的视觉识别数据集上训练的现有卷积神经网络模型微调到两个广泛使用的面部表情数据集CFEE和RaFD，当分别训练和测试时，分别得到74.79％和95.71％的测试精度。通过对一个数据集进行训练并对另一个数据集进行测试，结果的泛化是明显的。进一步，使用深度多层网络为显着性预测计算裁剪后的人脸图像产品及其视觉显着图，并将其馈送到面部表情识别CNN。在最广泛的实验中，我们观察到测试集中的前1个精度为65.39％。还观察到人类表现出的不同面部表情之间普遍的混淆趋势。
