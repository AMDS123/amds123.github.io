##### Abstract
Automatic short answer grading (ASAG) techniques are designed to automatically assess short answers to questions in natural language, having a length of a few words to a few sentences. Supervised ASAG techniques have been demonstrated to be effective but suffer from a couple of key practical limitations. They are greatly reliant on instructor provided model answers and need labeled training data in the form of graded student answers for every assessment task. To overcome these, in this paper, we introduce an ASAG technique with two novel features. We propose an iterative technique on an ensemble of (a) a text classifier of student answers and (b) a classifier using numeric features derived from various similarity measures with respect to model answers. Second, we employ canonical correlation analysis based transfer learning on a common feature representation to build the classifier ensemble for questions having no labelled data. The proposed technique handsomely beats all winning supervised entries on the SCIENTSBANK dataset from the Student Response Analysis task of SemEval 2013. Additionally, we demonstrate generalizability and benefits of the proposed technique through evaluation on multiple ASAG datasets from different subject topics and standards.

自动短回答分级（ASAG）技术被设计为自动评估对自然语言问题的短回答，具有几个字到几个句子的长度。监督ASAG技术已被证明是有效的，但受到一些关键的实际限制。他们很大程度上依赖于教师提供的模型答案，并且需要以评分学生答案的形式为每个评估任务标记培训数据。为了克服这些，本文介绍了一种具有两个新特征的ASAG技术。 （a）学生答案的文本分类器和（b）使用从模型答案的各种相似度量度导出的数字特征的分类器，我们提出了一种迭代技术。其次，我们采用基于典型相关分析的转移学习方法，在共同的特征表示上为没有标注数据的问题建立分类器集合。所提出的技术从SemEval 2013的学生反应分析任务中胜过所有获奖监督条目。另外，我们通过评估来自不同主题和标准的多个ASAG数据集来证明所提议的技术的普遍性和益处。
