##### Abstract
Despite the impressive success of quantum structures to model long-standing human judgement and decision puzzles, the {\it quantum cognition research programme} still faces challenges about its explanatory power. Indeed, quantum models introduce new parameters, which may fit empirical data without necessarily explaining them. Also, one wonders whether more general non-classical structures are better equipped to model cognitive phenomena. In this paper, we provide a {\it realistic-operational foundation of decision processes} using a known decision-making puzzle, the {\it Ellsberg paradox}, as a case study. Then, we elaborate a novel representation of the Ellsberg decision situation applying standard quantum correspondence rules which map realistic-operational entities into quantum mathematical terms. This result opens the way towards an independent, foundational rather than phenomenological, motivation for a general use of quantum Hilbert space structures in human cognition.
