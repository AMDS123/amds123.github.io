##### Abstract
Reasoning systems with too simple a model of the world and human intent are unable to consider potential negative side effects of their actions and modify their plans to avoid them (e.g., avoiding potential errors). However, hand-encoding the enormous and subtle body of facts that constitutes common sense into a knowledge base has proved too difficult despite decades of work. Distributed semantic vector spaces learned from large text corpora, on the other hand, can learn representations that capture shades of meaning of common-sense concepts and perform analogical and associational reasoning in ways that knowledge bases are too rigid to perform, by encoding concepts and the relations between them as geometric structures. These have, however, the disadvantage of being unreliable, poorly understood, and biased in their view of the world by the source material. This chapter will discuss how these approaches may be combined in a way that combines the best properties of each for understanding the world and human intentions in a richer way.

##### Abstract (translated by Google)
具有过于简单的世界和人类意图模型的推理系统无法考虑其行为的潜在负面影响，并修改其避免它们的计划（例如，避免潜在的错误）。然而，将构成常识的大量细微的事实手工编码到知识库中，尽管经过数十年的努力，仍然证明了这一点。另一方面，从大型文本语料库中学习的分布式语义向量空间可以学习捕捉常识概念含义阴影的表示，并通过对概念进行编码，以知识库过于严格而无法执行的方式进行类比和联想推理它们之间的关系是几何结构。然而，这些方面的缺点是不可靠，知之甚少，并且偏见于来源材料对世界的看法。本章将讨论如何将这些方法结合起来，以便以更丰富的方式结合每种方法的最佳特性来理解世界和人的意图。
