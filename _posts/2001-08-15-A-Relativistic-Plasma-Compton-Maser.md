##### Abstract
A relativistic pair-plasma which contains a high excitation of electrostatic turbulence could produce intense radiation at brightness temperature in excess of 10^22 K by stimulated scattering. Important relativistic effects would include the broadband frequency response of the plasma and Compton-boosting of the scattered radiation. In radio-frequency relativistic plasma, the optical depth can be as small as hundreds of meters. When the plasma wave excitation and particle distributions are one-dimensional, the frequency-dependent angular distribution of the emission exhibits characteristics of pulsar emission.
