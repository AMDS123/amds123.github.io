##### Abstract
Synthesizing and converting environmental sounds have the potential for many applications such as supporting movie and game production, data augmentation for sound event detection and scene classification. Conventional works on synthesizing and converting environmental sounds are based on a physical modeling or concatenative approach. However, there are a limited number of works that have addressed environmental sound synthesis and conversion with statistical generative models; thus, this research area is not yet well organized. In this paper, we review problem definitions, applications, and evaluation methods of environmental sound synthesis and conversion. We then report on environmental sound synthesis using sound event labels, in which we focus on the current performance of statistical environmental sound synthesis and investigate how we should conduct subjective experiments on environmental sound synthesis.
