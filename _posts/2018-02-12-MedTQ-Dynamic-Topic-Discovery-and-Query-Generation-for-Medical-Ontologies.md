##### Abstract
Biomedical ontology refers to a shared conceptualization for a biomedical domain of interest that has vastly improved data management and data sharing through the open data movement. The rapid growth and availability of biomedical data make it impractical and computationally expensive to perform manual analysis and query processing with the large scale ontologies. The lack of ability in analyzing ontologies from such a variety of sources, and supporting knowledge discovery for clinical practice and biomedical research should be overcome with new technologies. In this study, we developed a Medical Topic discovery and Query generation framework (MedTQ), which was composed by a series of approaches and algorithms. A predicate neighborhood pattern-based approach introduced has the ability to compute the similarity of predicates (relations) in ontologies. Given a predicate similarity metric, machine learning algorithms have been developed for automatic topic discovery and query generation. The topic discovery algorithm, called the hierarchical K-Means algorithm was designed by extending an existing supervised algorithm (K-means clustering) for the construction of a topic hierarchy. In the hierarchical K-Means algorithm, a level-by-level optimization strategy was selected for consistent with the strongly association between elements within a topic. Automatic query generation was facilitated for discovered topic that could be guided users for interactive query design and processing. Evaluation was conducted to generate topic hierarchy for DrugBank ontology as a case study. Results demonstrated that the MedTQ framework can enhance knowledge discovery by capturing underlying structures from domain specific data and ontologies.

生物医学本体论是指对感兴趣的生物医学领域的共享概念化，通过开放数据移动极大地改进了数据管理和数据共享。生物医学数据的快速增长和可用性使得用大规模本体进行手动分析和查询处理是不切实际且计算昂贵的。应用新技术克服缺乏从各种来源分析本体的能力，并支持临床实践和生物医学研究的知识发现。在这项研究中，我们开发了一个医疗主题发现和查询生成框架（MedTQ），它由一系列方法和算法组成。引入的基于谓词邻域模式的方法有能力计算本体中谓词（关系）的相似性。给定谓词相似性度量，机器学习算法已经被开发用于自动主题发现和查询生成。通过扩展现有的监督算法（K均值聚类）来构建主题层次结构，设计了称为分层K均值算法的主题发现算法。在分层K-Means算法中，选择逐级优化策略以与主题内的元素之间的强烈关联一致。为发现的主题提供了自动查询生成功能，可以引导用户进行交互式查询设计和处理。作为案例研究进行评估以生成DrugBank本体的主题层次结构。结果表明，MedTQ框架可以通过从领域特定数据和本体中捕获底层结构来加强知识发现。
