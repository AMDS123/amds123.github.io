##### Abstract
We propose two spectral algorithms for partitioning nodes in directed graphs respectively with a cyclic and an acyclic pattern of connection between groups of nodes. Our methods are based on the computation of extremal eigenvalues of the transition matrix associated to the directed graph. The two algorithms outperform state-of-the art methods for directed graph clustering on synthetic datasets, including methods based on blockmodels, bibliometric symmetrization and random walks. Our algorithms have the same space complexity as classical spectral clustering algorithms for undirected graphs and their time complexity is also linear in the number of edges in the graph. One of our methods is applied to a trophic network based on predator-prey relationships. It successfully extracts common categories of preys and predators encountered in food chains. The same method is also applied to highlight the hierarchical structure of a worldwide network of Autonomous Systems depicting business agreements between Internet Service Providers.

我们提出了两种频谱算法用于分别在有向图中分割节点组之间的循环和非循环连接模式。我们的方法基于与有向图相关的转移矩阵的极值特征值的计算。这两种算法比合成数据集上的有向图聚类的现有技术方法优越，包括基于块模型，文献计量对称和随机游走的方法。我们的算法与无向图的经典谱聚类算法具有相同的空间复杂度，并且它们的时间复杂度在图的边数也是线性的。我们的一种方法被应用于基于捕食者 - 猎物关系的营养网络。它成功地提取了食物链中常见的猎物和捕食者类别。同样的方法也被用来强调描述互联网服务提供商之间业务协议的自治系统的全球网络的层次结构。
