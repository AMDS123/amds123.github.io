##### Abstract
Despite the promise of recent deep neural networks in the iris recognition setting, there are vital properties of the classic IrisCode which are almost unable to be achieved with current deep iris networks: the compactness of model and the small number of computing operations (FLOPs). This paper re-models the iris network design process as a constrained optimization problem which takes model size and computation into account as learning criteria. On one hand, this allows us to fully automate the network design process to search for the best iris network confined to the computation and model compactness constraints. On the other hand, it allows us to investigate the optimality of the classic IrisCode and recent iris networks. It also allows us to learn an optimal iris network and demonstrate state-of-the-art performance with less computation and memory requirements.
