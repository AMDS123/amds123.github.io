##### Abstract
Question answering over knowledge base (KB-QA) has recently become a popular research topic in NLP. One popular way to solve the KB-QA problem is to make use of a pipeline of several NLP modules, including entity discovery and linking (EDL) and relation detection. Recent success on KB-QA task usually involves complex network structures with sophisticated heuristics. Inspired by a previous work that builds a strong KB-QA baseline, we propose a simple but general neural model composed of fixed-size ordinally forgetting encoding (FOFE) and deep neural networks, called FOFE-net to solve KB-QA problem at different stages. For evaluation, we use two popular KB-QA datasets, SimpleQuestions and WebQSP, and a newly created dataset, FreebaseQA. The experimental results show that FOFE-net performs well on KB-QA subtasks, entity discovery and linking (EDL) and relation detection, and in turn pushing overall KB-QA system to achieve strong results on all datasets.
