##### Abstract
We present a detailed description and reference implementation of preprocessing steps necessary to prepare the public Retrospective Image Registration Evaluation (RIRE) dataset for the task of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to X-ray computed tomography (CT) translation. Furthermore we describe and implement three state of the art convolutional neural network (CNN) and generative adversarial network (GAN) models where we report statistics and visual results of two of them.
