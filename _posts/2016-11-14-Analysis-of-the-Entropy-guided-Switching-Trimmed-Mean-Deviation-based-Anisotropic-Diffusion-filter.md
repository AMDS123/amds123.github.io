##### Abstract
This report describes the experimental analysis of a proposed switching filter-anisotropic diffusion hybrid for the filtering of the fixed value (salt and pepper) impulse noise (FVIN). The filter works well at both low and high noise densities though it was specifically designed for high noise density levels. The filter combines the switching mechanism of decision-based filters and the partial differential equation-based formulation to yield a powerful system capable of recovering the image signals at very high noise levels. Experimental results indicate that the filter surpasses other filters, especially at very high noise levels. Additionally, its adaptive nature ensures that the performance is guided by the metrics obtained from the noisy input image. The filter algorithm is of both global and local nature, where the former is chosen to reduce computation time and complexity, while the latter is used for best results.

本报告描述了对于固定值（盐和胡椒）脉冲噪声（FVIN）滤波的所提出的切换滤波器 - 各向异性扩散混合的实验分析。该滤波器在低噪声和高噪声密度下工作良好，虽然它专为高噪声密度设计。该滤波器结合了基于决策的滤波器的切换机制和基于偏微分方程的公式，以产生一个强大的系统，能够以非常高的噪声水平恢复图像信号。实验结果表明，该滤波器超过了其他滤波器，特别是在非常高的噪声水平下。此外，其自适应特性确保了性能由从噪声输入图像获得的度量指导。过滤算法既具有全局性又具有局部性，前者被选择用来减少计算时间和复杂性，而后者被用来获得最佳结果。
