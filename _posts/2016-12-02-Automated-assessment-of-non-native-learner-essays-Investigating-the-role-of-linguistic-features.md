##### Abstract
Automatic essay scoring (AES) refers to the process of scoring free text responses to given prompts, considering human grader scores as the gold standard. Writing such essays is an essential component of many language and aptitude exams. Hence, AES became an active and established area of research, and there are many proprietary systems used in real life applications today. However, not much is known about which specific linguistic features are useful for prediction and how much of this is consistent across datasets. This article addresses that by exploring the role of various linguistic features in automatic essay scoring using two publicly available datasets of non-native English essays written in test taking scenarios. The linguistic properties are modeled by encoding lexical, syntactic, discourse and error types of learner language in the feature set. Predictive models are then developed using these features on both datasets and the most predictive features are compared. While the results show that the feature set used results in good predictive models with both datasets, the question "what are the most predictive features?" has a different answer for each dataset.

##### Abstract (translated by Google)
自动评分（AES）是指将评分者的自由文本回答按照给定的提示进行评分的过程。写这样的文章是许多语言和能力考试的重要组成部分。因此，AES成为了一个活跃而且已经确立的研究领域，现在有许多专有系统被用于现实生活中。然而，关于哪些特定的语言特征对于预测是有用的，以及在数据集中有多少是一致的，我们所知甚少。本文通过探索各种语言特征在自动作文评分中的作用，使用测试情景中编写的两个公开可用的非母语英语散文数据集。语言特性是通过对特征集中的学习者语言的词汇，句法，语篇和错误类型进行编码来建模的。然后在这两个数据集上使用这些特征开发预测模型，并比较最具预测性的特征。虽然结果显示所使用的特征集与两个数据集都产生了良好的预测模型，但是“最有预测性的特征是什么？对每个数据集有不同的答案。
