##### Abstract
Adsorption of ammonia at NH3/NH2/H covered GaN(0001) surface was analyzed using results of ab initio calculations. The whole configuration space of partially NH3/NH2/H covered GaN(0001) surface was divided into zones differently pinned Fermi level: at Ga broken bond state for dominantly bare surface (region I), at VBM for NH2 and H covered (region II), and at CBM for NH3 covered surface (region III). The extensive ab intio calculations show validity of electron counting rule (ECR) for all mixed coverage, for bordering these three regions. The adsorption was analyzed using newly identified dependence of the adsorption energy on the charge transfer at the surface. For region I and II ammonia adsorb dissociatively, disintegrating into H adatom and HN2 radical for large fraction of vacant sites while for high coverage the ammonia adsorption is molecular. The dissociative adsorption energy strongly depends on the Fermi level at the surface (pinned) and in the bulk (unpinned) while the molecular adsorption energy is determined by bonding to surface only, in accordance to the recently published theory. The molecular adsorption is determined by the energy of covalent bonding to the surface. Ammonia adsorption in region III (Fermi level pinned at CBM) leads to unstable configuration both molecular and dissociative which is explained by the fact that Ga-broken bond sites are doubly occupied by electrons. The adsorbing ammonia brings 8 electrons to the surface, necessitating transfer of the electrons from Ga-broken bond state to Fermi level, energetically costly process. Adsorption of ammonia at H-covered site leads to creation of NH2 radical at the surface and escape of H2 molecule. The process energy is close to 0.12 eV, thus not large, but the inverse process is not possible due to escape of the hydrogen molecule.

NH 3 / NH 2 / H覆盖的GaN（0001）表面上的氨的吸附使用从头计算的结果进行分析。将部分NH3 / NH2 / H覆盖的GaN（0001）表面的整个结构空间划分为不同的固定费米能级区域：在Ga断裂键态为主要裸露表面（区域I），VBM为NH2和H覆盖（区域II ），煤层气为NH3覆盖的表面（区域III）。广泛的计算表明，电子计数规则（ECR）在所有混合覆盖范围内都符合这三个区域的有效性。使用新近确定的吸附能量对表面电荷转移的依赖性来分析吸附。对于区域I和区域II，氨分子吸附分解为H原子和HN2自由基，大部分为空位，而对于高覆盖度，氨吸附为分子。根据最近发表的理论，解离吸附能强烈地依赖于表面（钉扎）和体（无钉扎）的费米能级，而分子吸附能仅通过键合到表面来确定。分子吸附是由与表面共价结合的能量决定的。在区域III中的氨吸附（在煤层气中固定的费米能级）导致不稳定的分子和解离配置，这是由Ga-断键位被电子双重占据的事实解释的。吸附氨将8个电子带到表面，需要将电子从Ga-断键态转移到费米能级，这是一个耗费大量成本的过程。在H覆盖的位置上吸附氨导致在表面产生NH 2自由基并逸出H 2分子。过程能量接近0.12eV，因此不是很大，但是由于氢分子的逸出，反过程是不可能的。
