##### Abstract
The character vocabulary can be very large in non-alphabetic languages such as Chinese and Japanese, which makes neural network models huge to process such languages. We explored a model for sentiment classification that takes the embeddings of the radicals of the Chinese characters, i.e, hanzi of Chinese and kanji of Japanese. Our model is composed of a CNN word feature encoder and a bi-directional RNN document feature encoder. The results achieved are on par with the character embedding-based models, and close to the state-of-the-art word embedding-based models, with 90% smaller vocabulary, and at least 13% and 80% fewer parameters than the character embedding-based models and word embedding-based models respectively. The results suggest that the radical embedding-based approach is cost-effective for machine learning on Chinese and Japanese.

中文和日文这样的非字母语言的字符词汇可能非常大，这使得神经网络模型处理这种语言的能力巨大。我们探索了一个汉字自由基嵌入的情感分类模型，即汉语汉字和日本汉字。我们的模型由一个CNN字特征编码器和一个双向RNN文件特征编码器组成。所获得的结果与基于字符嵌入的模型相当，并且接近基于最先进的基于字嵌入的模型，词汇量减少90％，参数比字符少至少13％和80％基于嵌入的模型和基于词嵌入的模型。结果表明，基于基于嵌入的方法对于中文和日文的机器学习是成本有效的。
