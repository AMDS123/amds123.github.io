##### Abstract
Estimating the intensity of emotion has gained significance as modern textual inputs in potential applications like social media, e-retail markets, psychology, advertisements etc., carry a lot of emotions, feelings, expressions along with its meaning. However, the approaches of traditional sentiment analysis primarily focuses on classifying the sentiment in general (positive or negative) or at an aspect level(very positive, low negative, etc.) and cannot exploit the intensity information. Moreover, automatically identifying emotions like anger, fear, joy, sadness, disgust etc., from text introduces challenging scenarios where single tweet may contain multiple emotions with different intensities and some emotions may even co-occur in some of the tweets. In this paper, we propose an architecture, Experts Model, inspired from the standard Mixture of Experts (MoE) model. The key idea here is each expert learns different sets of features from the feature vector which helps in better emotion detection from the tweet. We compared the results of our Experts Model with both baseline results and top five performers of SemEval-2018 Task-1, Affect in Tweets (AIT). The experimental results show that our proposed approach deals with the emotion detection problem and stands at top-5 results.
