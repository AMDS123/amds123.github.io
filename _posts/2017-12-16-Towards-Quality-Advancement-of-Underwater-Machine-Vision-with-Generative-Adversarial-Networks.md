##### Abstract
Underwater machine vision attracts more attention, but the terrible quality prohibits it from a wide range of applications. There exist many algorithms to solve this problem, but the real-time and adaptive method is frequently deficient. In this paper, based on filtering and Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), two approaches are proposed for the aforementioned issue, i.e., a filtering-based restoration scheme (FRS) and a GAN-based restoration scheme (GAN-RS). Distinct from the previous methods, FRS restores underwater image in the frequency domain, which is composed of parameter search, filtering, and enhancement. Aiming to further improve the image quality, the GAN-RS is able to adaptively restore underwater machine vision in real time without any pretreatment. In particular, the information in Lab color space and the dark channel is developed as the loss function, namely underwater index loss and dark channel prior loss. More specifically, learning from the underwater index, the discriminator is equipped with a carefully crafted underwater branch to predict the underwater probability of an image. Multi-stage loss strategy, then, is developed to guarantee the effective training of GANs. Through extensive comparisons on image quality and applications, the superiority of the proposed approaches is confirmed. As a result, the GAN-RS is much faster and achieves the state-of-the-art performance on color correction, contrast stretch, dehazing, and feature restoration of various underwater scenes. Note that the source code will be made available.

水下机器视觉吸引了更多的关注，但可怕的质量禁止它从广泛的应用。解决这个问题的算法有很多，但是实时性和自适应性的方法往往是不足的。在本文中，基于滤波和生成对抗网络（GAN），针对上述问题提出了两种方法，即基于滤波的恢复方案（FRS）和基于GAN的恢复方案（GAN-RS）。与以往的方法不同，FRS在频域恢复水下图像，由参数搜索，滤波和增强组成。为了进一步提高图像质量，GAN-RS能够实时自适应地恢复水下机器视觉，无需任何预处理。特别是Lab色彩空间和暗通道中的信息是作为损失函数发展的，即水下指标损失和暗通道先前损失。更具体地说，从水下索引中学习，鉴别器配备精心制作的水下分支来预测图像的水下可能性。为了保证GAN的有效培训，开发了多阶段损失策略。通过对图像质量和应用的广泛比较，证实了所提出的方法的优越性。因此，GAN-RS速度更快，在各种水下场景的色彩校正，对比度拉伸，除雾和特征恢复方面达到了最先进的性能。请注意，源代码将可用。
