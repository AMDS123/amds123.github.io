##### Abstract
In this paper, we investigate the integration of sentence position and semantic role of words in a PageRank system to build a key phrase ranking method. We present the evaluation results of our approach on three scientific articles. We show that semantic role information, when integrated with a PageRank system, can become a new lexical feature. Our approach had an overall improvement on all the data sets over the state-of-art baseline approaches.
