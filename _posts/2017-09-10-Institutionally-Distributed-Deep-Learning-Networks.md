##### Abstract
Deep learning has become a promising approach for automated medical diagnoses. When medical data samples are limited, collaboration among multiple institutions is necessary to achieve high algorithm performance. However, sharing patient data often has limitations due to technical, legal, or ethical concerns. In such cases, sharing a deep learning model is a more attractive alternative. The best method of performing such a task is unclear, however. In this study, we simulate the dissemination of learning deep learning network models across four institutions using various heuristics and compare the results with a deep learning model trained on centrally hosted patient data. The heuristics investigated include ensembling single institution models, single weight transfer, and cyclical weight transfer. We evaluated these approaches for image classification in three independent image collections (retinal fundus photos, mammography, and ImageNet). We find that cyclical weight transfer resulted in a performance (testing accuracy = 77.3%) that was closest to that of centrally hosted patient data (testing accuracy = 78.7%). We also found that there is an improvement in the performance of cyclical weight transfer heuristic with high frequency of weight transfer.

深度学习已成为自动医疗诊断的一种有前途的方法。当医疗数据样本有限时，多个机构之间的协作对于实现高算法性能是必要的。但是，由于技术，法律或道德方面的考虑，共享患者数据往往具有局限性。在这种情况下，分享深度学习模式是更有吸引力的选择。然而，执行这样的任务的最佳方法还不清楚。在这项研究中，我们使用各种启发式模拟四个机构学习深度学习网络模型的传播，并将结果与​​在中央托管的患者数据上训练的深度学习模型进行比较。调查的启发式方法包括集合单一机构模型，单一权重转移和周期性权重转移。我们评估了这些方法在三个独立的图像集合（视网膜眼底照片，乳房X线照相和ImageNet）的图像分类。我们发现周期性的体重转移导致了最接近于集中托管的患者数据（测试准确度= 78.7％）的表现（测试准确度= 77.3％）。我们还发现，重量转移频率高的循环权重转移启发式的性能有所提高。
