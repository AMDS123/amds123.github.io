##### Abstract
Scene understanding is a popular and challenging topic in both computer vision and photogrammetry. Scene graph provides rich information for such scene understanding. This paper presents a novel approach to infer such relations and then to construct the scene graph. Support relations are estimated by considering important, previously ignored information: the physical stability and the prior support knowledge between object classes. In contrast to previous methods for extracting support relations, the proposed approach generates more accurate results, and does not require a pixel-wise semantic labeling of the scene. The semantic scene graph which describes all the contextual relations within the scene is constructed using this information. To evaluate the accuracy of these graphs, multiple different measures are formulated. The proposed algorithms are evaluated using the NYUv2 database. The results demonstrate that the inferred support relations are more precise than state-of-the-art. The scene graphs are compared against ground truth graphs.

场景理解是计算机视觉和摄影测量中的一个流行和具有挑战性的话题。场景图形为这种场景理解提供了丰富的信息。本文提出了一种新的方法来推断这种关系，然后构造场景图。通过考虑以前忽略的重要信息来估计支持关系：对象类之间的物理稳定性和先验支持知识。与先前的提取支持关系的方法相比，所提出的方法产生更准确的结果，并且不需要场景的像素方式语义标记。描述场景内所有上下文关系的语义场景图是使用这个信息构建的。为了评估这些图表的准确性，制定了多种不同的措施。所提出的算法使用NYUv2数据库进行评估。结果表明推断的支持关系比现有技术更精确。场景图与地面实况图进行比较。
