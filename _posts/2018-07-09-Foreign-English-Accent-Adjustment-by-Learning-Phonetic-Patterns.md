##### Abstract
State-of-the-art automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems struggle with the lack of data for rare accents. For sufficiently large datasets, neural engines tend to outshine statistical models in most natural language processing problems. However, a speech accent remains a challenge for both approaches. Phonologists manually create general rules describing a speaker's accent, but their results remain underutilized. In this paper, we propose a model that automatically retrieves phonological generalizations from a small dataset. This method leverages the difference in pronunciation between a particular dialect and General American English (GAE) and creates new accented samples of words. The proposed model is able to learn all generalizations that previously were manually obtained by phonologists. We use this statistical method to generate a million phonological variations of words from the CMU Pronouncing Dictionary and train a sequence-to-sequence RNN to recognize accented words with 59% accuracy.

##### Abstract (translated by Google)
最先进的自动语音识别（ASR）系统很难用于稀有口音的数据缺乏。对于足够大的数据集，神经引擎倾向于在大多数自然语言处理问题中超过统计模型。然而，言语口音仍然是两种方法的挑战。语音学家手动创建描述说话者口音的一般规则，但他们的结果仍未得到充分利用。在本文中，我们提出了一个模型，可以从一个小数据集中自动检索语音概括。该方法利用特定方言与通用美国英语（GAE）之间的发音差异，并创建新的重音单词样本。所提出的模型能够学习以前由语音学家手动获得的所有概括。我们使用这种统计方法从CMU Pronouncing Dictionary中生成一百万个单词的语音变体，并训练一个序列到序列的RNN，以59％的准确度识别重音单词。
