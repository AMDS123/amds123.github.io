##### Abstract
Dempster-Shafer evidence theory has been widely used in various fields of applications, because of the flexibility and effectiveness in modeling uncertainties without prior information. Besides, it has been proven that the quantum theory has powerful capabilities of solving the decision making problems, especially for modelling human decision and cognition. However, due to the inconsistency of the expression, the classical Dempster-Shafer evidence theory modelled by real numbers can not be integrated directly with the quantum theory modelled by complex numbers. So, how can we establish a bridge of communications between the classical Dempster-Shafer evidence theory and the quantum theory? To answer this question, a generalized Dempster-Shafer evidence theory is proposed in this paper. The main contribution in this study is that, unlike the existing evidence theory, a mass function in the generalized Dempster-Shafer evidence theory is modelled by a complex number, called as a complex mass function. In addition, compared with the classical Dempster's combination rule, the condition in terms of the conflict coefficient between two evidences (K &lt; 1) is released in the generalized Dempster's combination rule so that it is more general and applicable than the classical Dempster's combination rule. When the complex mass function is degenerated from complex numbers to real numbers, the generalized Dempster's combination rule degenerates to the classical evidence theory under the condition that the conflict coefficient between two evidences K is less than 1. This generalized Dempster-Shafer evidence theory provides a promising way to model and handle more uncertain information. Numerical examples are illustrated to show the efficiency of the generalized Dempster-Shafer evidence theory.

由于在没有先验信息的情况下模拟不确定性的灵活性和有效性，证据理论在各个领域得到了广泛的应用。此外，量子理论具有较强的解决决策问题的能力，特别是对于人的决策和认知建模。然而，由于表达的不一致性，用实数建模的经典证据证据理论不能直接与复数模拟的量子理论相结合。那么，我们如何才能建立经典证据证据理论和量子理论之间的沟通桥梁呢？为了回答这个问题，本文提出了一个广义的证据 - 证据理论。本研究的主要贡献在于，与现有的证据理论不同，广义Dempster-Shafer证据理论中的质量函数是用一个复数来模拟的，称为复数质量函数。另外，与经典的Dempster组合规则相比，根据两个证据之间的冲突系数（K＆lt; 1）的条件在广义Dempster组合规则中被释放，使得它比传统的Dempster组合规则更一般和可应用。当复数质量函数从复数退化为实数时，在两个证据K之间的冲突系数小于1的条件下，广义证明者的组合规则退化为经典证据理论。这种广义的证据证据理论提供了建模和处理更多不确定信息的有前途的方法。数值例子说明了广义DS证据理论的有效性。
