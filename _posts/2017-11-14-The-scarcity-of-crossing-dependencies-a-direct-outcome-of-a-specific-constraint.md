##### Abstract
The structure of a sentence can be represented as a network where vertices are words and edges indicate syntactic dependencies. Interestingly, crossing syntactic dependencies have been observed to be infrequent in human languages. This leads to the question of whether the scarcity of crossings in languages arises from an independent and specific constraint on crossings. We provide statistical evidence suggesting that this is not the case, as the proportion of dependency crossings of sentences from a wide range of languages can be accurately estimated by a simple predictor based on a null hypothesis on the local probability that two dependencies cross given their lengths. The relative error of this predictor never exceeds 5% on average, whereas the error of a baseline predictor assuming a random ordering of the words of a sentence is at least 6 times greater. Our results suggest that the low frequency of crossings in natural languages is neither originated by hidden knowledge of language nor by the undesirability of crossings per se, but as a mere side effect of the principle of dependency length minimization.

##### Abstract (translated by Google)
一个句子的结构可以表示为一个网络，其中顶点是单词，边表示语法上的依赖关系。有趣的是，跨语法依赖在人类语言中很少见。这就产生了一个问题：语言交叉的缺乏是否是由于对交叉的独立和特定的约束而产生的。我们提供的统计证据表明情况并非如此，因为来自各种语言的句子的依赖关系交叉比例可以通过基于零假设的简单预测因子准确地估计， 。这个预测因子的相对误差平均不会超过5％，而基线预测因子假设一个句子的单词随机排序的误差至少要大6倍。我们的研究结果表明，自然语言中交叉的低频既不是源于语言的隐藏知识，也不是源于交叉本身的不可取之处，而仅仅是依赖长度最小化原则的副作用。
