##### Abstract
Thanks to its high refractive index contrast, band gap and polarization mismatch compared to GaN, In0.17Al0.83N layers lattice-matched to GaN are an attractive solution for applications such as distributed Bragg reflectors, ultraviolet light-emitting diodes, or high electron mobility transistors. In order to study the structural degradation mechanism of InAlN layers with increasing thickness, we performed metalorganic vapor phase epitaxy of InAlN layers of thicknesses ranging from 2 to 500 nm, on free-standing (0001) GaN substrates with a low density of threading dislocations, for In compositions of 13.5% (layers under tensile strain), and 19.7% (layers under compressive strain). In both cases, a surface morphology with hillocks is initially observed, followed by the appearance of V-defects. We propose that those hillocks arise due to kinetic roughening, and that V-defects subsequently appear beyond a critical hillock size. It is seen that the critical thickness for the appearance of V-defects increases together with the surface diffusion length either by increasing the temperature or the In flux because of a surfactant effect. In thick InAlN layers, a better (worse) In incorporation occurring on the concave (convex) shape surfaces of the V-defects is observed leading to a top phase-separated InAlN layer lying on the initial homogeneous InAlN layer after V-defects coalescence. It is suggested that similar mechanisms could be responsible for the degradation of thick InGaN layers.

由于与GaN相比具有高折射率对比度，带隙和偏振失配，与GaN晶格匹配的In0.17Al0.83N层对于诸如分布式布拉格反射器，紫外发光二极管或高电子迁移率晶体管。为了研究随着厚度增​​加InAlN层的结构退化机制，我们在低密度的穿透位错的自支撑（0001）GaN衬底上进行厚度为2至500nm的InAlN层的有机金属气相外延，对于13.5％（在拉伸应变下的层）和19.7％（在压缩应变下的层）的组成中。在这两种情况下，首先观察到具有小丘的表面形态，随后出现V-缺陷。我们建议这些小丘由于动力学粗糙化而出现，并且V-缺陷随后出现在关键的小丘尺寸之外。可以看出，由于表面活性剂效应，通过提高温度或In流量，V缺陷外观的临界厚度与表面扩散长度一起增加。在厚InAlN层中，观察到在V缺陷的凹（凸）形表面上发生的更好（更差）In掺入，导致在V缺陷聚结之后，位于初始均匀InAlN层上的顶部相分离InAlN层。有人建议类似的机制可能是造成厚InGaN层退化的原因。
