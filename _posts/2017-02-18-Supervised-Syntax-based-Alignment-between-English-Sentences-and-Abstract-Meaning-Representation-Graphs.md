##### Abstract
As alignment links are not given between English sentences and Abstract Meaning Representation (AMR) graphs in the AMR annotation, automatic alignment becomes indispensable for training an AMR parser. Previous studies formalize it as a string-to-string problem and solve it in an unsupervised way, which suffers from data sparseness due to the small size of training data for English-AMR alignment. In this paper, we formalize it as a syntax-based alignment problem and solve it in a supervised manner based on syntax trees, which can address the data sparseness problem by generalizing English-AMR tokens to syntax tags. Experiments verify the effectiveness of the proposed method not only for English-AMR alignment, but also for AMR parsing.

##### Abstract (translated by Google)
由于AMR注释中的英语句子和抽象含义表示（AMR）图之间没有对齐链接，自动对齐对于训练AMR解析器来说是不可或缺的。以往的研究将其形式化为字符串到字符串的问题，并以无监督的方式进行求解，由于英文AMR对齐的训练数据量小，数据稀疏。在本文中，我们将其形式化为基于语法的对齐问题，并以基于语法树的监督方式进行解决，通过将英语-AMR标记推广到语法标记来解决数据稀疏性问题。实验验证了所提方法的有效性，不仅对于英文AMR对齐，而且对AMR解析也有效。
