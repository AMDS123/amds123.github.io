##### Abstract
Robotic systems are increasingly used in rehabilitation to provide high intensity training for patients with motor impairment. The results of controlled trials involving human subjects confirm the effectiveness of robot-enhanced methods and prove them to be marginally superior over standard manual therapy in some cases. Although very promising, this line of research is still in its infancy and further studies are required to fully understand the potential benefits of using robotic devices such as exoskeletons. Exoskeletons have been widely studied due to their capability in providing more control over paretic limb as well as the complexities involved in their design and control. This paper briefly discusses the main challenges in development of rehabilitation exoskeletons and elaborates more on how some of these issues are addressed in the design of CLEVERarm, a recently developed upper limb rehabilitation exoskeleton. The paper is concluded with several remarks on the current challenges in wide-spread use of exoskeletons in medical facilities, and a vision for the future of these technologies in rehabilitation medicine.

##### Abstract (translated by Google)
机器人系统越来越多地用于康复，为运动障碍患者提供高强度训练。涉及人类受试者的对照试验的结果证实了机器人增强方法的有效性，并证明它们在某些情况下比标准手动疗法略微优越。虽然这个研究方向非常有希望，但仍处于起步阶段，需要进一步的研究来充分理解使用机器人设备如外骨骼的潜在好处。外骨骼由于能够更好地控制隐瞒肢体以及设计和控制的复杂性而被广泛研究。本文简要讨论了康复外骨骼发展中的主要挑战，并详细阐述了在最近开发的上肢康复外骨骼CLEVERarm的设计中如何解决这些问题。文章最后对当前医疗设备中广泛使用外骨骼的挑战，以及康复医学这些技术的未来展望进行了几点评述。
