##### Abstract
Structure from motion is an import theme in computer vision. Although great progress has been made both in theory and applications, most of the algorithms only work for static scenes and rigid objects. In recent years, structure and motion recovery of non-rigid objects and dynamic scenes have received a lot of attention. In this paper, the state-of-the-art techniques for structure and motion factorization of non-rigid objects are reviewed and discussed. First, an introduction of the structure from motion problem is presented, followed by a general formulation of non-rigid structure from motion. Second, an augmented affined factorization framework, by using homogeneous representation, is presented to solve the registration issue in the presence of outlying and missing data. Third, based on the observation that the reprojection residuals of outliers are significantly larger than those of inliers, a robust factorization strategy with outlier rejection is proposed by means of the reprojection residuals, followed by some comparative experimental evaluations. Finally, some future research topics in non-rigid structure from motion are discussed.

##### Abstract (translated by Google)
运动结构是计算机视觉中的一个重要主题。虽然在理论和应用上都取得了很大的进步，但是大多数算法只适用于静态场景和刚体。近年来，非刚性物体的结构和运动恢复以及动态场景受到了很多关注。在本文中，审查和讨论了非刚性物体的结构和运动分解的最新技术。首先介绍运动问题的结构，然后从运动的角度对非刚性结构进行一般的表述。其次，通过使用同质表示，提出了一个扩展的加性因子分解框架，以解决存在边界和缺失数据时的注册问题。再次，基于异常值投影残差显着大于非投影值的观察结果，通过投影残差的方法提出了具有异常值拒绝的鲁棒分解策略，并进行了比较实验评估。最后讨论了运动中非刚性结构的未来研究课题。
