##### Abstract
In this paper, we introduce attribute-aware fashion-editing, a novel task, to the fashion domain. We re-define the overall objectives in AttGAN and propose the Fashion-AttGAN model for this new task. A dataset is constructed for this task with 14,221 and 22 attributes, which has been made publically available. Experimental results show the effectiveness of our Fashion-AttGAN on fashion editing over the original AttGAN.
