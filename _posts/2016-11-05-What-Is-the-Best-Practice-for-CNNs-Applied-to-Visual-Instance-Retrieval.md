##### Abstract
Previous work has shown that feature maps of deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) can be interpreted as feature representation of a particular image region. Features aggregated from these feature maps have been exploited for image retrieval tasks and achieved state-of-the-art performances in recent years. The key to the success of such methods is the feature representation. However, the different factors that impact the effectiveness of features are still not explored thoroughly. There are much less discussion about the best combination of them. The main contribution of our paper is the thorough evaluations of the various factors that affect the discriminative ability of the features extracted from CNNs. Based on the evaluation results, we also identify the best choices for different factors and propose a new multi-scale image feature representation method to encode the image effectively. Finally, we show that the proposed method generalises well and outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on four typical datasets used for visual instance retrieval.

以前的研究表明，深度卷积神经网络（CNN）的特征映射可以解释为特定图像区域的特征表示。从这些特征图汇总的特征已经被用于图像检索任务，并且近年来实现了最新的性能表现。这种方法成功的关键是特征表示。但是，影响特征有效性的各种因素仍然没有得到彻底的探索。关于他们的最佳组合的讨论少得多。本文的主要贡献是对影响CNN特征判别能力的各种因素的全面评估。基于评估结果，我们也确定了不同因素的最佳选择，并提出了一种新的多尺度图像特征表示方法来有效地对图像进行编码。最后，我们证明了所提出的方法在用于视觉实例检索的四个典型数据集上一般化并优于最先进的方法。
