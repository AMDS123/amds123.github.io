##### Abstract
The manual outlining of hepatic metastasis in (US) ultrasound acquisitions from patients suffering from pancreatic cancer is common practice. However, such pure manual measurements are often very time consuming, and the results repeatedly differ between the raters. In this contribution, we study the in-depth assessment of an interactive graph-based approach for the segmentation for pancreatic metastasis in US images of the liver with two specialists in Internal Medicine. Thereby, evaluating the approach with over one hundred different acquisitions of metastases. The two physicians or the algorithm had never assessed the acquisitions before the evaluation. In summary, the physicians first performed a pure manual outlining followed by an algorithmic segmentation over one month later. As a result, the experts satisfied in up to ninety percent of algorithmic segmentation results. Furthermore, the algorithmic segmentation was much faster than manual outlining and achieved a median Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) of over eighty percent. Ultimately, the algorithm enables a fast and accurate segmentation of liver metastasis in clinical US images, which can support the manual outlining in daily practice.

（US）超声采集手册中概述肝转移是胰腺癌患者的常用手段。但是，这种纯粹的手动测量往往非常耗时，而且评分员之间的结果反复出现差异。在这篇文章中，我们研究了一种基于交互式图形的方法在美国内科医学专家对美国肝脏图像中胰腺转移分割的深入评估。因此，用超过一百种不同的转移获得来评估方法。在评估之前，两位医师或算法从未评估过这些收购。总之，医生首先执行纯手动轮廓，然后在一个月后进行算法分割。因此，专家对算法分割结果的百分之九十满意。此外，算法分割比手动概述快得多，并且实现了超过百分之八十的中值模拟相似系数（DSC）。最终，该算法能够在临床美国图像中快速准确地分割肝转移，这可以支持日常实践中的手动概述。
