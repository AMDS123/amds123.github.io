##### Abstract
Artificial Intelligence (AI) - the phenomenon of machines being able to solve problems that require human intelligence - has in the past decade seen an enormous rise of interest due to significant advances in effectiveness and use. The health sector, one of the most important sectors for societies and economies worldwide, is particularly interesting for AI applications, given the ongoing digitalisation of all types of health information. The potential for AI assistance in the health domain is immense, because AI can support medical decision making at reduced costs, everywhere. However, due to the complexity of AI algorithms, it is difficult to distinguish good from bad AI-based solutions and to understand their strengths and weaknesses, which is crucial for clarifying responsibilities and for building trust. For this reason, the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) has established a new Focus Group on "Artificial Intelligence for Health" (FG-AI4H) in partnership with the World Health Organization (WHO). Health and care services are usually the responsibility of a government - even when provided through private insurance systems - and thus under the responsibility of WHO/ITU member states. FG-AI4H will identify opportunities for international standardization, which will foster the application of AI to health issues on a global scale. In particular, it will establish a standardized assessment framework with open benchmarks for the evaluation of AI-based methods for health, such as AI-based diagnosis, triage or treatment decisions.

人工智能（AI） - 机器能够解决需要人类智能的问题的现象 - 在过去十年中由于有效性和使用方面的显着进步而引起了巨大的兴趣。鉴于所有类型的健康信息都在不断数字化，卫生部门是全世界社会和经济最重要的部门之一，对人工智能应用尤其感兴趣。人工智能援助在卫生领域的潜力是巨大的，因为人工智能可以在任何地方以更低的成本支持医疗决策。然而，由于AI算法的复杂性，很难区分好的和基于AI的不良解决方案并理解它们的优点和缺点，这对于澄清责任和建立信任至关重要。为此，国际电信联盟（ITU）与世界卫生组织（WHO）合作，成立了一个新的“健康人工智能”焦点组（FG-AI4H）。卫生和护理服务通常是政府的责任 - 即使是通过私人保险系统提供 - 因此由世卫组织/国际电联成员国负责。 FG-AI4H将确定国际标准化的机会，这将促进人工智能在全球范围内应用于健康问题。特别是，它将建立一个标准化的评估框架，其中包含用于评估基于AI的健康方法的开放基准，例如基于AI的诊断，分类或治疗决策。
