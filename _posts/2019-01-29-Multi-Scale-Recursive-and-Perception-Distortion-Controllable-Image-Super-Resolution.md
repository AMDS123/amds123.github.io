##### Abstract
We describe our solution for the PIRM Super-Resolution Challenge 2018 where we achieved the 2nd best perceptual quality for average RMSE&lt;=16, 5th best for RMSE&lt;=12.5, and 7th best for RMSE&lt;=11.5. We modify a recently proposed Multi-Grid Back-Projection (MGBP) architecture to work as a generative system with an input parameter that can control the amount of artificial details in the output. We propose a discriminator for adversarial training with the following novel properties: it is multi-scale that resembles a progressive-GAN; it is recursive that balances the architecture of the generator; and it includes a new layer to capture significant statistics of natural images. Finally, we propose a training strategy that avoids conflicts between reconstruction and perceptual losses. Our configuration uses only 281k parameters and upscales each image of the competition in 0.2s in average.
