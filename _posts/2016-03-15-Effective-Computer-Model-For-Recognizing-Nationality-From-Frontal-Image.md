##### Abstract
We are introducing new effective computer model for extracting nationality from frontal image candidate using face part color, size and distances based on deep research. Determining face part size, color, and distances is depending on a variety of factors including image quality, lighting condition, rotation angle, occlusion and facial emotion. Therefore, first we need to detect a face on the image then convert an image into the real input. After that, we can determine image candidate gender, face shape, key points and face parts. Finally, we will return the result, based on the comparison of sizes and distances with the sample measurement table database. While we were measuring samples, there were big differences between images by their gender and face shapes. Input images must be the frontal face image that has smooth lighting and does not have any rotation angle. The model can be used in military, police, defense, healthcare, and technology sectors. Finally, Computer can distinguish nationality from the face image.

在深入研究的基础上，采用人脸部分颜色，大小和距离，引入了一种新的有效的计算机模型，确定脸部部分的大小，颜色和距离取决于各种因素，包括图像质量，照明条件，旋转角度，遮挡和面部情绪。因此，首先我们需要检测图像上的脸部，然后将图像转换为实际的输入。之后，我们可以确定图像候选人的性别，脸形，关键点和脸部分。最后，根据尺寸和距离与样本测量表数据库的比较，我们将返回结果。当我们测量样本时，图像的性别和面貌有很大的差异。输入图像必须是具有平滑照明且没有任何旋转角度的正面人脸图像。该模型可用于军事，警察，国防，医疗保健和技术领域。最后，计算机可以区分国籍和人脸图像。
