##### Abstract
Limited data and low dose constraints are common problems in a variety of tomographic reconstruction paradigms which lead to noisy and incomplete data. Over the past few years sinogram denoising has become an essential pre-processing step for low dose Computed Tomographic (CT) reconstructions. We propose a novel sinogram denoising algorithm inspired by the modern field of signal processing on graphs. Graph based methods often perform better than standard filtering operations since they can exploit the signal structure. This makes the sinogram an ideal candidate for graph based denoising since it generally has a piecewise smooth structure. We test our method with a variety of phantoms and different reconstruction methods. Our numerical study shows that the proposed algorithm improves the performance of analytical filtered back-projection (FBP) and iterative methods ART (Kaczmarz) and SIRT (Cimmino).We observed that graph denoised sinogram always minimizes the error measure and improves the accuracy of the solution as compared to regular reconstructions.

有限的数据和低剂量限制是各种层析成像重建范例中常见的问题，导致噪声和不完整的数据。在过去几年中，对于低剂量计算机断层摄影（CT）重建来说，弦图去噪已经成为重要的预处理步骤。我们提出了一个新颖的图形去噪算法，受现代信号处理领域的启发。基于图的方法通常比标准的过滤操作性能更好，因为它们可以利用信号结构。这使得正弦图成为基于图的去噪的理想候选，因为它通常具有分段平滑的结构。我们用各种幻影和不同的重建方法来测试我们的方法。我们的数值研究表明，该算法改善了解析滤波反投影（FBP）和迭代方法ART（Kaczmarz）和SIRT（Cimmino）的性能。我们观察到图形去噪正弦图总是最小化误差测量并提高解决方案相比，定期重建。
