##### Abstract
In this paper, we propose an effective feature extraction algorithm, called Multi-Subregion based Correlation Filter Bank (MS-CFB), for robust face recognition. MS-CFB combines the benefits of global-based and local-based feature extraction algorithms, where multiple correlation filters correspond- ing to different face subregions are jointly designed to optimize the overall correlation outputs. Furthermore, we reduce the computational complexi- ty of MS-CFB by designing the correlation filter bank in the spatial domain and improve its generalization capability by capitalizing on the unconstrained form during the filter bank design process. MS-CFB not only takes the d- ifferences among face subregions into account, but also effectively exploits the discriminative information in face subregions. Experimental results on various public face databases demonstrate that the proposed algorithm pro- vides a better feature representation for classification and achieves higher recognition rates compared with several state-of-the-art algorithms.

在本文中，我们提出了一种有效的特征提取算法，称为基于多分区的相关滤波器组（MS-CFB），用于鲁棒人脸识别。 MS-CFB结合了基于全局和基于局部的特征提取算法的优点，其中多个相关滤波器对应于不同的脸部子区域，共同设计以优化整体相关输出。此外，通过在空域中设计相关滤波器组来降低MS-CFB的计算复杂度，并在滤波器组设计过程中利用无约束形式来提高其泛化能力。 MS-CFB不仅考虑了人脸区域间的差异性，还有效利用了人脸区域的判别信息。在不同的公开人脸数据库上的实验结果表明，与一些最先进的算法相比，该算法提供了更好的分类特征表示，并且实现了更高的识别率。
