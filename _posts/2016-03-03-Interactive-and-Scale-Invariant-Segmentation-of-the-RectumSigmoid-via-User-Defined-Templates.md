##### Abstract
Among all types of cancer, gynecological malignancies belong to the 4th most frequent type of cancer among women. Besides chemotherapy and external beam radiation, brachytherapy is the standard procedure for the treatment of these malignancies. In the progress of treatment planning, localization of the tumor as the target volume and adjacent organs of risks by segmentation is crucial to accomplish an optimal radiation distribution to the tumor while simultaneously preserving healthy tissue. Segmentation is performed manually and represents a time-consuming task in clinical daily routine. This study focuses on the segmentation of the rectum/sigmoid colon as an Organ-At-Risk in gynecological brachytherapy. The proposed segmentation method uses an interactive, graph-based segmentation scheme with a user-defined template. The scheme creates a directed two dimensional graph, followed by the minimal cost closed set computation on the graph, resulting in an outlining of the rectum. The graphs outline is dynamically adapted to the last calculated cut. Evaluation was performed by comparing manual segmentations of the rectum/sigmoid colon to results achieved with the proposed method. The comparison of the algorithmic to manual results yielded to a Dice Similarity Coefficient value of 83.85+/-4.08%, in comparison to 83.97+/-8.08% for the comparison of two manual segmentations of the same physician. Utilizing the proposed methodology resulted in a median time of 128 seconds per dataset, compared to 300 seconds needed for pure manual segmentation.

在所有类型的癌症中，妇女恶性肿瘤属于女性中第四最常见类型的癌症。近距离放疗除了化疗和外照射外，也是治疗这些恶性肿瘤的标准程序。在治疗计划的进展中，通过分割将肿瘤定位为靶体积和邻近的风险器官对于实现肿瘤的最佳辐射分布同时保持健康的组织是至关重要的。分割手动完成，代表临床日常工作中耗时的工作。这项研究的重点是在妇科近距离放疗中将直肠/乙状结肠分割为器官风险。所提出的分割方法使用具有用户定义的模板的交互式的，基于图的分割方案。该方案创建一个有向二维图，然后在图上进行最小成本闭集计算，从而产生一个直肠的轮廓。图形轮廓动态适应上次计算的切割。通过比较手术分割的直肠/乙状结肠与所提出的方法获得的结果进行评估。算法与手动结果的比较产生了83.85 +/- 4.08％的骰子相似系数值，而对于同一医师的两个手动分割的比较，则为83.97 +/- 8.08％。利用所提出的方法导致每个数据集的中值时间为128秒，而纯手动分割需要300秒。
