##### Abstract
Collective rhythmic dynamics from neurons is vital for cognitive functions such as memory formation but how neurons self-organize to produce such activity is not well understood. Attractor-based models have been successfully implemented as a theoretical framework for memory storage in networks of neurons. Activity-dependent modification of synaptic transmission is thought to be the physiological basis of learning and memory. The goal of this study is to demonstrate that using a pharmacological perturbation on in vitro networks of hippocampal neurons that has been shown to increase synaptic strength follows the dynamical postulates theorized by attractor models. We use a grid of extracellular electrodes to study changes in network activity after this perturbation and show that there is a persistent increase in overall spiking and bursting activity after treatment. This increase in activity appears to recruit more "errant" spikes into bursts. Lastly, phase plots indicate a conserved activity pattern suggesting that the network is operating in a stable dynamical state.

来自神经元的集体节奏动力对于记忆形成等认知功能是至关重要的，但神经元如何自我组织来产生这样的活动还不是很清楚。基于吸引子的模型已经被成功地实现为神经元网络中的记忆存储的理论框架。突触传递的依赖活动的修饰被认为是学习和记忆的生理基础。这项研究的目的是证明使用海马神经元的体外网络的药理学扰动已被证明增加突触强度遵循动力学假设吸引子模型理论。我们使用细胞外电极网格来研究这种扰动之后的网络活动的变化，并且显示在治疗之后总体加标和爆裂活性持续增加。这种活动的增加似乎会招致更多“错误的”尖峰爆发。最后，相图显示一个保守的活动模式，表明网络运行在一个稳定的动态状态。
