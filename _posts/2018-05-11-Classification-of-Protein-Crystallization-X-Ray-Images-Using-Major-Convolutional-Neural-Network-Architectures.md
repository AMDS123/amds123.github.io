##### Abstract
The generation of protein crystals is necessary for the study of protein molecular function and structure. This is done empirically by processing large numbers of crystallization trials and inspecting them regularly in search of those with forming crystals. To avoid missing the hard-gained crystals, this visual inspection of the trial X-ray images is done manually as opposed to the existing less accurate machine learning methods. To achieve higher accuracy for automation, we applied some of the most successful convolutional neural networks (ResNet, Inception, VGG, and AlexNet) for 10-way classification of the X-ray images. We showed that substantial classification accuracy is gained by using such networks compared to two simpler ones previously proposed for this purpose. The best accuracy was obtained from ResNet (81.43%), which corresponds to a missed crystal rate of 5.9%. This rate could be lowered to less than 0.1% by using a top-3 classification strategy. Our dataset consisted of 486,000 internally annotated images, which was augmented to more than a million to address class imbalance. We also provide a label-wise analysis of the results, identifying the main sources of error and inaccuracy.

蛋白质晶体的生成对于蛋白质分子功能和结构的研究是必需的。这是通过处理大量的结晶试验并经常检查它们以寻找具有结晶的晶体来经验性地完成的。为了避免遗漏晶体，人工完成了试验X射线图像的视觉检查，而不是现有的不太精确的机器学习方法。为了实现更高的自动化精度，我们应用了一些最成功的卷积神经网络（ResNet，Inception，VGG和AlexNet）来对X射线图像进行10路分类。我们表明，与以前为此目的提出的两个较简单的网络相比，使用这种网络获得了实质性的分类准确性。 ResNet获得最高的准确度（81.43％），这相当于5.9％的漏检率。通过使用排名前3的分类策略，这个比率可以降低到0.1％以下。我们的数据集由486,000个内部注释图像组成，为了解决阶级失衡问题，这个数据量增加到100多万。我们还对结果进行标签分析，找出错误和不准确的主要来源。
