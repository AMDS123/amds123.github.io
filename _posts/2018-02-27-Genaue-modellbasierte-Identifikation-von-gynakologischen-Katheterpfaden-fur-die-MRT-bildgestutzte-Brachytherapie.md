##### Abstract
Mortality in gynecologic cancers, including cervical, ovarian, vaginal and vulvar cancers, is more than 6% internationally [1]. In many countries external radiotherapy is supplemented by brachytherapy with high locally administered doses as standard. The superior ability of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to differentiate soft tissue has led to an increasing use of this imaging technique in the intraoperative planning and implementation of brachytherapy. A technical challenge associated with the use of MRI imaging for brachytherapy - in contrast to computed tomography (CT) imaging - is the dark-diffuse appearance and thus difficult identification of the catheter paths in the resulting images. This problem is addressed by the precise method described herein of tracing the catheters from the catheter tip. The average identification time for a single catheter path was three seconds on a standard PC. Segmentation time, accuracy and precision are promising indicators of the value of this method for the clinical application of image-guided gynecological brachytherapy. After surgery (OP), the healthy surrounding tissue of the tumor is usually irradiated. This reduces the risk of leaving behind residual cells that would likely cause a recurrence of the cancer or the formation of metastases - secondary tumors elsewhere in the body. In the case of a tumor on the cervix or prostate, the operation is minimally invasive, ie. the removal of the cancer and the irradiation are performed cost-effectively and risk-avoiding by keyhole surgery instead of open surgery.

妇科癌症包括宫颈癌，卵巢癌，阴道癌和外阴癌在内的死亡率在国际上超过6％[1]。在许多国家，外部放疗通过近距离放疗和局部施用高剂量作为标准来补充。磁共振成像（MRI）在区分软组织方面的卓越能力使得这种成像技术在近距离放射治疗的术中规划和实施中的应用日益增加。与计算机断层扫描（CT）成像相比，与使用MRI成像进行近距离放射治疗相关的技术挑战是黑暗扩散的外观，因此难以在所得图像中识别导管路径。该问题通过在此描述的从导管尖端追踪导管的精确方法来解决。标准PC上单导管路径的平均识别时间为3秒。分割时间，准确性和精确度是该方法在影像引导妇科近距离治疗临床应用价值的有希望的指标。手术后（OP），通常照射肿瘤的健康周围组织。这降低了留下可能导致癌症复发或转移形成的残余细胞的风险 - 身体其他地方的继发性肿瘤。对于宫颈或前列腺上的肿瘤，手术是微创的，即。通过锁孔手术代替开放式手术，可以经济有效地避免癌症和辐射，避免风险。
