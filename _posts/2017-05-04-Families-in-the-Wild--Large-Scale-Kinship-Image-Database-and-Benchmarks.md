##### Abstract
We present the largest kinship recognition dataset to date, Families in the Wild (FIW). Motivated by the lack of a single, unified dataset for kinship recognition, we aim to provide a dataset that captivates the interest of the research community. With only a small team, we were able to collect, organize, and label over 10,000 family photos of 1,000 families with our annotation tool designed to mark complex hierarchical relationships and local label information in a quick and efficient manner. We include several benchmarks for two image-based tasks, kinship verification and family recognition. For this, we incorporate several visual features and metric learning methods as baselines. Also, we demonstrate that a pre-trained Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) as an off-the-shelf feature extractor outperforms the other feature types. Then, results were further boosted by fine-tuning two deep CNNs on FIW data: (1) for kinship verification, a triplet loss function was learned on top of the network of pre-trained weights; (2) for family recognition, a family-specific softmax classifier was added to the network.

我们介绍迄今为止最大的亲缘关系识别数据集，野外家庭（FIW）。由于缺乏用于亲属认同的单一统一数据集，我们的目标是提供一个吸引研究界兴趣的数据集。只需一个小团队，我们就能够通过我们的注释工具来收集，整理和标记超过10,000个家庭的10,000张家庭照片，该工具旨在快速高效地标记复杂的层次关系和本地标签信息。我们包含了两个基于图像的任务的基准，亲属验证和家庭认可。为此，我们将几个视觉特征和度量学习方法作为基线。此外，我们证明，预先训练的卷积神经网络（CNN）作为现成的特征提取器优于其他特征类型。然后，通过对FIW数据上的两个深度CNN进行微调来进一步提高结果：（1）对于亲属验证，在预先训练的权重网络之上学习三重损失函数; （2）家庭认可，家庭特定softmax分类器被添加到网络。
