##### Abstract
Dual-fisheye lens cameras have been increasingly used for 360-degree immersive imaging. However, the limited overlapping field of views and misalignment between the two lenses give rise to visible discontinuities in the stitching boundaries. This paper introduces a novel method for dual-fisheye camera stitching that adaptively minimizes the discontinuities in the overlapping regions to generate full spherical 360-degree images. Results show that this approach can produce good quality stitched images for Samsung Gear 360 -- a dual-fisheye camera, even with hard-to-stitch objects in the stitching borders.

双鱼眼镜头相机越来越多地用于360度沉浸式成像。然而，两个透镜之间有限的重叠视场和错位导致了拼接边界中的可见不连续性。本文介绍了一种双鱼眼相机拼接的新方法，自适应地最小化重叠区域的不连续性，以生成全球360度的图像。结果表明，这种方法可以为三星Gear 360产生高质量的拼接图像，即使在拼接边界中难以缝合的物体也是双鱼眼相机。
