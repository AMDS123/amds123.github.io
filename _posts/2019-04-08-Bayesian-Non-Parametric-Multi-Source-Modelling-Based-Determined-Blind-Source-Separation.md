##### Abstract
This paper proposes a determined blind source separation method using Bayesian non-parametric modelling of sources. Conventionally source signals are separated from a given set of mixture signals by modelling them using non-negative matrix factorization (NMF). However in NMF, a latent variable signifying model complexity must be appropriately specified to avoid over-fitting or under-fitting. As real-world sources can be of varying and unknown complexities, we propose a Bayesian non-parametric framework which is invariant to such latent variables. We show that our proposed method adapts to different source complexities, while conventional methods require parameter tuning for optimal separation.
