##### Abstract
Humanoid robots have apparently similar body structure like human beings. Due to their technical design, they are sharing the same workspace with humans. They are placed to clean things, to assist old age people, to entertain us and most importantly to serve us. To be acceptable in the household, they must have higher level of intelligence than industrial robots and they must be social and capable of interacting people around it, who are not supposed to be robot specialist. All these come under the field of human robot interaction (HRI). There are various modes like speech, gesture, behavior etc. through which human can interact with robots. To solve all these challenges, a multimodel technique has been introduced where gesture as well as speech is used as a mode of interaction.
