##### Abstract
This paper proposes a causal inference relation and causal programming as general frameworks for causal inference with structural causal models. A tuple, $\langle M, I, Q, F \rangle$, is an instance of the relation if a formula, $F$, computes a causal query, $Q$, as a function of known population probabilities, $I$, in every model entailed by a set of model assumptions, $M$. Many problems in causal inference can be viewed as the problem of enumerating instances of the relation that satisfy given criteria. This unifies a number of previously studied problems, including causal effect identification, causal discovery and recovery from selection bias. In addition, the relation supports formalizing new problems in causal inference with structural causal models, such as the problem of research design. Causal programming is proposed as a further generalization of causal inference as the problem of finding optimal instances of the relation, with respect to a cost function.

##### Abstract (translated by Google)
本文提出了因果推理关系和因果规划作为结构因果模型的因果推理的一般框架。如果公式$ F $计算作为已知总体概率函数的因果查询，$ Q $，则$元组$ $ langle $，I，Q，F \ rangle $是一个关系的实例，$ I $，在每个模型中由一组模型假设所需的$ M $。因果推论中的许多问题可以被看作是列举符合给定标准的关系实例的问题。这将以前研究过的许多问题统一起来，包括因果效应识别，因果发现和从选择偏倚中恢复。此外，这种关系还支持将因果推理中的新问题与结构因果模型相结合，比如研究设计问题。因果编程被推荐为因果推论的进一步推广，因为它是关于成本函数寻找关系的最佳实例的问题。
