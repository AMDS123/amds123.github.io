##### Abstract
Research suggests that a Motorcycle Autonomous Emergency Braking system (MAEB) could influence 25% of the crashes involving powered two wheelers (PTWs). By automatically slowing down a host PTW of up to 10 km/h in inevitable collision scenarios, MAEB could potentially mitigate the crash severity for the riders. The feasibility of automatic decelerations of motorcycles was shown via field trials in controlled environment. However, the feasibility of correct MAEB triggering in the real traffic context is still unclear. In particular, MAEB requires an accurate obstacle detection, the feasibility of which from a single track vehicle has not been confirmed yet. To address this issue, our study presents obstacle detection tests in a real-world MAEB-sensitive crash scenario.

研究表明，摩托车自主紧急制动系统（MAEB）可能影响25％的涉及动力两轮车（PTW）的碰撞。通过在不可避免的碰撞情况下自动减慢高达10km / h的主PTW，MAEB可能潜在地减轻车手的碰撞严重性。通过在受控环境下的现场试验显示了摩托车自动减速的可行性。然而，在真实的交通环境中正确的MAEB触发的可行性仍然不清楚。特别是，MAEB需要准确的障碍物检测，单轨车辆的可行性尚未得到证实。为了解决这个问题，我们的研究在现实世界MAEB敏感的碰撞情景中提出了障碍物检测测试。
