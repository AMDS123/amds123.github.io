##### Abstract
Neural networks are proven to be remarkably successful for classification and diagnosis in medical applications. However, the ambiguity in the decision-making process and the interpretability of the learned features is a matter of concern. In this work, we propose a method for improving the feature interpretability of neural network classifiers. Initially, we propose a baseline convolutional neural network with state of the art performance in terms of accuracy and weakly supervised localization. Subsequently, the loss is modified to integrate robustness to adversarial examples into the training process. In this work, feature interpretability is quantified via evaluating the weakly supervised localization using the ground truth bounding boxes. Interpretability is also visually assessed using class activation maps and saliency maps. The method is applied to NIH ChestX-ray14, the largest publicly available chest x-rays dataset. We demonstrate that the adversarially robust optimization paradigm improves feature interpretability both quantitatively and visually.
