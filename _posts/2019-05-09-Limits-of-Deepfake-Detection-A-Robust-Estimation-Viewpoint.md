##### Abstract
Deepfake detection is formulated as a hypothesis testing problem to classify an image as genuine or GAN-generated. A robust statistics view of GANs is considered to bound the error probability for various GAN implementations in terms of their performance. The bounds are further simplified using a Euclidean approximation for the low error regime. Lastly, relationships between error probability and epidemic thresholds for spreading processes in networks are established.
