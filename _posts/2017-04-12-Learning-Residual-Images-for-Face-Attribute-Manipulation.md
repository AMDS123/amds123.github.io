##### Abstract
Face attributes are interesting due to their detailed description of human faces. Unlike prior researches working on attribute prediction, we address an inverse and more challenging problem called face attribute manipulation which aims at modifying a face image according to a given attribute value. Instead of manipulating the whole image, we propose to learn the corresponding residual image defined as the difference between images before and after the manipulation. In this way, the manipulation can be operated efficiently with modest pixel modification. The framework of our approach is based on the Generative Adversarial Network. It consists of two image transformation networks and a discriminative network. The transformation networks are responsible for the attribute manipulation and its dual operation and the discriminative network is used to distinguish the generated images from real images. We also apply dual learning to allow transformation networks to learn from each other. Experiments show that residual images can be effectively learned and used for attribute manipulations. The generated images remain most of the details in attribute-irrelevant areas.

由于人脸的详细描述，人脸属性很有趣。与以前的属性预测研究不同，我们解决了一个反向的，更具挑战性的问题，称为面部属性操作，其目的是根据给定的属性值修改面部图像。我们建议学习相应的残差图像，而不是操纵整个图像，而是定义为操纵前后图像之间的差异。以这种方式，操作可以在适度的像素修改下有效地操作。我们的方法框架是基于生成敌对网络。它由两个图像转换网络和一个判别网络组成。转换网络负责属性操作及其双重操作，利用判别网络将生成的图像与真实图像进行区分。我们也应用双重学习，使转化网络相互学习。实验表明，残差图像可以有效地学习和用于属性操作。生成的图像保留了属性无关区域中的大部分细节。
