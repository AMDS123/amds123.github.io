##### Abstract
Successful completion of reasoning task requires the agent to have relevant prior knowledge or some given context of the world dynamics. Usually, the information provided to the system for a reasoning task is just the query or some supporting story, which is often not enough for common reasoning tasks. The goal here is that, if the information provided along the question is not sufficient to correctly answer the question, the model should choose k most relevant documents that can aid its inference process. In this work, the model dynamically selects top k most relevant memory candidates that can be used to successfully solve reasoning tasks. Experiments were conducted on a subset of Winograd Schema Challenge (WSC) problems to show that the proposed model has the potential for commonsense reasoning. The WSC is a test of machine intelligence, designed to be an improvement on the Turing test.

推理任务的成功完成需要代理人具有相关的先验知识或某些给定的世界动态背景。通常，向系统提供推理任务的信息只是查询或一些支持性的故事，这对于常见的推理任务来说通常是不够的。这里的目标是，如果问题提供的信息不足以正确回答问题，那么模型应该选择k个最相关的文档，以帮助其推理过程。在这项工作中，模型动态地选择可用于成功解决推理任务的前k个最相关的存储器候选。对Winograd模式挑战（WSC）问题的一个子集进行了实验，以表明所提出的模型具有常识推理的潜力。 WSC是对机器智能的测试，旨在改进图灵测试。
