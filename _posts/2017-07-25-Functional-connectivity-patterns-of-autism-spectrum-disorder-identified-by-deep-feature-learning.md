##### Abstract
Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is regarded as a brain disease with globally disrupted neuronal networks. Even though fMRI studies have revealed abnormal functional connectivity in ASD, they have not reached a consensus of the disrupted patterns. Here, a deep learning-based feature extraction method identifies multivariate and nonlinear functional connectivity patterns of ASD. Resting-state fMRI data of 972 subjects (465 ASD 507 normal controls) acquired from the Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange were used. A functional connectivity matrix of each subject was generated using 90 predefined brain regions. As a data-driven feature extraction method without prior knowledge such as subjects diagnosis, variational autoencoder (VAE) summarized the functional connectivity matrix into 2 features. Those feature values of ASD patients were statistically compared with those of controls. A feature was significantly different between ASD and normal controls. The extracted features were visualized by VAE-based generator which can produce virtual functional connectivity matrices. The ASD-related feature was associated with frontoparietal connections, interconnections of the dorsal medial frontal cortex and corticostriatal connections. It also showed a trend of negative correlation with full-scale IQ. A data-driven feature extraction based on deep learning could identify complex patterns of functional connectivity of ASD. This approach will help discover complex patterns of abnormalities in brain connectivity in various brain disorders.

孤独症谱系障碍（ASD）被认为是具有全球性破坏的神经元网络的脑部疾病。尽管功能磁共振成像研究揭示了ASD功能连接异常，但他们还没有达成共识。在这里，深度的基于学习的特征提取方法识别ASD的多变量和非线性函数连通性模式。使用从自闭症脑成像数据交换获得的972个受试者（465个ASD 507正常对照）的静止状态fMRI数据。使用90个预定义的脑区域产生每个受试者的功能连接矩阵。变分自动编码器（VAE）作为一种数据驱动的特征提取方法，无需预先知识，如主题诊断，将功能连通性矩阵归纳为2个特征。 ASD患者的特征值与对照组进行统计学比较。 ASD和正常对照之间的特征显着不同。提取的特征通过基于VAE的生成器可视化，该生成器可以产生虚拟功能连接矩阵。与ASD相关的特征与前额叶连接，背侧内侧额叶皮层和皮质纹状连接的相互关联。它也呈现与全面智商负相关的趋势。基于深度学习的数据驱动特征提取可以识别ASD的功能连通性的复杂模式。这种方法将有助于发现各种脑部疾病中脑连接异常的复杂模式。
