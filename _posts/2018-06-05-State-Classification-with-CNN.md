##### Abstract
There is a plenty of research going on in field of object recognition, but object state recognition has not been addressed as much. There are many important applications which can utilize object state recognition, such as, in robotics, to decide for how to grab an object. A convolution neural network was designed to classify an image to one of its states. The approach used for training is transfer learning with Inception v3 module of GoogLeNet used as the pre-trained model. The model was trained on images of 18 cooking objects and tested on another set of cooking objects. The model was able to classify those images with 76% accuracy.

目标识别领域有很多研究正在进行，但目标状态识别还没有得到很好的解决。有许多重要的应用程序可以利用对象状态识别，例如在机器人技术中决定如何抓取对象。卷积神经网络被设计为将图像分类为其状态之一。用于训练的方法是将GoogLeNet的Inception v3模块用作预训练模型的转移学习。该模型接受18个烹饪对象的图像训练，并在另一组烹饪对象上进行测试。该模型能够以76％的准确度对这些图像进行分类。
