##### Abstract
We report the results of sub-parsec scale submillimeter observations towards an embedded high-mass young stellar object in the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC) with ALMA. Complementary infrared data obtained with the AKARI satellite and the Gemini-South telescope are also presented. The target infrared point source is spatially resolved into two dense molecular cloud cores; one is associated with a high-mass young stellar object (YSO core), while another is not associated with an infrared source (East core). The two cores are dynamically associated but show different chemical characteristics. Emission lines of CS, C33S, H2CS, SO, SO2, CH3OH, H13CO+, H13CN, SiO, and dust continuum are detected from the observed region. Tentative detection of HDS is also reported. The first detection of CH3OH in the SMC has a strong impact on our understanding of the formation of complex organic molecules in metal-poor environments. The gas temperature is estimated to be ~10 K based on the rotation analysis of CH3OH lines. The fractional abundance of CH3OH gas in the East core is estimated to be (0.5-1.5) x 10^(-8), which is comparable with or marginally higher than those of similar cold sources in our Galaxy despite a factor of five lower metallicity in the SMC. This work provides observational evidence that an organic molecule like CH3OH, which are largely formed on grain surfaces, can be produced even in a significantly lower metallicity environment compared to the solar neighborhood. A possible origin of cold CH3OH gas in the observed dense core is discussed.

我们报告了在亚马逊小麦哲伦星云（SMC）中嵌入的大质量年轻恒星物体的sub-parsec尺度亚毫米波观测结果。还介绍了使用AKARI卫星和双子座南望远镜获得的互补红外数据。目标红外点源在空间上分解成两个密集的分子云核心;一个与大质量年轻恒星物体（YSO核心）有关，而另一个与红外源（东核）不相关。两个核心是动态关联的，但显示出不同的化学特征。从观测区域检测CS，C33S，H2CS，SO，SO2，CH3OH，H13CO +，H13CN，SiO和灰尘连续体的发射线。还报告了HDS的初步检测。在SMC中首次检测到CH3OH对我们对在贫金属环境中形成复杂有机分子的理解有着强烈的影响。根据CH3OH管线的旋转分析，气体温度估计为〜10 K.东核中CH 3 OH气体的分数丰度估计为（0.5-1.5）×10 ^（-8），与我们的银河系中相似的冷源相比或略高，尽管金属性低5倍在SMC中。这项工作提供了观测证据表明，与太阳能邻域相比，即使在明显较低的金属性环境下，也可以生成大量形成在颗粒表面上的有机分子，如CH3OH。讨论了观察到的致密核心中冷CH 3 OH气体的可能来源。
