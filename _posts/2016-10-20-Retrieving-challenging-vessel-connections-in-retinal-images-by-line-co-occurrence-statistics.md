##### Abstract
Natural images contain often curvilinear structures, which might be disconnected, or partly occluded. Recovering the missing connection of disconnected structures is an open issue and needs appropriate geometric reasoning. We propose to find line co-occurrence statistics from the centerlines of blood vessels in retinal images and show its remarkable similarity to a well-known probabilistic model for the connectivity pattern in the primary visual cortex. Furthermore, the probabilistic model is trained from the data via statistics and used for automated grouping of interrupted vessels in a spectral clustering based approach. Several challenging image patches are investigated around junction points, where successful results indicate the perfect match of the trained model to the profiles of blood vessels in retinal images. Also, comparisons among several statistical models obtained from different datasets reveals their high similarity i.e., they are independent of the dataset. On top of that, the best approximation of the statistical model with the symmetrized extension of the probabilistic model on the projective line bundle is found with a least square error smaller than 2%. Apparently, the direction process on the projective line bundle is a good continuation model for vessels in retinal images.

自然图像通常包含曲线结构，可能会断开或部分遮挡。恢复断开结构的缺失连接是一个公开的问题，需要适当的几何推理。我们建议从视网膜图像中的血管中心线寻找线共现统计，并显示其与主视觉皮层中的连通模式的众所周知的概率模型的显着相似性。此外，概率模型通过统计数据训练，并用于基于谱聚类的方法中断血管的自动分组。围绕交界点研究了几个具有挑战性的图像斑块，其中成功的结果表明训练的模型与视网膜图像中血管轮廓的完美匹配。而且，从不同数据集获得的几个统计模型之间的比较显示出它们的高度相似性，即它们独立于数据集。最后，以投影线束上的概率模型对称扩展的统计模型的最佳逼近为最小二乘误差小于2％。显然，射线束上的方向过程是视网膜血管的良好延续模型。
