##### Abstract
Detection and learning based appearance feature play the central role in data association based multiple object tracking (MOT), but most recent MOT works usually ignore them and only focus on the hand-crafted feature and association algorithms. In this paper, we explore the high-performance detection and deep learning based appearance feature, and show that they lead to significantly better MOT results in both online and offline setting. We make our detection and appearance feature publicly available. In the following part, we first summarize the detection and appearance feature, and then introduce our tracker named Person of Interest (POI), which has both online and offline version.
