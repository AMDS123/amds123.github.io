##### Abstract
Detection and learning based appearance feature play the central role in data association based multiple object tracking (MOT), but most recent MOT works usually ignore them and only focus on the hand-crafted feature and association algorithms. In this paper, we explore the high-performance detection and deep learning based appearance feature, and show that they lead to significantly better MOT results in both online and offline setting. We make our detection and appearance feature publicly available. In the following part, we first summarize the detection and appearance feature, and then introduce our tracker named Person of Interest (POI), which has both online and offline version.

基于检测和学习的外观特征在基于数据关联的多目标跟踪（MOT）中起到核心作用，但是最近的MOT作品通常忽略它们，只关注手工特征和关联算法。在本文中，我们探索了高性能检测和基于深度学习的外观特征，并且显示出在线和离线设置下都能显着改善MOT的结果。我们使我们的检测和外观功能公开。在下文中，我们首先总结检测和外观特征，然后介绍我们的名为兴趣点（POI）的跟踪器，它既有在线版本，也有离线版本。
