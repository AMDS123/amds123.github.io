##### Abstract
Predicting the outcomes of integrating Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS) into the National Airspace System (NAS) is a complex problem which is required to be addressed by simulation studies before allowing the routine access of UAS into the NAS. This paper focuses on providing a 3-dimensional (3D) simulation framework using a game theoretical methodology to evaluate integration concepts using scenarios where manned and unmanned air vehicles co-exist. In the proposed method, human pilot interactive decision making process is incorporated into airspace models which can fill the gap in the literature where the pilot behavior is generally assumed to be known a priori. The proposed human pilot behavior is modeled using dynamic level-k reasoning concept and approximate reinforcement learning. The level-k reasoning concept is a notion in game theory and is based on the assumption that humans have various levels of decision making. In the conventional "static" approach, each agent makes assumptions about his or her opponents and chooses his or her actions accordingly. On the other hand, in the dynamic level-k reasoning, agents can update their beliefs about their opponents and revise their level-k rule. In this study, Neural Fitted Q Iteration, which is an approximate reinforcement learning method, is used to model time-extended decisions of pilots with 3D maneuvers. An analysis of UAS integration is conducted using an example 3D scenario in the presence of manned aircraft and fully autonomous UAS equipped with sense and avoid algorithms.

预测将无人机系统（UAS）纳入国家空域系统（NAS）的结果是一个复杂的问题，需要在允许UAS进入NAS的日常访问之前通过模拟研究加以解决。本文着重于提供一个使用游戏理论方法学的三维（3D）仿真框架，以使用有人驾驶和无人驾驶飞行器共存的情景来评估整合概念。在所提出的方法中，人类飞行员互动决策过程被纳入空域模型中，其可填补文献中飞行员行为通常被认为是先验已知的空白。所提出的人类飞行员行为使用动态水平k推理概念和近似强化学习进行建模。 k级推理概念是博弈论中的一个概念，它基于假设人类具有不同层次的决策。在传统的“静态”方法中，每个代理人对他或她的对手做出假设并相应地选择他或她的行为。另一方面，在动态k级推理中，代理人可以更新他们对对手的信念并修改他们的k级规则。在这项研究中，神经拟合Q迭代是一种近似强化学习方法，用于模拟3D机动飞行员的时间延长决策。 UAS集成的分析是通过使用有人驾驶飞机和完全自主UAS的示例3D场景进行的，该UAS配备了感应和避免算法。
