##### Abstract
This paper proposed a method for stock prediction. In terms of feature extraction, we extract the features of stock-related news besides stock prices. We first select some seed words based on experience which are the symbols of good news and bad news. Then we propose an optimization method and calculate the positive polar of all words. After that, we construct the features of news based on the positive polar of their words. In consideration of sequential stock prices and continuous news effects, we propose a recurrent neural network model to help predict stock prices. Compared to SVM classifier with price features, we find our proposed method has an over 5% improvement on stock prediction accuracy in experiments.

本文提出了一种股票预测方法。在特征提取方面，除股价外，还提取了股票相关新闻的特征。我们首先根据经验来选择一些种子词，这些都是好消息和坏消息的象征。然后，我们提出一个优化方法，并计算所有单词的正极性。之后，我们基于他们的话语的正极来构建新闻的特征。考虑到连续的股价和连续的新闻效应，我们提出了一个递归的神经网络模型来帮助预测股票价格。与具有价格特征的支持向量机分类器相比，本文提出的方法在实验中的预测精度提高了5％以上。
