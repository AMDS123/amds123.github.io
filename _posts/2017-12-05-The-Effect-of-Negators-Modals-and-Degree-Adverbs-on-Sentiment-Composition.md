##### Abstract
Negators, modals, and degree adverbs can significantly affect the sentiment of the words they modify. Often, their impact is modeled with simple heuristics; although, recent work has shown that such heuristics do not capture the true sentiment of multi-word phrases. We created a dataset of phrases that include various negators, modals, and degree adverbs, as well as their combinations. Both the phrases and their constituent content words were annotated with real-valued scores of sentiment association. Using phrasal terms in the created dataset, we analyze the impact of individual modifiers and the average effect of the groups of modifiers on overall sentiment. We find that the effect of modifiers varies substantially among the members of the same group. Furthermore, each individual modifier can affect sentiment words in different ways. Therefore, solutions based on statistical learning seem more promising than fixed hand-crafted rules on the task of automatic sentiment prediction.

否定词，情态词和程度副词可以显着影响他们所修饰单词的情感。通常，他们的影响是用简单的启发式建模的。尽管最近的研究表明，这种启发式方法并不能捕捉到多词短语的真实感受。我们创建了包含各种否定词，情态词，程度副词以及它们的组合的短语的数据集。这些短语及其组成内容词都用真实的情感关联分数来标注。在创建的数据集中使用短语术语，我们分析个别修饰语的影响以及修饰语群对整体情感的平均效果。我们发现修改者的效果在同组成员中差异很大。而且，每个单独的修饰词都可以以不同的方式影响情感词汇。因此，基于统计学习的解决方案似乎比自动情感预测任务中固定的手工规则更有前途。
