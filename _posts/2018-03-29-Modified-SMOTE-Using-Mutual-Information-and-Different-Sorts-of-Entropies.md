##### Abstract
SMOTE is one of the oversampling techniques for balancing the datasets and it is considered as a pre-processing step in learning algorithms. In this paper, four new enhanced SMOTE are proposed that include an improved version of KNN in which the attribute weights are defined by mutual information firstly and then they are replaced by maximum entropy, Renyi entropy and Tsallis entropy. These four pre-processing methods are combined with 1NN and J48 classifiers and their performance are compared with the previous methods on 11 imbalanced datasets from KEEL repository. The results show that these pre-processing methods improves the accuracy compared with the previous stablished works. In addition, as a case study, the first pre-processing method is applied on transportation data of Tehran-Bazargan Highway in Iran with IR equal to 36.

SMOTE是平衡数据集的过采样技术之一，它被认为是学习算法的预处理步骤。本文提出了四种新的增强型SMOTE，其中包括KNN的改进版本，其中属性权重首先由互信息定义，然后用最大熵，Renyi熵和Tsallis熵代替。这四种预处理方法与1NN和J48分类器相结合，并将它们的性能与先前的方法在来自KEEL存储库的11个不平衡数据集上进行比较。结果表明，这些预处理方法与以前的建立作品相比提高了准确性。此外，作为案例研究，第一种预处理方法适用于IR等于36的伊朗德黑兰巴扎干高速公路的运输数据。
