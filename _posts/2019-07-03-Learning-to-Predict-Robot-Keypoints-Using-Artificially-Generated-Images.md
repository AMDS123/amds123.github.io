##### Abstract
This work considers robot keypoint estimation on color images as a supervised machine learning task. We propose the use of probabilistically created renderings to overcome the lack of labeled real images. Rather than sampling from stationary distributions, our approach introduces a feedback mechanism that constantly adapts probability distributions according to current training progress. Initial results show, our approach achieves near-human-level accuracy on real images. Additionally, we demonstrate that feedback leads to fewer required training steps, while maintaining the same model quality on synthetic data sets.
