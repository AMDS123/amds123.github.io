##### Abstract
In this paper, we present a coupled carrier-photon model that accounts for the time-domain interactions between carrier transport and light emission in Gallium Nitride (GaN)-based LEDs that hasn't been reported so far. Carrier transport is modeled using the drift-Diffusion formulation, whereas light emission and propagation is modeled using Maxwell's equations. The drift Diffusion equation is solved self-consistently with Poisson equation. The carrier transport and photon emission are coupled by formulating an appropriate relation between radiative recombinations and dipole sources such that the strength of the dipole sources is given by the radiative recombination rates gauged to an appropriate value. This gauging factor is obtained by calibrating the External Quantum Efficiency (EQE) of homojunction GaN LED with the experimental value.
