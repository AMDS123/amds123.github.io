##### Abstract
Text detection and segmentation is an important prerequisite for many content based image analysis tasks. The paper proposes a novel text extraction and character segmentation algorithm using Maximally Stable Extremal Regions as basic letter candidates. These regions are then subjected to thresholding and thereafter various connected components are determined to identify separate characters. The algorithm is tested along a set of various JPEG, PNG and BMP images over four different character sets; English, Russian, Hindi and Urdu. The algorithm gives good results for English and Russian character set; however character segmentation in Urdu and Hindi language is not much accurate. The algorithm is simple, efficient, involves no overhead as required in training and gives good results for even low quality images. The paper also proposes various challenges in text extraction and segmentation for multilingual inputs.

文本检测和分割是许多基于内容的图像分析任务的重要先决条件。提出了一种新的基于最大稳定极值区域作为基本候选字符的文本提取和字符分割算法。然后对这些区域进行阈值处理，然后确定各种连接的组件以识别单独的字符。该算法沿着四个不同字符集上的一组各种JPEG，PNG和BMP图像进行测试;英文，俄文，印地文和乌尔都文。该算法给英文和俄文字符集提供了很好的结果;然而在乌尔都语和印地文语言中的字符分割并不准确。该算法简单，高效，不需要像训练中那样需要开销，并且即使是低质量的图像也能给出好的结果。本文还提出了多语言输入的文本提取和分割方面的各种挑战。
