##### Abstract
In an increasingly globalized world, geographic literacy is crucial. In this paper, we present a collaborative two-player game to improve people's ability to locate countries on the world map. We discuss two implementations of the game: First, we created a web-based version which can be played with the remote-controlled agent Nellie. With the knowledge we gained from a large online data collection, we re-implemented the game so it can be played face-to-face with the Furhat robot Neil. Our analysis shows that participants found the game not just engaging to play, they also believe they gained lasting knowledge about the world map.
