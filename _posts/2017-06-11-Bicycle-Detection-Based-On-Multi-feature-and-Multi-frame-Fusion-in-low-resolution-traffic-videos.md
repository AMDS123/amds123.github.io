##### Abstract
As a major type of transportation equipments, bicycles, including electrical bicycles, are distributed almost everywhere in China. The accidents caused by bicycles have become a serious threat to the public safety. So bicycle detection is one major task of traffic video surveillance systems in China. In this paper, a method based on multi-feature and multi-frame fusion is presented for bicycle detection in low-resolution traffic videos. It first extracts some geometric features of objects from each frame image, then concatenate multiple features into a feature vector and use linear support vector machine (SVM) to learn a classifier, or put these features into a cascade classifier, to yield a preliminary detection result regarding whether an object is a bicycle. It further fuses these preliminary detection results from multiple frames to provide a more reliable detection decision, together with a confidence level of that decision. Experimental results show that this method based on multi-feature and multi-frame fusion can identify bicycles with high accuracy and low computational complexity. It is, therefore, applicable for real-time traffic video surveillance systems.

作为一种主要的交通工具类型，自行车，包括电动自行车，几乎在中国各地都有销售。自行车事故已成为公共安全的严重威胁。所以自行车检测是中国交通视频监控系统的一个主要任务。本文提出了一种基于多特征多帧融合的低分辨率交通视频自行车检测方法。首先从每帧图像中提取一些物体的几何特征，然后将多个特征连接成一个特征向量，然后用线性支持向量机（SVM）学习一个分类器，或者将这些特征放入一个级联分类器中，产生一个初步的检测结果关于一个物体是否是一辆自行车。它进一步融合了来自多个帧的这些初步检测结果，以提供更可靠的检测决策以及该决定的置信水平。实验结果表明，基于多特征和多帧融合的方法能够识别自行车的精度高，计算复杂度低。因此，它适用于实时交通视频监控系统。
