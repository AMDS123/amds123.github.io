##### Abstract
In order to solve unsupervised domain adaptation problem, recent methods focus on the use of adversarial learning to learn the common representation among domains. Although many designs are proposed, they seem to ignore the negative influence of domain-specific characteristics in transferring process. Besides, they also tend to obliterate these characteristics when extracted, although they are useful for other tasks and somehow help preserve the data. Take into account these issues, in this paper, we want to design a novel domain-adaptation architecture which disentangles learned features into multiple parts to answer the questions: what features to transfer across domains and what to preserve within domains for other tasks. Towards this, besides jointly matching domain distributions in both image-level and feature-level, we offer new idea on feature exchange across domains combining with a novel feed-back loss and a semantic consistency loss to not only enhance the transfer-ability of learned common feature but also preserve data and semantic information during exchange process. By performing domain adaptation on two standard digit data sets, we show that our architecture can solve not only the full transfer problem but also partial transfer problem efficiently. The translated image results also demonstrate the potential of our architecture in image style transfer application.

为了解决无监督的领域适应问题，最近的研究方法集中于利用敌对学习来学习领域间的共同表征。尽管提出了许多设计方案，但它们似乎忽视了特定领域特征在传输过程中的负面影响。此外，他们也倾向于在提取时抹去这些特征，虽然它们对于其他任务是有用的，并以某种方式帮助保存数据。考虑到这些问题，在本文中，我们要设计一个新颖的领域适应架构，将学习到的特性分解成多个部分来回答以下问题：在域之间传递什么特性以及为了其他任务在域内保留什么。针对这一问题，除了在图像层次和特征层次上联合匹配领域分布外，还结合新颖的反馈丢失和语义一致性损失，提出了跨领域特征交换的新思路，不仅提高了学习的传递能力共同特征，而且在交换过程中保存数据和语义信息。通过对两个标准数字数据集进行域适配，我们证明了我们的体系结构不仅可以解决全传输问题，而且可以有效解决部分传输问题。翻译的图像结果也展示了我们的架构在图像风格转换应用中的潜力。
