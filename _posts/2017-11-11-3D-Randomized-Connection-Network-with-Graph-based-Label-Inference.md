##### Abstract
In this paper, a novel 3D deep learning network is proposed for brain MR image segmentation with randomized connection, which can decrease the dependency between layers and increase the network capacity. The convolutional LSTM and 3D convolution are employed as network units to capture the long-term and short-term 3D properties respectively. To assemble these two kinds of spatial-temporal information and refine the deep learning outcomes, we further introduce an efficient graph-based node selection and label inference method. Experiments have been carried out on two publicly available databases and results demonstrate that the proposed method can obtain competitive performances as compared with other state-of-the-art methods.

本文提出了一种新的三维深度学习网络，用于随机连接的脑部MR图像分割，可以减少层间依赖，提高网络容量。卷积LSTM和3D卷积被用作网络单元来分别捕获长期和短期的3D特性。为了组合这两种时空信息并优化深度学习结果，我们进一步引入了一种高效的基于图的节点选择和标签推理方法。在两个公开可用的数据库上进行了实验，结果表明，与其他最先进的方法相比，所提出的方法可以获得有竞争力的性能。
