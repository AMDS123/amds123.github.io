##### Abstract
Reliable estimation of illuminant chromaticity is crucial for simulating color constancy and for white balancing digital images. However, estimating illuminant chromaticity from a single image is an ill-posed task, in general, and existing solutions typically employ a variety of assumptions and heuristics. In this paper, we present a new, physically-based, approach for estimating illuminant chromaticity from interreflections of light between diffuse surfaces. Our approach assumes that all of the direct illumination in the scene has the same chromaticity, and that at least two areas where interreflections between Lambertian surfaces occur may be detected in the image. No further assumptions or restrictions on the illuminant chromaticty or the shading in the scene are necessary. Our approach is based on representing interreflections as lines in a special 2D color space, and the chromaticity of the illuminant is estimated from the approximate intersection between two or more such lines. Experimental results are reported on a dataset of illumination and surface reflectance spectra, as well as on real images we captured. The results indicate that our approach can yield state-of-the-art results when the interreflections are significant enough to be captured by the camera.
