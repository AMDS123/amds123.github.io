##### Abstract
In this paper, we consider the problem of choosing the optimal scenario of the impact between nodes based on of the introduced criteria for the optimality of the impact. Two criteria for the optimality of the impact, which are called the force of impact and the speed of implementation of the scenario, are considered. To obtain a unique solution of the problem, a multi-criterial assessment of the received scenarios using the Pareto principle was applied. Based on the criteria of a force of impact and the speed of implementation of the scenario, the choice of the optimal scenario of impact was justified. The results and advantages of the proposed approach in comparison with the Kosko model are presented.
