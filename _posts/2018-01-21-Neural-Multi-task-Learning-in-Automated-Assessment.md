##### Abstract
Grammatical error detection and automated essay scoring are two tasks in the area of automated assessment. Traditionally these tasks have been treated independently with different machine learning models and features used for each task. In this paper, we develop a multi-task neural network model that jointly optimises for both tasks, and in particular we show that neural automated essay scoring can be significantly improved. We show that while the essay score provides little evidence to inform grammatical error detection, the essay score is highly influenced by error detection.

语法错误检测和自动作文评分是自动评估领域的两项任务。传统上，这些任务已经被独立处理，具有用于每个任务的不同的机器学习模型和特征。在本文中，我们开发了一个多任务神经网络模型，共同优化这两个任务，特别是我们显示，神经自动化的作文评分可以显着提高。我们表明，虽然作文分数提供了很少的证据来通知语法错误检测，但作文分数高度受错误检测的影响。
