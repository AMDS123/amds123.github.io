##### Abstract
Conversations with non-player characters (NPCs) in games are typically confined to dialogue between a human player and a virtual agent, where the conversation is initiated and controlled by the player. To create richer, more believable environments for players, we need conversational behavior to reflect initiative on the part of the NPCs, including conversations that include multiple NPCs who interact with one another as well as the player. We describe a generative computational model of group conversation between agents, an abstract simulation of discussion in a small group setting. We define conversational interactions in terms of rules for turn taking and interruption, as well as belief change, sentiment change, and emotional response, all of which are dependent on agent personality, context, and relationships. We evaluate our model using a parameterized expressive range analysis, observing correlations between simulation parameters and features of the resulting conversations. This analysis confirms, for example, that character personalities will predict how often they speak, and that heterogeneous groups of characters will generate more belief change.

与游戏中的非玩家角色（NPC）的对话通常局限于人类玩家和虚拟代理之间的对话，其中对话由玩家发起和控制。为了给玩家创造更丰富，更可信的环境，我们需要会话行为来反映NPC的主动性，包括包含多个NPC以及玩家互动的对话。我们描述了代理人之间的群体对话的生成计算模型，一个小组讨论的抽象模拟。我们根据转换和中断的规则以及信念变化，情感变化和情绪反应来定义对话交互，所有这些都依赖于代理人的个性，上下文和关系。我们使用参数化的表情范围分析来评估我们的模型，观察仿真参数与所产生的对话的特征之间的相关性。例如，这个分析证实，角色人物会预测他们说话的频率，而且不同类型的角色会产生更多的信念改变。
