##### Abstract
Agent based simulation of social organizations, via the investigation of agents' training and learning tactics and strategies, has been inspired by the ability of humans to learn from social environments which are rich in agents, interactions and partial or hidden information. Such richness is a source of complexity that an effective learner has to be able to navigate. This paper focuses on the investigation of the impact of the environmental complexity on the game playing-and-learning behavior of synthetic agents. We demonstrate our approach using two independent turn-based zero-sum games as the basis of forming social events which are characterized both by competition and cooperation. The paper's key highlight is that as the complexity of a social environment changes, an effective player has to adapt its learning and playing profile to maintain a given performance profile

基于代理人的社会组织模拟，通过对代理人培训和学习策略和策略的调查，受到人类从充满代理人，互动和部分或隐藏信息的社会环境中学习的能力的启发。这种丰富性是有效学习者必须能够导航的复杂性的源泉。本文重点研究环境复杂性对合成代理人游戏玩耍和学习行为的影响。我们使用两个独立的回合制零和游戏来展示我们的方法，作为形成以竞争和合作为特征的社交活动的基础。该论文的主要亮点是，随着社会环境的复杂性发生变化，有效的参与者必须调整其学习和播放资料以维持特定的表现形象。
