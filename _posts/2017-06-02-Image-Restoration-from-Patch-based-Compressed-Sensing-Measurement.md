##### Abstract
A series of methods have been proposed to reconstruct an image from compressively sensed random measurement, but most of them have high time complexity and are inappropriate for patch-based compressed sensing capture, because of their serious blocky artifacts in the restoration results. In this paper, we present a non-iterative image reconstruction method from patch-based compressively sensed random measurement. Our method features two cascaded networks based on residual convolution neural network to learn the end-to-end full image restoration, which is capable of reconstructing image patches and removing the blocky effect with low time cost. Experimental results on synthetic and real data show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art compressive sensing (CS) reconstruction methods with patch-based CS measurement. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in more general setting, we apply the de-block process in our method to JPEG compression artifacts removal and achieve outstanding performance as well.

提出了一系列基于压缩感知随机测量的图像重建方法，但其中大部分方法具有较高的时间复杂度，不适用于基于斑块的压缩感知捕获，这是因为在修复结果上存在严重的块状伪影。在本文中，我们提出了一种基于斑块压缩感测随机测量的非迭代图像重建方法。我们的方法具有两个基于残余卷积神经网络的级联网络来学习端到端的全图像恢复，能够以较低的时间成本重建图像块并消除块效应。对合成和实际数据的实验结果表明，我们的方法优于基于补丁的CS测量的现代压缩感测（CS）重建方法。为了展示我们的方法在更一般的设置中的有效性，我们将去块处理应用于JPEG压缩伪像去除，并取得了出色的性能。
