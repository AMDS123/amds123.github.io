##### Abstract
This thesis focuses on gaining linguistic insights into textual discussions on a word level. It was of special interest to distinguish messages that constructively contribute to a discussion from those that are detrimental to them. Thereby, we wanted to determine whether "I"- and "You"-messages are indicators for either of the two discussion styles. These messages are nowadays often used in guidelines for successful communication. Although their effects have been successfully evaluated multiple times, a large-scale analysis has never been conducted. Thus, we used Wikipedia Articles for Deletion (short: AfD) discussions together with the records of blocked users and developed a fully automated creation of an annotated data set. In this data set, messages were labelled either constructive or disruptive. We applied binary classifiers to the data to determine characteristic words for both discussion styles. Thereby, we also investigated whether function words like pronouns and conjunctions play an important role in distinguishing the two. We found that "You"-messages were a strong indicator for disruptive messages which matches their attributed effects on communication. However, we found "I"-messages to be indicative for disruptive messages as well which is contrary to their attributed effects. The importance of function words could neither be confirmed nor refuted. Other characteristic words for either communication style were not found. Yet, the results suggest that a different model might represent disruptive and constructive messages in textual discussions better.

本论文的重点是在文字层面上获取对文本讨论的语言学见解。把建设性地有利于讨论的信息与不利于讨论的信息区分开来是特别有意义的。因此，我们想确定“I” - 和“You” - 消息是否是两种讨论风格的指标。这些信息现在经常用于成功交流的指导原则。虽然它们的效果已经成功地被多次评估，但从未进行过大规模的分析。因此，我们使用Wikipedia Articles for Deletion（简称：AfD）讨论连同被阻止用户的记录，并开发了一个完全自动创建的注释数据集。在这个数据集中，消息被标记为建设性或破坏性的。我们将二元分类器应用于数据，以确定两种讨论风格的特征词。因此，我们还研究了代词和连词之类的功能词是否在区分二者中起重要作用。我们发现，“你” - 消息是一个强烈的指示符，它们与通信的属性效应相匹配。但是，我们发现“我” - 这个消息也是破坏性信息的指示，这与它们的归属效应相反。功能词的重要性既不能被证实也不能被驳倒。没有找到任何沟通风格的其他特征词。然而，结果表明，不同的模式可能更好地代表文本讨论中的破坏性和建设性的信息。
