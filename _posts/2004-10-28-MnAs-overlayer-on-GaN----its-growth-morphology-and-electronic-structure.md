##### Abstract
Spontaneous formation of grains has been observed for the MnAs layer grown by means of MBE on the GaN(0001)-(1x1) surface. Electronic structure of the system was investigated in situ by resonant photoemission spectroscopy. Density of the valence band states of MnAs and its changes due to increase of the layer thickness were revealed.
