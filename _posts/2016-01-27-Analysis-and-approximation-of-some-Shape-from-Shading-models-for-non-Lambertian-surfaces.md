##### Abstract
The reconstruction of a 3D object or a scene is a classical inverse problem in Computer Vision. In the case of a single image this is called the Shape-from-Shading (SfS) problem and it is known to be ill-posed even in a simplified version like the vertical light source case. A huge number of works deals with the orthographic SfS problem based on the Lambertian reflectance model, the most common and simplest model which leads to an eikonal type equation when the light source is on the vertical axis. In this paper we want to study non-Lambertian models since they are more realistic and suitable whenever one has to deal with different kind of surfaces, rough or specular. We will present a unified mathematical formulation of some popular orthographic non-Lambertian models, considering vertical and oblique light directions as well as different viewer positions. These models lead to more complex stationary nonlinear partial differential equations of Hamilton-Jacobi type which can be regarded as the generalization of the classical eikonal equation corresponding to the Lambertian case. However, all the equations corresponding to the models considered here (Oren-Nayar and Phong) have a similar structure so we can look for weak solutions to this class in the viscosity solution framework. Via this unified approach, we are able to develop a semi-Lagrangian approximation scheme for the Oren-Nayar and the Phong model and to prove a general convergence result. Numerical simulations on synthetic and real images will illustrate the effectiveness of this approach and the main features of the scheme, also comparing the results with previous results in the literature.

3D对象或场景的重建是计算机视觉中经典的逆问题。在单幅图像的情况下，这被称为形状从阴影（SfS）问题，并且即使在像垂直光源的情况下的简化版本中也是不适合的。大量作品基于朗伯反射模型处理正交SfS问题，这是最常见和最简单的模型，当光源处于垂直轴上时，导致光子型方程。在本文中，我们想研究非朗伯模型，因为它们更加逼真，并且适用于任何需要处理不同类型的粗糙或镜面的表面。我们将呈现一些流行的正交非朗伯模型的统一数学公式，考虑垂直和倾斜的光方向以及不同的观看者位置。这些模型导致更复杂的哈密顿 - 雅可比类型的平稳非线性偏微分方程，其可以看作是对应于朗伯情况的经典方程的泛化。然而，与这里考虑的模型（Oren-Nayar和Phong）相对应的所有方程式都具有类似的结构，所以我们可以在粘度解决方案框架中寻找这个类的弱解。通过这种统一的方法，我们能够为Oren-Nayar和Phong模型开发一个半拉格朗日近似方案，并证明一个一般的收敛结果。数值模拟合成和真实图像将说明这种方法的有效性和方案的主要特点，也比较结果与以前的文献中的结果。
