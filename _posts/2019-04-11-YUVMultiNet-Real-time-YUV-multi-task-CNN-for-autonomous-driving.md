##### Abstract
In this paper, we propose a multi-task convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture optimized for a low power automotive grade SoC. We introduce a network based on a unified architecture where the encoder is shared among the two tasks namely detection and segmentation. The pro-posed network runs at 25FPS for 1280x800 resolution. We briefly discuss the methods used to optimize the network architecture such as using native YUV image directly, optimization of layers &amp; feature maps and applying quantization. We also focus on memory bandwidth in our design as convolutions are data intensives and most SOCs are bandwidth bottlenecked. We then demonstrate the efficiency of our proposed network for a dedicated CNN accelerators presenting the key performance indicators (KPI) for the detection and segmentation tasks obtained from the hardware execution and the corresponding run-time.
