##### Abstract
Transfer learning is a recent field of machine learning research that aims to resolve the challenge of dealing with insufficient training data in the domain of interest. This is a particular issue with traditional deep neural networks where a large amount of training data is needed. Recently, StochasticNets was proposed to take advantage of sparse connectivity in order to decrease the number of parameters that needs to be learned, which in turn may relax training data size requirements. In this paper, we study the efficacy of transfer learning on StochasticNet frameworks. Experimental results show ~7% improvement on StochasticNet performance when the transfer learning is applied in training step.

转移学习是机器学习研究的一个新近领域，旨在解决处理感兴趣领域的训练数据不足的挑战。对于需要大量训练数据的传统深度神经网络而言，这是一个特别的问题。最近，StochasticNet被提出来利用稀疏连通性来减少需要学习的参数的数量，从而可以放宽训练数据大小的要求。在本文中，我们研究了随机网络框架中转移学习的效果。实验结果表明，当转移学习应用于训练步时，随机网络性能提高约7％。
