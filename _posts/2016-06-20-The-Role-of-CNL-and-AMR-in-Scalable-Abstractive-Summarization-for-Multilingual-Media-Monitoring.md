##### Abstract
In the era of Big Data and Deep Learning, there is a common view that machine learning approaches are the only way to cope with the robust and scalable information extraction and summarization. It has been recently proposed that the CNL approach could be scaled up, building on the concept of embedded CNL and, thus, allowing for CNL-based information extraction from e.g. normative or medical texts that are rather controlled by nature but still infringe the boundaries of CNL. Although it is arguable if CNL can be exploited to approach the robust wide-coverage semantic parsing for use cases like media monitoring, its potential becomes much more obvious in the opposite direction: generation of story highlights from the summarized AMR graphs, which is in the focus of this position paper.

在大数据和深度学习的时代，人们普遍认为机器学习方法是应对强大和可扩展的信息提取和汇总的唯一方法。最近已经提出，可以基于嵌入式CNL的概念来扩大CNL方法，从而允许例如从基于CNL的信息提取。规范性或医学文本，而这些文本是由自然控制的，但仍然侵犯了CNL的边界。虽然可以利用CNL来处理像媒体监视这样的用例的强大的覆盖范围的语义分析，但是它的潜力在相反的方向上变得更加明显：从总结的AMR图形生成故事亮点，这在这个立场文件的重点。
