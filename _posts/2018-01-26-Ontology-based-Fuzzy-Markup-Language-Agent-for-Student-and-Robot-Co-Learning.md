##### Abstract
An intelligent robot agent based on domain ontology, machine learning mechanism, and Fuzzy Markup Language (FML) for students and robot co-learning is presented in this paper. The machine-human co-learning model is established to help various students learn the mathematical concepts based on their learning ability and performance. Meanwhile, the robot acts as a teacher's assistant to co-learn with children in the class. The FML-based knowledge base and rule base are embedded in the robot so that the teachers can get feedback from the robot on whether students make progress or not. Next, we inferred students' learning performance based on learning content's difficulty and students' ability, concentration level, as well as teamwork sprit in the class. Experimental results show that learning with the robot is helpful for disadvantaged and below-basic children. Moreover, the accuracy of the intelligent FML-based agent for student learning is increased after machine learning mechanism.

本文提出了一种基于领域本体，机器学习机制和模糊标记语言（FML）的智能机器人代理学习机器人协同学习方法。建立机器 - 人类联合学习模型，帮助不同的学生根据自己的学习能力和表现学习数学概念。同时，机器人作为教师的助手，与班上的孩子们共同学习。基于FML的知识库和规则库被嵌入到机器人中，使得教师可以从机器人获得关于学生是否进步的反馈。接下来，我们根据学习内容的难度和学生的能力，集中度以及课堂上的团队合作精神来推断学生的学习成绩。实验结果表明，机器人学习有助于弱势群体和低于基础的孩子。另外，机器学习机制后，基于智能FML的学生学习代理的准确性也提高了。
