##### Abstract
Plant classification and identification has so far been an important and difficult task. In this paper, an efficient and systematic approach for extracting the leaf architecture characters from captured digital images is proposed. The input image is first pre-processed in five steps to be prepared for feature extraction. In the second stage, methods for extracting different architectural features are studied using various mathematical and computational methods. Also, the classification rules for mapping the calculated values of each feature to semantic botanical terms in proposed. Compared with previous studies, the proposed method combines extracted features of an image with specific knowledge of leaf architecture in the domain of botany to provide a comprehensive framework for both computer engineers and botanist. Finally, Based on the proposed method, experiments on the classification of the ImagerCLEF 2012 dataset has been performed with promising results.

迄今为止，植物分类和鉴定是一项重要而艰巨的任务。本文提出了一种从捕获的数字图像中提取叶子结构特征的高效系统化方法。输入图像首先分五步预处理，准备进行特征提取。在第二阶段，使用各种数学和计算方法研究提取不同建筑特征的方法。此外，分类规则映射计算值的每个功能语义植物学术语中提出。与以往的研究相比，该方法在植物学领域将图像提取的特征与叶结构的特定知识相结合，为计算机工程师和植物学家提供了一个全面的框架。最后，基于所提出的方法，对ImagerCLEF 2012数据集进行了分类实验，结果令人满意。
