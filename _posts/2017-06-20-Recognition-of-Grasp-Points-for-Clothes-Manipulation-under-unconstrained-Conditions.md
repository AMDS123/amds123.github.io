##### Abstract
In this work a system for recognizing grasp points in RGB-D images is proposed. This system is intended to be used by a domestic robot when deploying clothes lying at a random position on a table. By taking into consideration that the grasp points are usually near key parts of clothing, such as the waist of pants or the neck of a shirt. The proposed system attempts to detect these key parts first, using a local multivariate contour that adapts its shape accordingly. Then, the proposed system applies the Vessel Enhancement filter to identify wrinkles in the clothes, allowing to compute a roughness index for the clothes. Finally, by mixing (i) the key part contours and (ii) the roughness information obtained by the vessel filter, the system is able to recognize grasp points for unfolding a piece of clothing. The recognition system is validated using realistic RGB-D images of different cloth types.

本文提出了一种识别RGB-D图像抓点的系统。这个系统是用来在一个家庭机器人使用时，躺在桌子上随机位置的衣服。考虑到抓点通常靠近服装的关键部位，例如裤子的腰部或衬衫的脖子。所提出的系统首先尝试检测这些关键部分，使用局部多变量轮廓来适应其形状。然后，所提出的系统应用容器增强过滤器来识别衣服中的皱纹，从而允许计算衣服的粗糙度指数。最后，通过混合（i）关键部位轮廓和（ii）通过容器过滤器获得的粗糙度信息，系统能够识别展开一件衣服的抓取点。识别系统使用不同布类型的逼真RGB-D图像进行验证。
