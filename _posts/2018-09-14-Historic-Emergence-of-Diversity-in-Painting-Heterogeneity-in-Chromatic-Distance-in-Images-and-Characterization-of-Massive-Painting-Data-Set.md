##### Abstract
Painting is an art form that has long functioned as a major channel for the creative expression and communication of humans, its evolution taking place under an interplay with the science, technology, and social environments of the times. Therefore, understanding the process based on comprehensive data could shed light on how humans acted and manifested creatively under changing conditions. Yet, there exist few systematic frameworks that characterize the process for painting, which would require robust statistical methods for defining painting characteristics and identifying human's creative developments, and data of high quality and sufficient quantity. Here we propose that the color contrast of a painting image signifying the heterogeneity in inter-pixel chromatic distance can be a useful representation of its style, integrating both the color and geometry. From the color contrasts of paintings from a large-scale, comprehensive archive of 179,853 high-quality images spanning several centuries we characterize the temporal evolutionary patterns of paintings, and present a deep study of an extraordinary expansion in creative diversity and individuality that came to define the modern era.

##### Abstract (translated by Google)
绘画是一种艺术形式，长期以来一直是人类创造性表达和交流的主要渠道，其演变发生在与时代的科学，技术和社会环境的相互作用下。因此，基于综合数据理解过程可以揭示人类在不断变化的条件下如何创造性地表现和表现。然而，很少有系统框架来描绘绘画过程，这需要强大的统计方法来定义绘画特征和识别人类的创造性发展，以及高质量和足够数量的数据。在这里，我们提出绘画图像的颜色对比度，表示像素间色度距离的异质性，可以是其风格的有用表示，整合了颜色和几何。从几百年来179,853个高质量图像的大型综合档案的绘画色彩对比中，我们描绘了绘画的时间演化模式，并对创作多样性和个性的非凡扩展进行了深入研究。现代时代。
