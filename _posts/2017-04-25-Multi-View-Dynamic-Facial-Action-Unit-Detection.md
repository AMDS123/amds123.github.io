##### Abstract
We propose a novel convolutional neural network architecture to address the fine-grained recognition problem of multi-view dynamic facial action unit detection. We leverage recent gains in large-scale object recognition by formulating the task of predicting the presence or absence of a specific action unit in a still image of a human face as holistic classification. We then explore the design space of our approach by considering both shared and independent representations for separate action units, and also different CNN architectures for combining color and motion information. We then move to the novel setup of the FERA 2017 Challenge, in which we propose a multi-view extension of our approach that operates by first predicting the viewpoint from which the video was taken, and then evaluating an ensemble of action unit detectors that were trained for that specific viewpoint. Our approach is holistic, efficient, and modular, since new action units can be easily included in the overall system. Our approach significantly outperforms the baseline of the FERA 2017 Challenge, which was the previous state-of-the-art in multi-view dynamic action unit detection, with an absolute improvement of 14%.

我们提出了一种新的卷积神经网络体系结构来解决多视角动态面部动作单元检测的细粒度识别问题。通过将人脸静止图像中存在或不存在特定动作单元的任务制定为整体分类，我们利用最近在大规模目标识别中的获益。然后，我们通过考虑单独的动作单元的共享和独立表示以及用于组合颜色和运动信息的不同的CNN体​​系结构来探索我们的方法的设计空间。然后，我们转向“口袋2017挑战”的小说设置，其中我们提出了一种多视角的扩展方法，首先预测视频的观点，然后评估一个行动单元探测器的集合训练有素的观点。我们的方法是整体，高效和模块化的，因为新的行动单位可以很容易地包括在整个系统中。我们的方法明显优于“2017挑战”的基准，这是多视角动态单位检测的先前技术，绝对提高了14％。
