##### Abstract
Machine learning about language can be improved by supplying it with specific knowledge and sources of external information. We present here a new version of the linked open data resource ConceptNet that is particularly well suited to be used with modern NLP techniques such as word embeddings. ConceptNet is a knowledge graph that connects words and phrases of natural language with labeled edges. Its knowledge is collected from many sources that include expert-created resources, crowd-sourcing, and games with a purpose. It is designed to represent the general knowledge involved in understanding language, improving natural language applications by allowing the application to better understand the meanings behind the words people use. When ConceptNet is combined with word embeddings acquired from distributional semantics (such as word2vec), it provides applications with understanding that they would not acquire from distributional semantics alone, nor from narrower resources such as WordNet or DBPedia. We demonstrate this with state-of-the-art results on intrinsic evaluations of word relatedness that translate into improvements on applications of word vectors, including solving SAT-style analogies.

机器学习语言可以通过提供特定的知识和外部信息来改善。我们在这里展示了一个链接的开放数据资源ConceptNet的新版本，特别适合与现代NLP技术（如字嵌入）一起使用。 ConceptNet是一种将自然语言的单词和短语与标记的边缘连接起来的知识图形。它的知识是从许多来源收集的，包括专家创建的资源，众包和有目的的游戏。它旨在表示理解语言的一般知识，通过允许应用程序更好地理解人们使用的词语的含义来改进自然语言应用程序。当ConceptNet与从分布式语义（如word2vec）中获取的单词嵌入相结合时，它为应用程序提供了理解，它们不会从单独的分布式语义获取，也不能从较窄的资源（如WordNet或DBPedia）获取。我们用与语言相关性的内在评估相关的最新结果来证明这一点，即将语言向量的应用改进，包括解决SAT风格的类比。
