##### Abstract
Motion segmentation is currently an active area of research in computer Vision. The task of comparing different methods of motion segmentation is complicated by the fact that researchers may use subtly different definitions of the problem. Questions such as "Which objects are moving?", "What is background?", and "How can we use motion of the camera to segment objects, whether they are static or moving?" are clearly related to each other, but lead to different algorithms, and imply different versions of the ground truth. This report has two goals. The first is to offer a precise definition of motion segmentation so that the intent of an algorithm is as well-defined as possible. The second is to report on new versions of three previously existing data sets that are compatible with this definition. We hope that this more detailed definition, and the three data sets that go with it, will allow more meaningful comparisons of certain motion segmentation methods.

运动分割是目前计算机视觉领域的一个研究热点。比较不同的运动分割方法的任务是复杂的，因为研究人员可能使用微妙的不同的问题的定义。诸如“哪些物体正在移动？”，“什么是背景？”以及“我们如何使用摄像机的运动来分割物体，无论它们是静止的还是移动的？显然是相互关联的，但会导致不同的算法，并暗示着不同的版本。这份报告有两个目标。首先是提供运动分割的精确定义，以便算法的意图尽可能地被定义好。其次是报告与这个定义兼容的三个先前存在的数据集的新版本。我们希望这个更详细的定义以及与之相关的三个数据集将允许对某些运动分割方法进行更有意义的比较。
