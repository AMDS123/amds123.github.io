##### Abstract
A large body of compelling evidence has been accumulated demonstrating that embodiment - the agent's physical setup, including its shape, materials, sensors and actuators - is constitutive for any form of cognition and as a consequence, models of cognition need to be embodied. In contrast to methods from empirical sciences to study cognition, robots can be freely manipulated and virtually all key variables of their embodiment and control programs can be systematically varied. As such, they provide an extremely powerful tool of investigation. We present a robotic bottom-up or developmental approach, focusing on three stages: (a) low-level behaviors like walking and reflexes, (b) learning regularities in sensorimotor spaces, and (c) human-like cognition. We also show that robotic based research is not only a productive path to deepening our understanding of cognition, but that robots can strongly benefit from human-like cognition in order to become more autonomous, robust, resilient, and safe.

已经积累了大量令人信服的证据，证明了代理人的身体设置（包括其形状，材料，传感器和执行器）是否构成任何形式的认知，因此需要体现认知模型。与经验科学研究认知的方法相比，机器人可以自由操纵，实际上所有关键变量的实施和控制程序都可以有系统地变化。因此，它们提供了一个非常有力的调查工具。我们提出了一个机器人自下而上或发展的方法，重点放在三个阶段：（一）低级行为，如步行和反射，（二）学习规则感觉运动空间，（三）人类的认知。我们还表明，基于机器人的研究不仅是加深我们对认知理解的有效途径，而且机器人能够从类人的认知中获得强大的利益，从而变得更加自主，健壮，有弹性和安全。
