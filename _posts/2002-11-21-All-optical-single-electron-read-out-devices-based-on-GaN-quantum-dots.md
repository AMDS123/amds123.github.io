##### Abstract
We study few-particle interactions in GaN-coupled quantum dots and discuss how the built-in field characteristic of these structures strongly reinforce dipole-dipole and dipole-monopole interactions. We introduce a semi-analytical model which allows for a rapid and easy estimate of the magnitude of few-particle interactions and whose predictions are closer than 10% to ``exact'' results. We apply our study to the design of an all-optical read-out device which exploits long-range dipole-monopole interactions and may be also used to monitor the charge status of a quantum dot system.
