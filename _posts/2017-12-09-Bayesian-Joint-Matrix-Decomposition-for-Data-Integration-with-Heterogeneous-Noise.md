##### Abstract
Matrix decomposition is a popular and fundamental approach in machine learning and data mining. It has been successfully applied into various fields. Most matrix decomposition methods focus on decomposing a data matrix from one single source. However, it is common that data are from different sources with heterogeneous noise. A few of matrix decomposition methods have been extended for such multi-view data integration and pattern discovery. While only few methods were designed to consider the heterogeneity of noise in such multi-view data for data integration explicitly. To this end, we propose a joint matrix decomposition framework (BJMD), which models the heterogeneity of noise by Gaussian distribution in a Bayesian framework. We develop two algorithms to solve this model: one is a variational Bayesian inference algorithm, which makes full use of the posterior distribution; and another is a maximum a posterior algorithm, which is more scalable and can be easily paralleled. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that BJMD considering the heterogeneity of noise is superior or competitive to the state-of-the-art methods.

矩阵分解是机器学习和数据挖掘中流行和基本的方法。已成功应用于各个领域。大多数矩阵分解方法着重于从单一来源分解数据矩阵。然而，数据来自异质噪声的不同来源是很常见的。一些矩阵分解方法已经被扩展用于这种多视图数据集成和模式发现。虽然只有很少的方法被设计来明确地考虑用于数据整合的这种多视图数据中的噪声的异质性。为此，我们提出了一个联合矩阵分解框架（BJMD），它在贝叶斯框架中用高斯分布来模拟噪声的异质性。我们开发了两种算法来解决这个模型：一种是变分贝叶斯推理算法，它充分利用了后验分布;另一种是最大后验算法，具有更高的可扩展性，并且易于并行处理。对合成和现实世界的数据集进行的大量实验表明，考虑到噪声的异质性，BJMD优于或竞争最先进的方法。
