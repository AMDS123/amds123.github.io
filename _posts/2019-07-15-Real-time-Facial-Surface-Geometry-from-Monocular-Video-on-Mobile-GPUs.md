##### Abstract
We present an end-to-end neural network-based model for inferring an approximate 3D mesh representation of a human face from single camera input for AR applications. The relatively dense mesh model of 468 vertices is well-suited for face-based AR effects. The proposed model demonstrates super-realtime inference speed on mobile GPUs (100-1000+ FPS, depending on the device and model variant) and a high prediction quality that is comparable to the variance in manual annotations of the same image.
