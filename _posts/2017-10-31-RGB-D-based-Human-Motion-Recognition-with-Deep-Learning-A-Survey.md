##### Abstract
Human motion recognition is one of the most important branches of human-centered research activities. In recent years, motion recognition based on RGB-D data has attracted much attention. Along with the development in artificial intelligence, deep learning techniques have gained remarkable success in computer vision. In particular, convolutional neural networks (CNN) have achieved great success for image-based tasks, and recurrent neural networks (RNN) are renowned for sequence-based problems. Specifically, deep learning methods based on the CNN and RNN architectures have been adopted for motion recognition using RGB-D data. In this paper, a detailed overview of recent advances in RGB-D-based motion recognition is presented. The reviewed methods are broadly categorized into four groups, depending on the modality adopted for recognition: RGB-based, depth-based, skeleton-based and multi-modal-based. As a survey focused on the application of deep learning to RGB-D-based motion recognition, we explicitly discuss the advantages and limitations of existing techniques. Particularly, we highlighted the methods of encoding spatial-temporal-structural information inherent in video sequence, and discuss potential directions for future research.

人体运动识别是以人为本的研究活动中最重要的分支之一。近年来，基于RGB-D数据的运动识别引起了越来越多的关注。随着人工智能的发展，深度学习技术在计算机视觉领域取得了显着的成就。特别是，卷积神经网络（CNN）在基于图像的任务中取得了巨大的成功，递归神经网络（RNN）以基于序列的问题而闻名。具体而言，基于CNN和RNN体系结构的深度学习方法已经被用于使用RGB-D数据的运动识别。本文详细介绍了基于RGB-D的运动识别的最新进展。已评估的方法大致分为四类，取决于所采用的识别方式：基于RGB的，基于深度的，基于骨架的和基于多模式的。作为一个深度学习应用基于RGB-D的运动识别的调查，我们明确地讨论了现有技术的优点和局限性。特别强调了对视频序列中固有的空间 - 时间 - 结构信息进行编码的方法，并对今后的研究方向进行了探讨。
