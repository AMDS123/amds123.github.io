##### Abstract
Image Classification based on BOW (Bag-of-words) has broad application prospect in pattern recognition field but the shortcomings are existed because of single feature and low classification accuracy. To this end we combine three ingredients: (i) Three features with functions of mutual complementation are adopted to describe the images, including PHOW (Pyramid Histogram of Words), PHOC (Pyramid Histogram of Color) and PHOG (Pyramid Histogram of Orientated Gradients). (ii) The improvement of traditional BOW model is presented by using dense sample and an improved K-means clustering method for constructing the visual dictionary. (iii) An adaptive feature-weight adjusted image categorization algorithm based on the SVM and the fusion of multiple features is adopted. Experiments carried out on Caltech 101 database confirm the validity of the proposed approach. From the experimental results can be seen that the classification accuracy rate of the proposed method is improved by 7%-17% higher than that of the traditional BOW methods. This algorithm makes full use of global, local and spatial information and has significant improvements to the classification accuracy.

基于BOW（Bag-of-words）的图像分类在模式识别领域具有广泛的应用前景，但由于特征单一，分类精度低，存在缺陷。为此，我们结合三个要素：（一）具有相互补充功能的三个特征被用来描述图像，包括PHOW（金字塔直方图），PHOC（金字塔颜色直方图）和PHOG（金字塔定向梯度直方图） 。 （2）利用稠密样本和改进的K均值聚类方法构建视觉词典，提出了传统BOW模型的改进。 （iii）采用基于支持向量机的多特征融合的自适应特征权重调整图像分类算法。在加州理工学院101数据库上进行的实验证实了所提出方法的有效性。从实验结果可以看出，该方法的分类准确率比传统的BOW方法提高了7％〜17％。该算法充分利用全局，局部和空间信息，对分类精度有显着提高。
