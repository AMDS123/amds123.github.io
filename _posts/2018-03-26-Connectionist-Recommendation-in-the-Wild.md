##### Abstract
The aggregate behaviors of users can collectively encode deep semantic information about the objects with which they interact. In this paper, we demonstrate novel ways in which the synthesis of these data can illuminate the terrain of users' environment and support them in their decision making and wayfinding. A novel application of Recurrent Neural Networks and skip-gram models, approaches popularized by their application to modeling language, are brought to bear on student university enrollment sequences to create vector representations of courses and map out traversals across them. We present demonstrations of how scrutability from these neural networks can be gained and how the combination of these techniques can be seen as an evolution of content tagging and a means for a recommender to balance user preferences inferred from data with those explicitly specified. From validation of the models to the development of a UI, we discuss additional requisite functionality informed by the results of a field study leading to the ultimate deployment of the system at a university.

用户的聚合行为可以共同编码有关它们与之交互的对象的深层语义信息。在本文中，我们展示了这些数据综合的新方法，可以照亮用户环境的地形，并支持他们进行决策和寻路。 Recurrent Neural Networks和skip-gram模型的一种新颖应用，通过它们在建模语言中的应用而得到推广，被应用于学生大学录取序列，以创建课程的矢量表示并绘制遍历它们的遍历。我们展示了如何从这些神经网络获得可察觉性，以及这些技术的组合如何被看作是内容标记的演化过程，以及推荐人如何平衡从数据推断的用户偏好与明确指定的方式。从验证模型到开发用户界面，我们讨论了导致系统在大学最终部署的现场研究结果所需的额外必要功能。
