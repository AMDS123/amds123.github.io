##### Abstract
We design envy-free mechanisms for the allocation of rooms and rent payments among roommates. We achieve four objectives: (1) each agent is allowed to make a report that expresses her preference about violating her budget constraint, a feature not achieved by mechanisms that only elicit quasi-linear reports; (2) these reports are finite dimensional; (3) computation is feasible in polynomial time; and (4) incentive properties of envy-free mechanisms that elicit quasi-linear reports are preserved.
