##### Abstract
Linear dimensionality reduction techniques are powerful tools for image analysis as they allow the identification of important features in a data set. In particular, nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) has become very popular as it is able to extract sparse, localized and easily interpretable features by imposing an additive combination of nonnegative basis elements. Nonnegative matrix underapproximation (NMU) is a closely related technique that has the advantage to identify features sequentially. In this paper, we propose a variant of NMU that is particularly well suited for image analysis as it incorporates the spatial information, that is, it takes into account the fact that neighboring pixels are more likely to be contained in the same features, and favors the extraction of localized features by looking for sparse basis elements. We show that our new approach competes favorably with comparable state-of-the-art techniques on synthetic, facial and hyperspectral image data sets.

线性降维技术是图像分析的强大工具，因为它们允许识别数据集中的重要特征。特别是，非负矩阵分解（NMF）已经变得非常流行，因为它能够通过施加非负基础元素的加法组合来提取稀疏的，局部的和容易解释的特征。非负矩阵不对称（NMU）是一种密切相关的技术，具有顺序识别特征的优点。在本文中，我们提出了NMU的一个变体，它特别适合于图像分析，因为它包含了空间信息，也就是说，考虑到相邻像素更可能包含在相同的特征中，通过寻找稀疏的基本元素来提取局部特征。我们表明，我们的新方法在合成，面部和高光谱图像数据集上与可比较的最新技术相媲美。
