##### Abstract
Recently, increasing attention has been directed to the study of the speech emotion recognition, in which global acoustic features of an utterance are mostly used to eliminate the content differences. However, the expression of speech emotion is a dynamic process, which is reflected through dynamic durations, energies, and some other prosodic information when one speaks. In this paper, a novel local dynamic pitch probability distribution feature, which is obtained by drawing the histogram, is proposed to improve the accuracy of speech emotion recognition. Compared with most of the previous works using global features, the proposed method takes advantage of the local dynamic information conveyed by the emotional speech. Several experiments on Berlin Database of Emotional Speech are conducted to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method. The experimental results demonstrate that the local dynamic information obtained with the proposed method is more effective for speech emotion recognition than the traditional global features.

近来，越来越多的注意力集中在语音情感识别的研究上，其中话语的全局声学特征主要用于消除内容差异。然而，言语情绪的表达是一个动态过程，通过动态持续时间，能量和其他一些说话时的韵律信息来反映。为了提高语音情感识别的准确性，本文提出了一种通过绘制直方图得到的局部动态音高概率分布特征。与以往大多数使用全局特征的作品相比，该方法利用情感语音传递的局部动态信息。对柏林情绪言语数据库进行了几次实验，验证了该方法的有效性。实验结果表明，所提出的方法获得的局部动态信息比传统的全局特征更有效的语音情感识别。
