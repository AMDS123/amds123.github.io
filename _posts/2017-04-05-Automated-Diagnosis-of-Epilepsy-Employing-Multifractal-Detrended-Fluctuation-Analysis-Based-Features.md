##### Abstract
This contribution reports an application of MultiFractal Detrended Fluctuation Analysis, MFDFA based novel feature extraction technique for automated detection of epilepsy. In fractal geometry, Multifractal Detrended Fluctuation Analysis MFDFA is a popular technique to examine the self-similarity of a nonlinear, chaotic and noisy time series. In the present research work, EEG signals representing healthy, interictal (seizure free) and ictal activities (seizure) are acquired from an existing available database. The acquired EEG signals of different states are at first analyzed using MFDFA. To requisite the time series singularity quantification at local and global scales, a novel set of fourteen different features. Suitable feature ranking employing students t-test has been done to select the most statistically significant features which are henceforth being used as inputs to a support vector machines (SVM) classifier for the classification of different EEG signals. Eight different classification problems have been presented in this paper and it has been observed that the overall classification accuracy using MFDFA based features are reasonably satisfactory for all classification problems. The performance of the proposed method are also found to be quite commensurable and in some cases even better when compared with the results published in existing literature studied on the similar data set.

该贡献报告了多分形去除波动分析的应用，基于MFDFA的新颖特征提取技术用于自动检测癫痫。在分形几何中，多重分形去相关波动分析MFDFA是检验非线性，混沌和噪声时间序列的自相似性的流行技术。在目前的研究工作中，代表健康，间歇性（无发作）和发作活动（发作）的脑电信号是从现有的数据库中获取的。首先采用MFDFA分析获取的不同状态的脑电信号。为了要求本地和全球尺度上的时间序列奇异量化，一套新颖的十四个不同的特征。已经完成了使用学生t检验的合适的特征排序，以选择以后被用作用于不同EEG信号的分类的支持向量机（SVM）分类器的输入的统计上显着的特征。本文提出了八种不同的分类问题，并且已经观察到使用基于MFDFA的特征的整体分类准确度对于所有分类问题是合理令人满意的。所提出的方法的性能也被发现是相当可比较的，并且在某些情况下甚至比现有文献中公布的类似数据集上研究的结果更好。
