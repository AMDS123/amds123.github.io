##### Abstract
Network embeddings, which learn low-dimensional representations for each vertex in a large-scale network, have received considerable attention in recent years. For a wide range of applications, vertices in a network are typically accompanied by rich textual information such as user profiles, paper abstracts, etc. We propose to incorporate semantic features into network embeddings by matching important words between text sequences for all pairs of vertices. We introduce a word-by-word alignment framework that measures the compatibility of embeddings between word pairs, and then adaptively accumulates these alignment features with a simple yet effective aggregation function. In experiments, we evaluate the proposed framework on three real-world benchmarks for downstream tasks, including link prediction and multi-label vertex classification. Results demonstrate that our model outperforms state-of-the-art network embedding methods by a large margin.

近年来，网络嵌入在大规模网络中学习每个顶点的低维表示，已经引起了相当多的关注。对于广泛的应用，网络中的顶点通常伴随有丰富的文本信息，例如用户简档，纸张摘要等。我们建议通过匹配所有顶点对的文本序列之间的重要单词，将语义特征结合到网络嵌入中。我们引入逐字对齐框架来测量字对之间嵌入的兼容性，然后通过简单而有效的聚合函数自适应地累积这些对齐特征。在实验中，我们在下游任务的三个真实世界基准上评估所提出的框架，包括链接预测和多标签顶点分类。结果表明，我们的模型大大优于最先进的网络嵌入方法。
