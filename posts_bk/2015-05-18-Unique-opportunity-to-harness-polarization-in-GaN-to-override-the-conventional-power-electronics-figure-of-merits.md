##### Abstract
Owing to the large breakdown electric field, wide bandgap semiconductors such as SiC, GaN, Ga2O3 and diamond based power devices are the focus for next generation power switching applications. The unipolar trade-off relationship between the area specific-on resistance and breakdown voltage is often employed to compare the performance limitation among various materials. The GaN material system has a unique advantage due to its prominent spontaneous and piezoelectric polarization effects in GaN, AlN, InN, AlxInyGaN alloys and flexibility in inserting appropriate heterojunctions thus dramatically broaden the device design space.

由于击穿电场较大，如SiC，GaN，Ga2O3和金刚石基功率器件等宽禁带半导体是下一代功率开关应用的重点。通常采用面积比导通电阻与击穿电压之间的单极权衡关系来比较各种材料之间的性能限制。 GaN材料系统由于其在GaN，AlN，InN，AlxInyGaN合金中的突出的自发和压电极化效应而具有独特的优势，并且在插入适当的异质结中具有灵活性，因此极大地拓宽了器件设计空间。
