##### Abstract
In general, self help systems are being increasingly deployed by service based industries because they are capable of delivering better customer service and increasingly the switch is to voice based self help systems because they provide a natural interface for a human to interact with a machine. A speech based self help system ideally needs a speech recognition engine to convert spoken speech to text and in addition a language processing engine to take care of any misrecognitions by the speech recognition engine. Any off-the-shelf speech recognition engine is generally a combination of acoustic processing and speech grammar. While this is the norm, we believe that ideally a speech recognition application should have in addition to a speech recognition engine a separate language processing engine to give the system better performance. In this paper, we discuss ways in which the speech recognition engine and the language processing engine can be combined to give a better user experience.

##### Abstract (translated by Google)
一般来说，基于服务的行业越来越多地使用自助系统，因为它们能够提供更好的客户服务，越来越多地转向基于语音的自助系统，因为它们为人们提供了与机器交互的自然界面。基于语音的自助系统理想地需要语音识别引擎来将口头语音转换为文本，此外还需要语言处理引擎来处理语音识别引擎的任何误识别。任何现成的语音识别引擎通常是声学处理和语音语法的组合。虽然这是常态，但我们相信理想情况下，语音识别应用程序除了语音识别引擎之外，还应该有一个单独的语言处理引擎，以提高系统的性能。在本文中，我们讨论了语音识别引擎和语言处理引擎可以结合的方式，以提供更好的用户体验。
