##### Abstract
Knowledge of human presence and interaction in a vehicle is of growing interest to vehicle manufacturers for design and safety purposes. We present a framework to perform the tasks of occupant detection and occupant classification for automatic child locks and airbag suppression. It operates for all passenger seats, using a single overhead camera. A transfer learning technique is introduced to make full use of training data from all seats whilst still maintaining some control over the bias, necessary for a system designed to penalize certain misclassifications more than others. An evaluation is performed on a challenging dataset with both weighted and unweighted classifiers, demonstrating the effectiveness of the transfer process.

车辆制造商为了设计和安全目的对车辆中人员存在和交互的知识越来越感兴趣。我们提出了一个框架来执行自动儿童锁和安全气囊的乘员检测和乘员分类任务。它适用于所有乘客座位，使用一架头顶照相机。引入转移学习技术来充分利用所有席位的训练数据，同时仍然保持对偏差的一定控制，这对于旨在惩罚某些错误分类的系统是必要的。使用加权和非加权分类器对具有挑战性的数据集进行评估，证明转换过程的有效性。
