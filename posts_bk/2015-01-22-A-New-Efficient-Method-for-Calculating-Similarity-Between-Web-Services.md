##### Abstract
Web services allow communication between heterogeneous systems in a distributed environment. Their enormous success and their increased use led to the fact that thousands of Web services are present on the Internet. This significant number of Web services which not cease to increase has led to problems of the difficulty in locating and classifying web services, these problems are encountered mainly during the operations of web services discovery and substitution. Traditional ways of search based on keywords are not successful in this context, their results do not support the structure of Web services and they consider in their search only the identifiers of the web service description language (WSDL) interface elements. The methods based on semantics (WSDLS, OWLS, SAWSDL...) which increase the WSDL description of a Web service with a semantic description allow raising partially this problem, but their complexity and difficulty delays their adoption in real cases. Measuring the similarity between the web services interfaces is the most suitable solution for this kind of problems, it will classify available web services so as to know those that best match the searched profile and those that do not match. Thus, the main goal of this work is to study the degree of similarity between any two web services by offering a new method that is more effective than existing works.

Web服务允许在分布式环境中的异构系统之间进行通信。他们巨大的成功和更多的使用导致成千上万的Web服务出现在互联网上。这种不断增加的大量Web服务导致了Web服务定位和分类的困难，这些问题主要是在Web服务发现和替换的操作中遇到的。传统的基于关键字的搜索方式在这个上下文中是不成功的，他们的结果不支持Web服务的结构，他们在搜索时只考虑Web服务描述语言（WSDL）接口元素的标识符。基于语义的方法（WSDLS，OWLS，SAWSDL ...）通过语义描述来增加Web服务的WSDL描述允许部分地提高这个问题，但是它们的复杂性和难度在实际情况下延迟了它们的采用。衡量Web服务接口之间的相似性是解决这类问题的最合适的解决方案，它将对可用的Web服务进行分类，以便了解那些与搜索到的配置文件最匹配的配置，以及那些不匹配的配置。因此，这项工作的主要目标是通过提供一种比现有工作更有效的新方法来研究任何两个Web服务之间的相似程度。
