##### Abstract
Deep learning has gained much success in sentence-level relation classification. For example, convolutional neural networks (CNN) have delivered competitive performance without much effort on feature engineering as the conventional pattern-based methods. Thus a lot of works have been produced based on CNN structures. However, a key issue that has not been well addressed by the CNN-based method is the lack of capability to learn temporal features, especially long-distance dependency between nominal pairs. In this paper, we propose a simple framework based on recurrent neural networks (RNN) and compare it with CNN-based model. To show the limitation of popular used SemEval-2010 Task 8 dataset, we introduce another dataset refined from MIMLRE(Angeli et al., 2014). Experiments on two different datasets strongly indicates that the RNN-based model can deliver better performance on relation classification, and it is particularly capable of learning long-distance relation patterns. This makes it suitable for real-world applications where complicated expressions are often involved.

深度学习在句子级关系分类中取得了很大的成功。例如，卷积神经网络（CNN）已经在传统的基于模式的方法的功能工程方面作出了很大的贡献。因此，基于CNN结构已经产生了很多作品。然而，基于CNN的方法没有得到很好解决的一个关键问题是缺乏学习时态特征的能力，特别是名义对之间的长距离依赖性。在本文中，我们提出了一个基于递归神经网络（RNN）的简单框架，并将其与基于CNN的模型进行比较。为了显示常用的SemEval-2010任务8数据集的局限性，我们介绍了MIMLRE（Angeli等，2014）提炼的另一个数据集。对两个不同数据集的实验表明，基于RNN的模型能够在关系分类上提供更好的性能，尤其能够学习远程关系模式。这使得它适用于经常涉及复杂表达式的实际应用。
