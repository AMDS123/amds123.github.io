##### Abstract
Document image has been the area of research for a couple of decades because of its potential application in the area of text recognition, line recognition or any other shape recognition from the image. For most of these purposes binarization of image becomes mandatory as far as recognition is concerned. Throughout couple decades standard algorithms have already been developed for this purpose. Some of these algorithms are applicable to degraded image also. Our objective behind this work is to study the existing techniques, compare them in view of advantages and disadvantages and modify some of these algorithms to optimize time or performance.

由于文字图像在文字识别，线条识别或任何其他形状识别领域的潜在应用，文档图像已经是几十年来的研究领域。对于大多数这些目的来说，就识别而言，图像的二值化是强制性的。在几十年的时间里，为此已经开发了标准算法。其中一些算法也适用于降级图像。我们在这项工作背后的目标是研究现有的技术，比较它们的优点和缺点，并修改其中的一些算法来优化时间或性能。
