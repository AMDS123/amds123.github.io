##### Abstract
This paper presents a novel multi scale gradient and a corner point based shape descriptors. The novel multi scale gradient based shape descriptor is combined with generic Fourier descriptors to extract contour and region based shape information. Shape information based object class detection and classification technique with a random forest classifier has been optimized. Proposed integrated descriptor in this paper is robust to rotation, scale, translation, affine deformations, noisy contours and noisy shapes. The new corner point based interpolated shape descriptor has been exploited for fast object detection and classification with higher accuracy.

本文提出了一种新颖的多尺度梯度和基于角点的形状描述子。基于多尺度梯度的新颖形状描述符与通用傅立叶描述符相结合，提取轮廓和区域形状信息。对基于形状信息的随机森林分类器对象类别检测和分类技术进行了优化。本文提出的集成描述符对旋转，尺度，平移，仿射变形，噪声轮廓和噪声形状都是鲁棒的。基于新的基于角点的插值形状描述符已被用于更高精度的快速目标检测和分类。
