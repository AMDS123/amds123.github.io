##### Abstract
Face Recognition has been studied for many decades. As opposed to traditional hand-crafted features such as LBP and HOG, much more sophisticated features can be learned automatically by deep learning methods in a data-driven way. In this paper, we propose a two-stage approach that combines a multi-patch deep CNN and deep metric learning, which extracts low dimensional but very discriminative features for face verification and recognition. Experiments show that this method outperforms other state-of-the-art methods on LFW dataset, achieving 99.77% pair-wise verification accuracy and significantly better accuracy under other two more practical protocols. This paper also discusses the importance of data size and the number of patches, showing a clear path to practical high-performance face recognition systems in real world.

人脸识别已经研究了几十年。与传统的手工功能（如LBP和HOG）相反，深度学习方法可以通过数据驱动的方式自动学习更复杂的功能。在本文中，我们提出了一个两阶段的方法，结合了多贴片深度CNN和深度量学习，提取低维但非常区分的特征进行人脸验证和识别。实验表明，该方法在LFW数据集上的性能优于其他现有的方法，在其他两种更实用的协议下，达到了99.77％的成对验证精度，并且精度明显提高。本文还讨论了数据大小和补丁数量的重要性，为实际的高性能人脸识别系统提供了一条清晰的路径。
