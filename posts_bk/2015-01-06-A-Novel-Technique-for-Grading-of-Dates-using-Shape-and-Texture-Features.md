##### Abstract
This paper presents a novel method to grade the date fruits based on the combination of shape and texture features. The method begins with reducing the specular reflection and small noise using a bilateral filter. Threshold based segmentation is performed for background removal and fruit part selection from the given image. Shape features is extracted using the contour of the date fruit and texture features are extracted using Curvelet transform and Local Binary Pattern (LBP) from the selected date fruit region. Finally, combinations of shape and texture features are fused to grade the dates into six grades. k-Nearest Neighbour(k-NN) classifier yields the best grading rate compared to other two classifiers such as Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Linear Discriminant(LDA) classifiers. The experiment result shows that our technique achieves highest accuracy.

本文提出了一种基于形状和纹理特征相结合的日期水果评分方法。该方法从使用双边滤波器减少镜面反射和小噪声开始。基于阈值的分割被执行用于从给定图像的背景去除和水果部分选择。使用日期水果的轮廓提取形状特征，并且使用来自所选日期果实区域的Curvelet变换和局部二值模式（LBP）提取纹理特征。最后，形状和纹理特征的组合被融合以将日期分为六个等级。与支持向量机（SVM）和线性判别分类器（LDA）等其他两个分类器相比，k-最近邻（k-NN）分类器可产生最佳分级率。实验结果表明，我们的技术达到了最高的准确性。
