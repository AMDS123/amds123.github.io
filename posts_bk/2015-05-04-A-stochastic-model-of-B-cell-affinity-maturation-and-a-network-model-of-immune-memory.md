##### Abstract
Many events in the vertebrate immune system are influenced by some element of chance. The objective of the present work is to describe affinity maturation of B lymphocytes (in which random events are perhaps the most characteristic), and to study a possible network model of immune memory. In our model stochastic processes govern all events. A major novelty of this approach is that it permits studying random variations in the immune process. Four basic components are simulated in the model: non-immune self cells, nonself cells (pathogens), B lymphocytes, and bone marrow cells that produce naive B lymphocytes. A point in a generalized shape space plus the size of the corresponding population represents nonself and non-immune self cells. On the other hand, each individual B cell is represented by a disc that models its recognition region in the shape space. Infection is simulated by an "injection" of nonself cells into the system. Division of pathogens may instigate an attack of naive B cells, which in turn may induce clonal proliferation and hypermutation in the attacking B cells, and which eventually may slow down and stop the exponential growth of pathogens. Affinity maturation of newly produced B cells becomes expressed as a result of selection when the number of pathogens decreases. Under favorable conditions, the expanded primary B cell clones may stimulate the expansion of secondary B cell clones carrying complementary receptors to the stimulating B cells. Like in a hall of mirrors, the image of pathogens in the primary B cell clones then will be reflected in secondary B cell clones. This "ping-pong" game may survive for a long time even in the absence of the pathogen, creating a local network memory. This memory ensures that repeated infection by the same pathogen will be eliminated more efficiently.

脊椎动物免疫系统中的许多事件都受到偶然因素的影响。目前工作的目的是描述B淋巴细胞的亲和力成熟（其中随机事件可能是最具特色的），并研究可能的免疫记忆网络模型。在我们的模型中，随机过程管理所有事件。这种方法的一个主要新颖之处在于它允许研究免疫过程中的随机变异。在模型中模拟了四种基本组分：非免疫自体细胞，非自体细胞（病原体），B淋巴细胞和产生幼稚B淋巴细胞的骨髓细胞。广义形状空间加上相应人口的大小表示非自身和非免疫自体细胞。另一方面，每个单独的B单元由在形状空间中对其识别区域建模的盘表示。感染是通过将非自身细胞“注入”系统来模拟的。病原体的分裂可能会引发幼稚B细胞的攻击，进而可能诱发攻击B细胞的克隆增殖和高变，最终可能减缓并阻止病原体的指数生长。当病原体的数量减少时，新产生的B细胞的亲和力成熟表现为选择的结果。在有利条件下，扩增的原代B细胞克隆可以刺激带有互补受体的辅助B细胞克隆扩增至刺激B细胞。就像在一个镜子的大厅里一样，原始B细胞克隆中的病原体的图像将反映在继发性B细胞克隆中。即使在没有病原体的情况下，这种“乒乓球”游戏也可能存活很长时间，从而形成本地网络记忆。这种记忆确保了同一病原体的反复感染将被更有效地消除。
