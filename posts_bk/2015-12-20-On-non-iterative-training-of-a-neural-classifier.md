##### Abstract
Recently an algorithm, was discovered, which separates points in n-dimension by planes in such a manner that no two points are left un-separated by at least one plane{[}1-3{]}. By using this new algorithm we show that there are two ways of classification by a neural network, for a large dimension feature space, both of which are non-iterative and deterministic. To demonstrate the power of both these methods we apply them exhaustively to the classical pattern recognition problem: The Fisher-Anderson's, IRIS flower data set and present the results. It is expected these methods will now be widely used for the training of neural networks for Deep Learning not only because of their non-iterative and deterministic nature but also because of their efficiency and speed and will supersede other classification methods which are iterative in nature and rely on error minimization.

最近发现了一种算法，该算法以平面方式将n维点分离，使得至少有一个平面{[} 1-3 {]}没有任何两个点之间没有分离。通过使用这种新算法，我们可以看出，对于一个大维度的特征空间来说，神经网络有两种分类方式，它们都是非迭代的和确定性的。为了证明这两种方法的力量，我们将其详尽地应用于经典的模式识别问题：Fisher-Anderson的IRIS花数据集并呈现结果。预计这些方法现在将被广泛用于深度学习的神经网络的训练，不仅因为它们的非迭代和确定性质，而且因为它们的效率和速度，并且将取代其他本质上迭代的分类方法，依靠错误最小化。
