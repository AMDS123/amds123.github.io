##### Abstract
In this paper, we focus on how to locate the relevant or discriminative brain regions related with external stimulus or certain mental decease, which is also called support identification, based on the neuroimaging data. The main difficulty lies in the extremely high dimensional voxel space and relatively few training samples, easily resulting in an unstable brain region discovery (or called feature selection in context of pattern recognition). When the training samples are from different centers and have betweencenter variations, it will be even harder to obtain a reliable and consistent result. Corresponding, we revisit our recently proposed algorithm based on stability selection and structural sparsity. It is applied to the multi-center MRI data analysis for the first time. A consistent and stable result is achieved across different centers despite the between-center data variation while many other state-of-the-art methods such as two sample t-test fail. Moreover, we have empirically showed that the performance of this algorithm is robust and insensitive to several of its key parameters. In addition, the support identification results on both functional MRI and structural MRI are interpretable and can be the potential biomarkers.

在本文中，我们将重点放在如何根据神经影像数据来定位与外部刺激或某些精神病相关的有关或有区别的大脑区域（也称为支持识别）。主要困难在于极高维体素空间和相对较少的训练样本，容易导致大脑区域发现不稳定（或称为模式识别环境下的特征选择）。当训练样本来自不同的中心并且具有不同的中心变化时，将更难获得可靠和一致的结果。相应地，我们重新审视了我们最近提出的基于稳定性选择和结构稀疏性的算法。它首次应用于多中心MRI数据分析。尽管存在中心间数据差异，但是在许多其他最先进的方法如两个样本t检验失败的情况下，跨不同中心实现了一致且稳定的结果。此外，我们已经经验地表明，这个算法的性能是健壮的，对其几个关键参数不敏感。另外，功能MRI和结构MRI上的支持鉴定结果是可解释的，并且可以是潜在的生物标志物。
