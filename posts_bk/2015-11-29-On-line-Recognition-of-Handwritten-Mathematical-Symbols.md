##### Abstract
Finding the name of an unknown symbol is often hard, but writing the symbol is easy. This bachelor's thesis presents multiple systems that use the pen trajectory to classify handwritten symbols. Five preprocessing steps, one data augmentation algorithm, five features and five variants for multilayer Perceptron training were evaluated using 166898 recordings which were collected with two crowdsourcing projects. The evaluation results of these 21 experiments were used to create an optimized recognizer which has a TOP1 error of less than 17.5% and a TOP3 error of 4.0%. This is an improvement of 18.5% for the TOP1 error and 29.7% for the TOP3 error.

找到一个未知符号的名字通常很难，但是写下这个符号很容易。这个学士论文提出了多个使用笔轨迹来分类手写符号的系统。用两个众包项目收集的166898条记录对五个预处理步骤，一个数据增强算法，五个特征和五个变体进行了多层感知器训练评估。使用这21个实验的评估结果来创建具有小于17.5％的TOP1误差和4.0％的TOP3误差的优化的识别器。 TOP1错误率为18.5％，TOP3错误率为29.7％。
