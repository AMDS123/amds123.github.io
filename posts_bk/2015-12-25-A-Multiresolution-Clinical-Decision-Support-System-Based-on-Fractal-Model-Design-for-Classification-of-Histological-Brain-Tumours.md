##### Abstract
Tissue texture is known to exhibit a heterogeneous or non-stationary nature, therefore using a single resolution approach for optimum classification might not suffice. A clinical decision support system that exploits the subband textural fractal characteristics for best bases selection of meningioma brain histopathological image classification is proposed. Each subband is analysed using its fractal dimension instead of energy, which has the advantage of being less sensitive to image intensity and abrupt changes in tissue texture. The most significant subband that best identifies texture discontinuities will be chosen for further decomposition, and its fractal characteristics would represent the optimal feature vector for classification. The performance was tested using the support vector machine (SVM), Bayesian and k-nearest neighbour (kNN) classifiers and a leave-one-patient-out method was employed for validation. Our method outperformed the classical energy based selection approaches, achieving for SVM, Bayesian and kNN classifiers an overall classification accuracy of 94.12%, 92.50% and 79.70%, as compared to 86.31%, 83.19% and 51.63% for the co-occurrence matrix, and 76.01%, 73.50% and 50.69% for the energy texture signatures, respectively. These results indicate the potential usefulness as a decision support system that could complement radiologists diagnostic capability to discriminate higher order statistical textural information, for which it would be otherwise difficult via ordinary human vision.

已知组织结构表现出非均匀或非平稳性质，因此使用单一分辨率方法进行最佳分类可能是不够的。提出了利用子带纹理分形特征进行脑膜瘤脑组织病理学图像分类的最佳基础选择的临床决策支持系统。使用分形维而不是能量分析每个子带，其具有对图像强度较不敏感以及组织纹理突然变化的优点。最好的识别纹理不连续性的最重要的子带将被选择用于进一步分解，并且其分形特征将表示用于分类的最优特征向量。使用支持向量机（SVM），贝叶斯（Bayesian）和k-最近邻（kNN）分类器对性能进行测试，并且采用“一病人离开（leave-one-patient-out）”方法进行验证。我们的方法优于传统的基于能量的选择方法，对于共生矩阵，SVM，贝叶斯和kNN分类器的总体分类准确率分别为94.12％，92.50％和79.70％，分别为86.31％，83.19％和51.63％能量纹理特征分别为76.01％，73.50％和50.69％。这些结果表明作为一个决策支持系统的潜在用处，它可以补充放射科医师的诊断能力，以区分更高阶的统计纹理信息，否则通过普通的人类视觉将难以实现。
