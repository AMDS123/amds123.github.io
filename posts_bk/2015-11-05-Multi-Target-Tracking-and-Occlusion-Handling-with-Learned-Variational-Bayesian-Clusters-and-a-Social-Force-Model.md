##### Abstract
This paper considers the problem of multiple human target tracking in a sequence of video data. A solution is proposed which is able to deal with the challenges of a varying number of targets, interactions and when every target gives rise to multiple measurements. The developed novel algorithm comprises variational Bayesian clustering combined with a social force model, integrated within a particle filter with an enhanced prediction step. It performs measurement-to-target association by automatically detecting the measurement relevance. The performance of the developed algorithm is evaluated over several sequences from publicly available data sets: AV16.3, CAVIAR and PETS2006, which demonstrates that the proposed algorithm successfully initializes and tracks a variable number of targets in the presence of complex occlusions. A comparison with state-of-the-art techniques due to Khan et al., Laet et al. and Czyz et al. shows improved tracking performance.

本文考虑了一系列视频数据中的多人目标跟踪问题。提出了一种解决方案，能够应对不同数量的目标，相互作用以及每个目标何时产生多个测量的挑战。所开发的新型算法包括结合社会力量模型的变分贝叶斯聚类，其被集成在具有增强的预测步骤的粒子滤波器内。它通过自动检测测量相关性来执行测量到目标的关联。所开发的算法的性能在来自公开可用数据集AV16.3，CAVIAR和PETS2006的几个序列上进行评估，其证明了所提出的算法在复杂遮挡情况下成功地初始化和跟踪可变数目的目标。与Khan等人，Laet等人的最先进技术的比较和Czyz等人显示改进的跟踪性能。
