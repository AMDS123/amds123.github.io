##### Abstract
Recent years have witnessed the increase of competition in science. While promoting the quality of research in many cases, an intense competition among scientists can also trigger unethical scientific behaviors. To increase the total number of published papers, some authors even resort to software tools that are able to produce grammatical, but meaningless scientific manuscripts. Because automatically generated papers can be misunderstood as real papers, it becomes of paramount importance to develop means to identify these scientific frauds. In this paper, I devise a methodology to distinguish real manuscripts from those generated with SCIGen, an automatic paper generator. Upon modeling texts as complex networks (CN), it was possible to discriminate real from fake papers with at least 89\% of accuracy. A systematic analysis of features relevance revealed that the accessibility and betweenness were useful in particular cases, even though the relevance depended upon the dataset. The successful application of the methods described here show, as a proof of principle, that network features can be used to identify scientific gibberish papers. In addition, the CN-based approach can be combined in a straightforward fashion with traditional statistical language processing methods to improve the performance in identifying artificially generated papers.

近年来，科学竞争日益激烈。在许多情况下，在提高研究质量的同时，科学家之间激烈的竞争也会引发不道德的科学行为。为了增加发表论文的总数，一些作者甚至求助于能够产生语法但没有意义的科学手稿的软件工具。由于自动生成的论文可能会被误解为真实的论文，因此开发识别这些科学欺诈的手段变得极其重要。在本文中，我设计了一种方法来区分真正的手稿与自动造纸机SCIGen生成的手稿。在将文本建模为复杂网络（CN）时，有可能以至少89％的准确度区分真伪。功能相关性的系统分析表明，即使相关性依赖于数据集，可访问性和中介性在特定情况下也是有用的。这里描述的方法的成功应用表明，作为一个原则的证明，网络特征可以用来识别科学乱码文件。另外，基于CN的方法可以与传统的统计语言处理方法直接结合，提高识别人工生成的论文的性能。
