##### Abstract
Modern machine learning-based recognition approaches require large-scale datasets with large number of labelled training images. However, such datasets are inherently difficult and costly to collect and annotate. Hence there is a great and growing interest in automatic dataset collection methods that can leverage the web. % which are collected % in a cheap, efficient and yet unreliable way. Collecting datasets in this way, however, requires robust and efficient ways for detecting and excluding outliers that are common and prevalent. % Outliers are thus a % prominent treat of using these dataset. So far, there have been a limited effort in machine learning community to directly detect outliers for robust classification. Inspired by the recent work on Pre-conditioned LASSO, this paper formulates the outlier detection task using Pre-conditioned LASSO and employs \red{unsupervised} transductive diffusion component analysis to both integrate the topological structure of the data manifold, from labeled and unlabeled instances, and reduce the feature dimensionality. Synthetic experiments as well as results on two real-world classification tasks show that our framework can robustly detect the outliers and improve classification.

现代基于机器学习的识别方法需要具有大量标记的训练图像的大规模数据集。然而，这样的数据集本质上难以收集和注释成本高昂。因此，对可以利用网络的自动数据集收集方法有着越来越大的兴趣。 ％是以廉价，高效，但不可靠的方式收集的。然而，以这种方式收集数据集需要稳健而有效的方法来检测和排除常见和普遍的异常值。因此，离群值是使用这些数据集的一个显着特点。到目前为止，机器学习社区直接检测异常值进行鲁棒分类的努力有限。受到预处理LASSO近期工作的启发，本文利用预条件LASSO制定异常值检测任务，并采用\ red {无监督}传导扩散分量分析方法，将已标记和未标记实例的数据流形的拓扑结构，并减少特征的维度。合成实验以及两个真实世界分类任务的结果表明，我们的框架可以鲁棒地检测异常值并改善分类。
