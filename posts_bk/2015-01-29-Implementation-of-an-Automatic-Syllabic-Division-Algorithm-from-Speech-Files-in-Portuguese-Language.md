##### Abstract
A new algorithm for voice automatic syllabic splitting in the Portuguese language is proposed, which is based on the envelope of the speech signal of the input audio file. A computational implementation in MatlabTM is presented and made available at the URL this http URL Due to its straightforwardness, the proposed method is very attractive for embedded systems (e.g. i-phones). It can also be used as a screen to assist more sophisticated methods. Voice excerpts containing more than one syllable and identified by the same envelope are named as super-syllables and they are subsequently separated. The results indicate which samples corresponds to the beginning and end of each detected syllable. Preliminary tests were performed to fifty words at an identification rate circa 70% (further improvements may be incorporated to treat particular phonemes). This algorithm is also useful in voice command systems, as a tool in the teaching of Portuguese language or even for patients with speech pathology.

提出了一种基于输入音频文件的语音信号包络的葡萄牙语语音自动分音的新算法。在MatlabTM中的一个计算实现被提出并且可以在URL这个http URL处得到。由于其简单直观，所提出的方法对于嵌入式系统（例如，i-phone）是非常有吸引力的。它也可以用作屏幕来辅助更复杂的方法。包含多个音节并由相同信封标识的语音片段被命名为超级音节，并且随后被分离。结果表明哪些样本对应于每个检测到的音节的开始和结束。以50％左右的识别率对50个字进行初步测试（对于特定的音素可以进一步改进）。这种算法在语音命令系统中也是有用的，作为葡萄牙语教学的工具甚至语言病理学的学习者。
