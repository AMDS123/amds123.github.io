##### Abstract
A popular approach to sentence compression is to formulate the task as a constrained optimization problem and solve it with integer linear programming (ILP) tools. Unfortunately, dependence on ILP may make the compressor prohibitively slow, and thus approximation techniques have been proposed which are often complex and offer a moderate gain in speed. As an alternative solution, we introduce a novel compression algorithm which generates k-best compressions relying on local deletion decisions. Our algorithm is two orders of magnitude faster than a recent ILP-based method while producing better compressions. Moreover, an extensive evaluation demonstrates that the quality of compressions does not degrade much as we move from single best to top-five results.

一个流行的句子压缩方法是把这个任务作为一个约束优化问题来解决，并用整数线性规划（ILP）工具来解决它。不幸的是，对ILP的依赖可能会使压缩机过于缓慢，因此已经提出了通常很复杂并且速度适中的近似技术。作为一种替代解决方案，我们引入了一种新颖的压缩算法，它依赖于局部的删除决定产生k-最佳压缩。我们的算法比最近的基于ILP的方法快两个数量级，同时产生更好的压缩。而且，广泛的评估表明，随着我们从单一的最好的结果转向最高的五个结果，压缩质量并没有太大的降低。
