##### Abstract
Counting the number of people is something many security application focus on, when dealing with controlling accesses in restricted areas, as it occurs with banks, airports, railway stations and governmental offices. This paper presents an automated solution for detecting the presence of more than one person into interlocked doors adopted in many accesses. In most cases, interlocked doors are small areas where other pieces of information and sensors are placed in order to detect the presence of guns, explosive, etc. The general goals and the required environmental condition, allowed us to implement a detection system at lower costs and complexity, with respect to other existing techniques. The system consists of a fixed array of microwave transceiver modules, whose received signals are processed to collect information related to a sort of volume occupied in the interlocked door cabin. The proposed solution has been statistically validated by using statistical analysis. The whole solution has been also implemented to be used in a real time environment and thus validated against real experimental measures.

计算人数是许多安全应用程序关注的问题，在处理限制区域的访问时，就像银行，机场，火车站和政府办公室那样。本文提出了一种自动化解决方案，用于检测多人进入互锁门的情况。在大多数情况下，联锁门是放置其他信息和传感器的小区域，以检测枪支，爆炸物等的存在。总体目标和所需的环境条件允许我们以较低成本实施检测系统和其他现有技术的复杂性。该系统由固定阵列的微波收发器模块构成，其接收信号被处理以收集与在联锁门舱中占用的一种量有关的信息。所提出的解决方案已通过统计分析进行了统计验证。整个解决方案也被实现在实时环境中使用，从而验证了实际的实验措施。
