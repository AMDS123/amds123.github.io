##### Abstract
Research into statistical parsing for English has enjoyed over a decade of successful results. However, adapting these models to other languages has met with difficulties. Previous comparative work has shown that Modern Arabic is one of the most difficult languages to parse due to rich morphology and free word order. Classical Arabic is the ancient form of Arabic, and is understudied in computational linguistics, relative to its worldwide reach as the language of the Quran. The thesis is based on seven publications that make significant contributions to knowledge relating to annotating and parsing Classical Arabic. A central argument of this thesis is that using a hybrid representation closely aligned to traditional grammar leads to improved parsing for Arabic. To test this hypothesis, two approaches are compared. As a reference, a pure dependency parser is adapted using graph transformations, resulting in an 87.47% F1-score. This is compared to an integrated parsing model with an F1-score of 89.03%, demonstrating that joint dependency-constituency parsing is better suited to Classical Arabic.

英语统计分析研究已经有十多年的成功经验。但是，将这些模式适用于其他语言遇到困难。先前的比较工作表明，现代阿拉伯语是由于丰富的形态和自由的语序而解析的最困难的语言之一。古典阿拉伯语是古代阿拉伯语的形式，并且在计算语言学方面被忽视，相对于其作为古兰经语言的全球范围而言。本论文是基于七个出版物，对古典阿拉伯语注释和解析的知识作出重大贡献。本论文的核心论点是，使用与传统语法紧密结合的混合表示方法可以改进阿拉伯语的解析。为了检验这个假设，比较了两种方法。作为参考，使用图形变换来调整纯粹的依赖关系解析器，导致87.47％的F1分数。这与F1分数为89.03％的综合分析模型进行了比较，表明联合依赖 - 选区分析更适合古典阿拉伯语。
