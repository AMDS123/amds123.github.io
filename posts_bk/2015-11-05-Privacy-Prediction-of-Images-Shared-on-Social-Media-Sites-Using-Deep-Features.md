##### Abstract
Online image sharing in social media sites such as Facebook, Flickr, and Instagram can lead to unwanted disclosure and privacy violations, when privacy settings are used inappropriately. With the exponential increase in the number of images that are shared online every day, the development of effective and efficient prediction methods for image privacy settings are highly needed. The performance of models critically depends on the choice of the feature representation. In this paper, we present an approach to image privacy prediction that uses deep features and deep image tags as feature representations. Specifically, we explore deep features at various neural network layers and use the top layer (probability) as an auto-annotation mechanism. The results of our experiments show that models trained on the proposed deep features and deep image tags substantially outperform baselines such as those based on SIFT and GIST as well as those that use "bag of tags" as features.

在Facebook，Flickr和Instagram等社交媒体网站上进行在线图片分享可能会导致不必要的泄露和隐私侵犯，因为隐私设置的使用不当。随着每天在线共享图像数量的指数增长，非常需要开发有效和高效的图像隐私设置预测方法。模型的性能主要取决于特征表示的选择。在本文中，我们提出了一种使用深度特征和深度图像标签作为特征表示的图像隐私预测方法。具体而言，我们探索各种神经网络层的深层特征，并使用顶层（概率）作为自动注释机制。我们的实验结果表明，对所提出的深度特征和深度图像标签进行训练的模型基本上胜过基于SIFT和GIST的基线以及那些使用“标签包”作为特征的基线。
