##### Abstract
In the artificial intelligence area, one of the ultimate goals is to make computers understand human language and offer assistance. In order to achieve this ideal, researchers of computer science have put forward a lot of models and algorithms attempting at enabling the machine to analyze and process human natural language on different levels of semantics. Although recent progress in this field offers much hope, we still have to ask whether current research can provide assistance that people really desire in reading and comprehension. To this end, we conducted a reading comprehension test on two scientific papers which are written in different styles. We use the semantic link models to analyze the understanding obstacles that people will face in the process of reading and figure out what makes it difficult for human to understand a scientific literature. Through such analysis, we summarized some characteristics and problems which are reflected by people with different levels of knowledge on the comprehension of difficult science and technology literature, which can be modeled in semantic link network. We believe that these characteristics and problems will help us re-examine the existing machine models and are helpful in the designing of new one.

##### Abstract (translated by Google)
在人工智能领域，最终的目标之一是让电脑了解人类的语言并提供帮助。为了达到这个理想，计算机科学的研究人员提出了很多模型和算法，试图使机器能够在不同的语义层次上分析和处理人类的自然语言。虽然近来在这方面的进展提供了很大的希望，但我们仍然不得不问，目前的研究能否提供人们真正渴望阅读和理解的帮助。为此，我们对两篇不同风格的科技论文进行了阅读理解测试。我们利用语义链接模型分析人们在阅读过程中会遇到的理解障碍，找出使人们难以理解科学文献的原因。通过这样的分析，总结出了一些可以在语义链接网络中建模的，对于难度较大的科技文献理解水平不同的人所反映的一些特点和问题。我们相信这些特点和问题将帮助我们重新审视现有的机器模型，并有助于新机器的设计。
