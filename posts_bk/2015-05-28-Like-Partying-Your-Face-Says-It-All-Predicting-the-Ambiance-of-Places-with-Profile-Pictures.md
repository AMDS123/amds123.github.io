##### Abstract
To choose restaurants and coffee shops, people are increasingly relying on social-networking sites. In a popular site such as Foursquare or Yelp, a place comes with descriptions and reviews, and with profile pictures of people who frequent them. Descriptions and reviews have been widely explored in the research area of data mining. By contrast, profile pictures have received little attention. Previous work showed that people are able to partly guess a place's ambiance, clientele, and activities not only by observing the place itself but also by observing the profile pictures of its visitors. Here we further that work by determining which visual cues people may have relied upon to make their guesses; showing that a state-of-the-art algorithm could make predictions more accurately than humans at times; and demonstrating that the visual cues people relied upon partly differ from those of the algorithm.

要选择餐馆和咖啡店，人们越来越依赖于社交网站。在Foursquare或Yelp这样的热门网站上，有一个地方会有描述和评论，还有频繁出现的人的个人资料照片。数据挖掘的研究领域已经广泛地探讨了描述和评论。相比之下，个人资料照片很少受到关注。以前的工作表明，人们不仅可以通过观察场所本身，也可以通过观察观众的个人形象来部分地猜测一个地方的气氛，客户和活动。在这里，我们通过确定人们可能依赖的视觉线索来进行猜测。表明一种最先进的算法能够比人类更准确地进行预测;并且证明了人们所依赖的视觉线索与算法的部分不同。
