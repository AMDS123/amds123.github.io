##### Abstract
Machine translation is evolving quite rapidly in terms of quality. Nowadays, we have several machine translation systems available in the web, which provide reasonable translations. However, these systems are not perfect, and their quality may decrease in some specific domains. This paper examines the effects of different training methods when it comes to Polish - English Statistical Machine Translation system used for the medical data. Numerous elements of the EMEA parallel text corpora and not related OPUS Open Subtitles project were used as the ground for creation of phrase tables and different language models including the development, tuning and testing of these translation systems. The BLEU, NIST, METEOR, and TER metrics have been used in order to evaluate the results of various systems. Our experiments deal with the systems that include POS tagging, factored phrase models, hierarchical models, syntactic taggers, and other alignment methods. We also executed a deep analysis of Polish data as preparatory work before automatized data processing such as true casing or punctuation normalization phase. Normalized metrics was used to compare results. Scores lower than 15% mean that Machine Translation engine is unable to provide satisfying quality, scores greater than 30% mean that translations should be understandable without problems and scores over 50 reflect adequate translations. The average results of Polish to English translations scores for BLEU, NIST, METEOR, and TER were relatively high and ranged from 70,58 to 82,72. The lowest score was 64,38. The average results ranges for English to Polish translations were little lower (67,58 - 78,97). The real-life implementations of presented high quality Machine Translation Systems are anticipated in general medical practice and telemedicine.

机器翻译在质量方面正在迅速发展。现在，我们在网上有几个机器翻译系统，提供合理的翻译。但是，这些制度并不完善，在某些特定的领域，质量可能会下降。本文考察了用于医疗数据的波兰英语统计机器翻译系统中不同训练方法的效果。 EMEA平行文本语料库和不相关的OPUS开放字幕项目中的许多元素被用作创建词组表和不同语言模型的基础，包括这些翻译系统的开发，调整和测试。已经使用了BLEU，NIST，METEOR和TER度量来评估各种系统的结果。我们的实验涉及包括POS标记，因式分解短语模型，分层模型，句法标记器和其他对齐方法的系统。我们还对波兰数据进行了深入的分析，作为自动化数据处理之前的准备工作，如真正的套管或标点归一化阶段。使用标准化度量来比较结果。分数低于15％意味着机器翻译引擎无法提供令人满意的质量，分数大于30％意味着翻译应该可以理解而没有问题，分数超过50则反映了足够的翻译。 BLEU，NIST，METEOR和TER的波兰语到英语翻译得分的平均结果相对较高，范围从70,58到82,72。最低分是64,38。英语译成波兰语的平均结果范围稍低（67,58  -  78,97）。预计高质量机器翻译系统的实际应用将在一般医疗实践和远程医疗领域得到应用。
