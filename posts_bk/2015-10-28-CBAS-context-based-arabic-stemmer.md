##### Abstract
Arabic morphology encapsulates many valuable features such as word root. Arabic roots are being utilized for many tasks; the process of extracting a word root is referred to as stemming. Stemming is an essential part of most Natural Language Processing tasks, especially for derivative languages such as Arabic. However, stemming is faced with the problem of ambiguity, where two or more roots could be extracted from the same word. On the other hand, distributional semantics is a powerful co-occurrence model. It captures the meaning of a word based on its context. In this paper, a distributional semantics model utilizing Smoothed Pointwise Mutual Information (SPMI) is constructed to investigate its effectiveness on the stemming analysis task. It showed an accuracy of 81.5%, with a at least 9.4% improvement over other stemmers.

##### Abstract (translated by Google)
阿拉伯语形态包含许多有价值的特征，如词根。阿拉伯的根源正被用于许多任务;提取词根的过程称为词干。词干是大多数自然语言处理任务的重要组成部分，尤其是对于衍生语言，如阿拉伯语。然而，词干却面临着模糊的问题，即可以从同一个词中提取两个或两个以上的词根。另一方面，分布式语义是一个强大的共现模型。它根据上下文捕捉单词的含义。在本文中，构建了一个利用平滑点信息（SPMI）的分布语义模型来研究它在词干分析任务上的有效性。它显示了81.5％的准确性，至少比其他词干提高了9.4％。
