##### Abstract
Automated scene analysis has been a topic of great interest in computer vision and cognitive science. Recently, with the growth of crowd phenomena in the real world, crowded scene analysis has attracted much attention. However, the visual occlusions and ambiguities in crowded scenes, as well as the complex behaviors and scene semantics, make the analysis a challenging task. In the past few years, an increasing number of works on crowded scene analysis have been reported, covering different aspects including crowd motion pattern learning, crowd behavior and activity analysis, and anomaly detection in crowds. This paper surveys the state-of-the-art techniques on this topic. We first provide the background knowledge and the available features related to crowded scenes. Then, existing models, popular algorithms, evaluation protocols, as well as system performance are provided corresponding to different aspects of crowded scene analysis. We also outline the available datasets for performance evaluation. Finally, some research problems and promising future directions are presented with discussions.

自动化场景分析一直是计算机视觉和认知科学领域的热门话题。最近，随着现实世界中人群现象的增多，拥挤的场景分析备受关注。然而，拥挤场景中的视觉遮挡和模糊，以及复杂的行为和场景语义，使分析成为一项具有挑战性的任务。在过去的几年里，越来越多的关于拥挤场景分析的作品被报道，包括人群运动模式学习，人群行为和活动分析，人群异常检测等方面。本文调查了这个主题的最新技术。我们首先提供与拥挤场景相关的背景知识和可用特征。然后，针对拥挤场景分析的不同方面，提供现有的模型，流行算法，评估协议以及系统性能。我们还概述了可用的性能评估数据集。最后，讨论了一些研究问题和有希望的未来方向。
