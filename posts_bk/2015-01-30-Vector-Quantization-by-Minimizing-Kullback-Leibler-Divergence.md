##### Abstract
This paper proposes a new method for vector quantization by minimizing the Kullback-Leibler Divergence between the class label distributions over the quantization inputs, which are original vectors, and the output, which is the quantization subsets of the vector set. In this way, the vector quantization output can keep as much information of the class label as possible. An objective function is constructed and we also developed an iterative algorithm to minimize it. The new method is evaluated on bag-of-features based image classification problem.

本文提出了一种新的矢量量化方法，通过最小化作为原始矢量的量化输入上的类别标签分布与作为矢量集合的量化子集的输出之间的Kullback-Leibler散度。这样，矢量量化输出可以尽可能多地保持类别标签的信息。构造一个目标函数，我们也开发了一个迭代算法来最小化它。基于特征袋的图像分类问题评估新方法。
