##### Abstract
In this paper, the problem of de-noising of an image contaminated with Additive White Gaussian Noise (AWGN) is studied. This subject is an open problem in signal processing for more than 50 years. Local methods suggested in recent years, have obtained better results than global methods. However by more intelligent training in such a way that first, important data is more effective for training, second, clustering in such way that training blocks lie in low-rank subspaces, we can design a dictionary applicable for image de-noising and obtain results near the state of the art local methods. In the present paper, we suggest a method based on global clustering of image constructing blocks. As the type of clustering plays an important role in clustering-based de-noising methods, we address two questions about the clustering. The first, which parts of the data should be considered for clustering? and the second, what data clustering method is suitable for de-noising.? Then clustering is exploited to learn an over complete dictionary. By obtaining sparse decomposition of the noisy image blocks in terms of the dictionary atoms, the de-noised version is achieved. In addition to our framework, 7 popular dictionary learning methods are simulated and compared. The results are compared based on two major factors: (1) de-noising performance and (2) execution time. Experimental results show that our dictionary learning framework outperforms its competitors in terms of both factors.

本文研究了加性高斯白噪声（AWGN）对图像去噪的问题。这个问题在信号处理方面已经有50多年的历史了。近年来提出的本地方法，取得了比全球方法更好的结果。然而，通过更聪明的训练方式，首先重要的数据对于训练更有效，其次，训练块位于低秩子空间中的聚类，我们可以设计一个适用于图像去噪的字典并获得结果靠近最先进的当地方法。在本文中，我们提出一种基于图像构建块的全局聚类的方法。由于聚类的类型在基于聚类的去噪方法中起着重要的作用，我们解决了两个关于聚类的问题。首先，哪些部分数据应该考虑进行聚类？第二，什么样的数据聚类方法适用于去噪？然后利用聚类学习一个完整的字典。通过根据字典原子获得噪声图像块的稀疏分解，实现了去噪版本。除了我们的框架之外，还对7种流行的字典学习方法进行了模拟和比较。结果根据两个主要因素进行比较：（1）去噪性能和（2）执行时间。实验结果表明，我们的字典学习框架在两个因素方面都优于竞争对手。
