##### Abstract
Analysis of scripts plays an important role in paleography and in quantitative linguistics. Especially in the field of digital paleography quantitative features are much needed to differentiate glyphs. We describe an elaborate set of metrics that quantify qualitative information contained in characters and hence indirectly also quantify the scribal features. We broadly divide the metrics into several categories and describe each individual metric with its underlying qualitative significance. The metrics are largely derived from the related area of gesture design and recognition. We also propose several novel metrics. The proposed metrics are soundly grounded on the principles of handwriting production and handwriting analysis. These computed metrics could serve as descriptors for scripts and also be used for comparing and analyzing scripts. We illustrate some quantitative analysis based on the proposed metrics by applying it to the paleographic evolution of the medieval Tamil script from Brahmi. We also outline future work.

脚本分析在古文字和量化语言学中起着重要的作用。特别是在数字古文字领域，定量特征非常需要区分字形。我们描述了一套详细的度量指标，量化字符中包含的定性信息，从而间接量化了抄写特征。我们广泛地将度量分成几个类别，并描述每个度量的基本定性。度量标准很大程度上取决于手势设计和识别的相关领域。我们也提出了几个新颖的指标。所提出的指标完全基于手写生产和笔迹分析的原则。这些计算出的指标可以作为脚本的描述符，也可以用来比较和分析脚本。我们通过将其应用于来自布拉米的中世纪泰米尔语剧本的古文字演变来说明基于所提出的指标的一些定量分析。我们也概述未来的工作。
