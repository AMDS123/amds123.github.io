##### Abstract
Time of flight cameras may emerge as the 3-D sensor of choice. Today, time of flight sensors use phase-based sampling, where the phase delay between emitted and received, high-frequency signals encodes distance. In this paper, we present a new time of flight architecture that relies only on frequency---we refer to this technique as frequency-domain time of flight (FD-TOF). Inspired by optical coherence tomography (OCT), FD-TOF excels when frequency bandwidth is high. With the increasing frequency of TOF sensors, new challenges to time of flight sensing continue to emerge. At high frequencies, FD-TOF offers several potential benefits over phase-based time of flight methods.

飞行时间相机可能会成为选择的3D传感器。今天，飞行时间传感器使用基于相位的采样，其中发射和接收之间的相位延迟，高频信号编码距离。在本文中，我们提出一个仅依赖于频率的新的飞行时间体系结构 - 我们将这种技术称为频域飞行时间（FD-TOF）。受光学相干断层扫描（OCT）的启发，当频率带宽较高时，FD-TOF更胜一筹。随着TOF传感器频率的不断提高，飞行时间传感的新挑战不断涌现。在高频率下，FD-TOF相对于基于阶段的飞行时间方法提供了几个潜在的好处。
