##### Abstract
With the development of Internet culture, cuteness has become a popular concept. Many people are curious about what factors making a person look cute. However, there is rare research to answer this interesting question. In this work, we construct a dataset of personal images with comprehensively annotated cuteness scores and facial attributes to investigate this high-level concept in depth. Based on this dataset, through an automatic attributes mining process, we find several critical attributes determining the cuteness of a person. We also develop a novel Continuous Latent Support Vector Machine (C-LSVM) method to predict the cuteness score of one person given only his image. Extensive evaluations validate the effectiveness of the proposed method for cuteness prediction.

随着互联网文化的发展，可爱已成为一个流行的概念。很多人都很好奇让人看起来很可爱的因素。但是，有一个罕见的研究来回答这个有趣的问题。在这项工作中，我们构建一个个人图像的数据集，全面注释的可爱度和面部属性，深入调查这个高层次的概念。基于这个数据集，通过一个自动的属性挖掘过程，我们发现了几个决定一个人的可爱的关键属性。我们还开发了一种新颖的连续潜像支持向量机（C-LSVM）方法来预测一个人只有他的图像的可爱分数。广泛的评估验证了所提出的可爱预测方法的有效性。
