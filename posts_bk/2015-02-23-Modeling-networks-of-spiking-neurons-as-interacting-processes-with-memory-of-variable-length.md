##### Abstract
We consider a new class of non Markovian processes with a countable number of interacting components, both in discrete and continuous time. Each component is represented by a point process indicating if it has a spike or not at a given time. The system evolves as follows. For each component, the rate (in continuous time) or the probability (in discrete time) of having a spike depends on the entire time evolution of the system since the last spike time of the component. In discrete time this class of systems extends in a non trivial way both Spitzer's interacting particle systems, which are Markovian, and Rissanen's stochastic chains with memory of variable length which have finite state space. In continuous time they can be seen as a kind of Rissanen's variable length memory version of the class of self-exciting point processes which are also called "Hawkes processes", however with infinitely many components. These features make this class a good candidate to describe the time evolution of networks of spiking neurons. In this article we present a critical reader's guide to recent papers dealing with this class of models, both in discrete and in continuous time. We briefly sketch results concerning perfect simulation and existence issues, de-correlation between successive interspike intervals, the longtime behavior of finite non-excited systems and propagation of chaos in mean field systems.

我们考虑一个新的非马尔可夫过程类别，在离散时间和连续时间中都有可数的相互作用成分。每个组件都由一个点过程表示，指出在给定时间内是否有尖峰。系统演变如下。对于每个组件，速率（连续时间）或尖峰概率（离散时间）取决于自组件最后一次峰值时间以来系统的整个时间演变。在离散时间中，这类系统以不平凡的方式扩展了斯皮策的相互作用的粒子系统，即马尔可夫和Rissanen的具有有限状态空间的变长记忆的随机链。在连续的时间里，它们可以被看作是Rissanen的自激点过程类别的变长记忆版本，也被称为“霍克斯过程”，然而其具有无限多的组成部分。这些特征使得这个类可以很好地描述尖峰神经元网络的时间演变。在这篇文章中，我们提出了一个批判性的读者指南，最近的论文处理这类模型，无论是在离散和连续的时间。我们简要地描绘了关于完美模拟和存在问题的结果，连续的插入间隔之间的解相关，有限非激励系统的长期行为和混沌在平均场系统中的传播。
