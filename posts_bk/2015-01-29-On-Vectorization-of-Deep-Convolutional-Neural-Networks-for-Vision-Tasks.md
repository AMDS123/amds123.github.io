##### Abstract
We recently have witnessed many ground-breaking results in machine learning and computer vision, generated by using deep convolutional neural networks (CNN). While the success mainly stems from the large volume of training data and the deep network architectures, the vector processing hardware (e.g. GPU) undisputedly plays a vital role in modern CNN implementations to support massive computation. Though much attention was paid in the extent literature to understand the algorithmic side of deep CNN, little research was dedicated to the vectorization for scaling up CNNs. In this paper, we studied the vectorization process of key building blocks in deep CNNs, in order to better understand and facilitate parallel implementation. Key steps in training and testing deep CNNs are abstracted as matrix and vector operators, upon which parallelism can be easily achieved. We developed and compared six implementations with various degrees of vectorization with which we illustrated the impact of vectorization on the speed of model training and testing. Besides, a unified CNN framework for both high-level and low-level vision tasks is provided, along with a vectorized Matlab implementation with state-of-the-art speed performance.

我们最近见证了使用深度卷积神经网络（CNN）产生的许多机器学习和计算机视觉领域的突破性成果。虽然成功主要源于大量训练数据和深度网络架构，但是矢量处理硬件（例如GPU）无疑在现代CNN实现中起着关键作用，以支持大规模计算。尽管在深度CNN算法方面已经有了很多的关注，但是很少有研究致力于向量化来扩展CNN。在本文中，我们研究了深度CNN中关键构件块的矢量化过程，以便更好地理解和促进并行实现。训练和测试深度CNN的关键步骤被抽象为矩阵和向量运算符，并行性可以很容易地实现。我们开发并比较了六种具有不同程度向量化的实现，我们用这种实现来说明向量化对模型训练和测试速度的影响。此外，还提供统一的CNN高层和低层视觉任务框架，以及具有最先进速度性能的矢量化Matlab实现。
