##### Abstract
There are many Local texture features each very in way they implement and each of the Algorithm trying improve the performance. An attempt is made in this paper to represent a theoretically very simple and computationally effective approach for face recognition. In our implementation the face image is divided into 3x3 sub-regions from which the features are extracted using the Local Binary Pattern (LBP) over a window, fuzzy membership function and at the central pixel. The LBP features possess the texture discriminative property and their computational cost is very low. By utilising the information from LBP, membership function, and central pixel, the limitations of traditional LBP is eliminated. The bench mark database like ORL and Sheffield Databases are used for the evaluation of proposed features with SVM classifier. For the proposed approach K-fold and ROC curves are obtained and results are compared.

每个方法都有很多局部纹理特征，每一个算法都试图提高性能。本文试图表示理论上非常简单和计算有效的人脸识别方法。在我们的实现中，人脸图像被分成3×3个子区域，利用局部二值模式（LBP）在窗口，模糊隶属函数和中心像素处提取特征。 LBP特征具有纹理判别特性，其计算成本很低。通过利用LBP，隶属函数和中心像素的信息，消除了传统LBP的局限性。像ORL和谢菲尔德数据库这样的基准数据库被用于评估用SVM分类器提出的特征。对于所提出的方法，获得K倍和ROC曲线并比较结果。
