##### Abstract
An experimental approach to studying the properties of word embeddings is proposed. Controlled experiments, achieved through modifications of the training corpus, permit the demonstration of direct relations between word properties and word vector direction and length. The approach is demonstrated using the word2vec CBOW model with experiments that independently vary word frequency and word co-occurrence noise. The experiments reveal that word vector length depends more or less linearly on both word frequency and the level of noise in the co-occurrence distribution of the word. The coefficients of linearity depend upon the word. The special point in feature space, defined by the (artificial) word with pure noise in its co-occurrence distribution, is found to be small but non-zero.

提出了一种研究词嵌入特性的实验方法。通过训练语料库的修改实现的受控实验允许证明单词属性与单词向量方向和长度之间的直接关系。该方法使用word2vec CBOW模型进行演示，实验可独立改变词频和词共现噪声。实验表明，单词向量的长度或多或少地与词频和词的共现分布中的噪声水平成线性关系。线性系数取决于单词。特征空间中的特征点被发现是小的，但是非零，由具有纯噪声的（人造的）词在其共现分布中定义。
