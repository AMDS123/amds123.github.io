##### Abstract
This thesis describes the development of fast algorithms for the computation of PERcentage CLOSure of eyes (PERCLOS) and Saccadic Ratio (SR). PERCLOS and SR are two ocular parameters reported to be measures of alertness levels in human beings. PERCLOS is the percentage of time in which at least 80% of the eyelid remains closed over the pupil. Saccades are fast and simultaneous movement of both the eyes in the same direction. SR is the ratio of peak saccadic velocity to the saccadic duration. This thesis addresses the issues of image based estimation of PERCLOS and SR, prevailing in the literature such as illumination variation, poor illumination conditions, head rotations etc. In this work, algorithms for real-time PERCLOS computation has been developed and implemented on an embedded platform. The platform has been used as a case study for assessment of loss of attention in automotive drivers. The SR estimation has been carried out offline as real-time implementation requires high frame rates of processing which is difficult to achieve due to hardware limitations. The accuracy in estimation of the loss of attention using PERCLOS and SR has been validated using brain signals, which are reported to be an authentic cue for estimating the state of alertness in human beings. The major contributions of this thesis include database creation, design and implementation of fast algorithms for estimating PERCLOS and SR on embedded computing platforms.

本文描述了用于计算眼睛PERcentage CLOSure（PERCLOS）和Saccadic Ratio（SR）的快速算法的发展。 PERCLOS和SR是两个眼部参数，据报告是人类警觉水平的度量。 PERCLOS是至少80％的眼睑在瞳孔上关闭的时间百分比。眼眶是同一方向上双眼快速同时移动的。 SR是峰值扫视速度与扫视持续时间的比率。本文研究了PERCLOS和SR的图像估计问题，在文献中主要集中在光照变化，光照条件差，头部旋转等方面。本文研究了PERCLOS实时计算算法，并在嵌入平台。该平台已被用作评估汽车司机失去注意力的案例研究。 SR估计已经离线执行，因为实时实现需要高帧率的处理，这是由于硬件限制而难以实现的。使用PERCLOS和SR估计失去注意力的准确性已经使用大脑信号进行了验证，这些信号据报道是估计人类警觉状态的真实线索。本文的主要贡献包括数据库的创建，快速算法的设计和实现，用于估计嵌入式计算平台上的PERCLOS和SR。
