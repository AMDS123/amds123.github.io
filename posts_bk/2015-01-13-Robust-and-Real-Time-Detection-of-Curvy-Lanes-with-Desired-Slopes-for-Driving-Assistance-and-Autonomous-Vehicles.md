##### Abstract
One of the biggest reasons for road accidents is curvy lanes and blind turns. Even one of the biggest hurdles for new autonomous vehicles is to detect curvy lanes, multiple lanes and lanes with a lot of discontinuity and noise. This paper presents very efficient and advanced algorithm for detecting curves having desired slopes (especially for detecting curvy lanes in real time) and detection of curves (lanes) with a lot of noise, discontinuity and disturbances. Overall aim is to develop robust method for this task which is applicable even in adverse conditions. Even in some of most famous and useful libraries like OpenCV and Matlab, there is no function available for detecting curves having desired slopes , shapes, discontinuities. Only few predefined shapes like circle, ellipse, etc, can be detected using presently available functions. Proposed algorithm can not only detect curves with discontinuity, noise, desired slope but also it can perform shadow and illumination correction and detect/ differentiate between different curves.

交通事故的最大原因之一是弯曲的车道和盲目的转弯。即使是新型自动驾驶车辆的最大障碍之一，也是检测出弯曲的车道，多条车道和多条不连续和噪音的车道。本文提出了非常高效和先进的算法，用于检测具有所需斜率的曲线（尤其用于实时检测弯曲车道）以及检测具有大量噪声，不连续性和干扰的曲线（车道）。总体目标是为这项任务开发稳健的方法，即使在不利的条件下也是适用的。即使在OpenCV和Matlab等一些最着名和有用的库中，也没有可用于检测具有所需斜率，形状，不连续性的曲线的功能。只有几个预定义的形状，如圆形，椭圆形等，可以使用目前可用的功能来检测。提出的算法不仅可以检测具有不连续性，噪声，期望斜率的曲线，而且还可以进行阴影和光照校正，检测/区分不同曲线。
