##### Abstract
Cephalometric analysis has an important role in dentistry and especially in orthodontics as a treatment planning tool to gauge the size and special relationships of the teeth, jaws and cranium. The first step of using such analyses is localizing some important landmarks known as cephalometric landmarks on craniofacial in x-ray image. The past decade has seen a growing interest in automating this process. In this paper, a novel hybrid approach is proposed for automatic detection of cephalometric landmarks. Here, the landmarks are categorized into three main sets according to their anatomical characteristics and usage in well-known cephalometric analyses. Consequently, to have a reliable and accurate detection system, three methods named edge tracing, weighted template matching, and analysis based estimation are designed, each of which is consistent and well-suited for one category. Edge tracing method is suggested to predict those landmarks which are located on edges. Weighted template matching method is well-suited for landmarks located in an obvious and specific structure which can be extracted or searchable in a given x-ray image. The last but not the least method is named analysis based estimation. This method is based on the fact that in cephalometric analyses the relations between landmarks are used and the locations of some landmarks are never used individually. Therefore the third suggested method has a novelty in estimating the desired relations directly. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is compared with the state of the art methods and the results were promising especially in real world applications.

头部测量分析在牙科学，特别是正畸学中起着重要的作用，作为一种治疗计划工具来测量牙齿，颌骨和颅骨的尺寸和特殊关系。使用这种分析的第一步是将一些重要的标志定位在x射线图像的颅面上称为头部测量标志。过去的十年里，人们对这个过程的自动化越来越感兴趣。在本文中，提出了一种新的混合方法自动检测头部测量标志。在这里，根据着名的头部测量分析的解剖学特征和用法，地标被分为三个主要集合。因此，为了建立一个可靠而准确的检测系统，设计了边缘跟踪，加权模板匹配和基于分析的估计三种方法，每种方法都是一致的，适合于一类。建议边缘跟踪法预测位于边缘的地标。加权模板匹配方法非常适用于位于明显和特定结构中的地标，其可以在给定的X射线图像中被提取或搜索。最后但并非最不重要的方法是基于分析的估计。这种方法是基于这样的事实，即在头颅测量分析中使用地标之间的关系，并且一些地标的位置从不单独使用。因此，第三个建议的方法直接估计所需的关系具有新颖性。所提出的方法的有效性与现有技术的方法进行比较，并且结果尤其在现实世界的应用中是有希望的。
