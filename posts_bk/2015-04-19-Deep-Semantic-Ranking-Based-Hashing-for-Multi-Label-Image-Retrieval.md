##### Abstract
With the rapid growth of web images, hashing has received increasing interests in large scale image retrieval. Research efforts have been devoted to learning compact binary codes that preserve semantic similarity based on labels. However, most of these hashing methods are designed to handle simple binary similarity. The complex multilevel semantic structure of images associated with multiple labels have not yet been well explored. Here we propose a deep semantic ranking based method for learning hash functions that preserve multilevel semantic similarity between multi-label images. In our approach, deep convolutional neural network is incorporated into hash functions to jointly learn feature representations and mappings from them to hash codes, which avoids the limitation of semantic representation power of hand-crafted features. Meanwhile, a ranking list that encodes the multilevel similarity information is employed to guide the learning of such deep hash functions. An effective scheme based on surrogate loss is used to solve the intractable optimization problem of nonsmooth and multivariate ranking measures involved in the learning procedure. Experimental results show the superiority of our proposed approach over several state-of-the-art hashing methods in term of ranking evaluation metrics when tested on multi-label image datasets.

随着网络图像的快速增长，哈希算法在大规模图像检索中越来越受到关注。研究工作致力于学习基于标签保持语义相似性的紧凑二进制代码。但是，大多数这些哈希方法被设计来处理简单的二进制相似性。与多个标签相关联的图像复杂的多级语义结构尚未得到很好的探索。在这里，我们提出了一种基于深度语义排序的学习散列函数的方法，以保持多标签图像之间的多级语义相似性。在我们的方法中，将深度卷积神经网络结合到哈希函数中，以共同学习从哈希函数到哈希代码的特征表示和映射，避免了手工特征的语义表征能力的局限性。同时，采用对多级相似度信息进行编码的排序列表来引导对这样的深度散列函数的学习。采用基于代理损失的有效方案来解决学习过程中涉及的非平滑和多变量排序问题的难以解决的优化问题。实验结果表明，在多标签图像数据集上进行测试时，我们所提出的方法优于几种最先进的哈希方法。
