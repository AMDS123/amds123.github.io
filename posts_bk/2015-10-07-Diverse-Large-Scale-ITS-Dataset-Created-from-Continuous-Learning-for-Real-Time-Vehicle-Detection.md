##### Abstract
In traffic engineering, vehicle detectors are trained on limited datasets resulting in poor accuracy when deployed in real world applications. Annotating large-scale high quality datasets is challenging. Typically, these datasets have limited diversity; they do not reflect the real-world operating environment. There is a need for a large-scale, cloud based positive and negative mining (PNM) process and a large-scale learning and evaluation system for the application of traffic event detection. The proposed positive and negative mining process addresses the quality of crowd sourced ground truth data through machine learning review and human feedback mechanisms. The proposed learning and evaluation system uses a distributed cloud computing framework to handle data-scaling issues associated with large numbers of samples and a high-dimensional feature space. The system is trained using AdaBoost on $1,000,000$ Haar-like features extracted from $70,000$ annotated video frames. The trained real-time vehicle detector achieves an accuracy of at least $95\%$ for $1/2$ and about $78\%$ for $19/20$ of the time when tested on approximately $7,500,000$ video frames. At the end of 2015, the dataset is expect to have over one billion annotated video frames.

在交通工程中，车辆检测器在有限的数据集上进行培训，导致在实际应用中部署时精度较差。注释大规模高质量的数据集是具有挑战性的。通常，这些数据集的多样性有限;它们并不反映真实的操作环境。需要一个大规模，基于云计算的正面和负面挖掘（PNM）过程和大规模的学习和评估系统的应用交通事件检测。所提出的正面和负面挖掘过程通过机器学习评估和人类反馈机制来处理人群来源的地面真实数据的质量。所提出的学习和评估系统使用分布式云计算框架来处理与大量样本和高维特征空间相关的数据缩放问题。该系统使用AdaBoost进行培训，从$ 700,000 $注释视频帧中提取$ 1,000,000 $ Haar-like特征。训练有素的实时车辆探测器在大约7,500,000美元的视频帧上进行测试时，对于$ 1/2 $和$ 19/20 $的时间达到至少$ 95 \％$的准确度。在2015年底，数据集预计将有超过10亿注释视频帧。
