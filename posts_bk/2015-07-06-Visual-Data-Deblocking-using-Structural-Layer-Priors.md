##### Abstract
The blocking artifact frequently appears in compressed real-world images or video sequences, especially coded at low bit rates, which is visually annoying and likely hurts the performance of many computer vision algorithms. A compressed frame can be viewed as the superimposition of an intrinsic layer and an artifact one. Recovering the two layers from such frames seems to be a severely ill-posed problem since the number of unknowns to recover is twice as many as the given measurements. In this paper, we propose a simple and robust method to separate these two layers, which exploits structural layer priors including the gradient sparsity of the intrinsic layer, and the independence of the gradient fields of the two layers. A novel Augmented Lagrangian Multiplier based algorithm is designed to efficiently and effectively solve the recovery problem. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the superior performance of our method over the state of the arts, in terms of visual quality and simplicity.

块效应频繁出现在压缩的真实世界的图像或视频序列中，特别是以低比特率编码，这在视觉上令人讨厌并且可能伤害许多计算机视觉算法的性能。压缩的帧可以被看作是本征层和伪像之间的叠加。从这样的帧中恢复两层似乎是一个严重的病态问题，因为要恢复的未知数量是给定测量的两倍。在本文中，我们提出了一个简单稳健的方法来分离这两个层，它利用了包括本征层的梯度稀疏性和两层梯度场的独立性在内的结构层先验。设计了一种新的基于扩展拉格朗日乘子的算法，有效解决了恢复问题。广泛的实验结果表明，我们的方法在视觉质量和简单性方面优于现有技术。
