##### Abstract
Flutter shutter is a technique in which the exposure is chopped into segments and light is only integrated part of the time. By carefully selecting the chopping sequence it is possible to better condition the data for reconstruction problems such as motion deblurring, focal sweeping, and compressed sensing. The partial exposure trades better conditioning for less energy. In problems such as motion deblurring the available energy is what caused the problem in the first place (as strong illumination allows short exposure thus eliminates motion blur). It is still beneficial because the benefit from the better conditioning outweighs the cost in energy. This documents is focused on light efficient flutter shutter that provides better conditioning and better energy utilization than conventional flutter shutter.

颤动快门是一种技术，曝光被分割成片段，光线只是时间的一部分。通过仔细选择斩波序列，可以更好地调整重建问题的数据，如运动去模糊，聚焦扫描和压缩感测。部分曝光换得更好的调节更少的能源。在诸如运动模糊的问题中，可用能量首先是造成问题的原因（因为强照明允许短时间曝光从而消除了运动模糊）。这仍然是有益的，因为更好的条件的好处超过了能源的成本。这些文件专注于光效高的颤动快门，比传统的颤动快门提供更好的调节和更好的能源利用率。
