##### Abstract
In this paper we propose the Structured Deep Neural Network (structured DNN) as a structured and deep learning framework. This approach can learn to find the best structured object (such as a label sequence) given a structured input (such as a vector sequence) by globally considering the mapping relationships between the structures rather than item by item. When automatic speech recognition is viewed as a special case of such a structured learning problem, where we have the acoustic vector sequence as the input and the phoneme label sequence as the output, it becomes possible to comprehensively learn utterance by utterance as a whole, rather than frame by frame. Structured Support Vector Machine (structured SVM) was proposed to perform ASR with structured learning previously, but limited by the linear nature of SVM. Here we propose structured DNN to use nonlinear transformations in multi-layers as a structured and deep learning approach. This approach was shown to beat structured SVM in preliminary experiments on TIMIT.

在本文中，我们提出了结构化深度神经网络（结构化DNN）作为一个结构化的深度学习框架。这种方法可以通过全局考虑结构之间的映射关系而不是逐项来找到给定结构化输入（例如矢量序列）的最佳结构化对象（例如标签序列）。当自动语音识别被视为这种结构化学习问题的特殊情况时，我们将声矢量序列作为输入，将音素标签序列作为输出，从而可以通过整体上的话语全面地学习话语，变得可能比逐帧。结构化支持向量机（structured SVM）被提出用于结构化学习，但受到SVM的线性性质的限制。在这里，我们提出结构化的DNN作为一种结构化的深度学习方法在多层中使用非线性变换。在TIMIT的初步实验中，这种方法被证明击败了结构化SVM。
