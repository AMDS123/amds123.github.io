##### Abstract
Syllable contact pairs crosslinguistically tend to have a falling sonority slope a constraint which is called the Syllable Contact Law SCL In this study the phonotactics of syllable contacts in 4202 CVCCVC words of Persian lexicon is investigated The consonants of Persian were divided into five sonority categories and the frequency of all possible sonority slopes is computed both in lexicon type frequency and in corpus token frequency Since an unmarked phonological structure has been shown to diachronically become more frequent we expect to see the same pattern for syllable contact pairs with falling sonority slope The correlation of sonority categories of the two consonants in a syllable contact pair is measured using Pointwise Mutual Information

跨音律倾向于有一个下降的声音斜率一个约束，这就是所谓的音节接触定律SCL在这项研究中音节接触的声音在4202 CVCCVC词语的波斯词典进行了调查波斯语的辅音分为五个sonority类别和在词典类型频率和语料库标记频率中计算所有可能的音高斜率的频率由于未标记的语音结构已经显示为历时性地变得更频繁，所以我们期望看到具有降低的声音斜率的音节接触对的相同模式。使用Pointwise Mutual Information来测量音节接触对中的两个辅音的类别
