##### Abstract
Event recognition from still images is one of the most important problems for image understanding. However, compared with object recognition and scene recognition, event recognition has received much less research attention in computer vision community. This paper addresses the problem of cultural event recognition in still images and focuses on applying deep learning methods on this problem. In particular, we utilize the successful architecture of Object-Scene Convolutional Neural Networks (OS-CNNs) to perform event recognition. OS-CNNs are composed of object nets and scene nets, which transfer the learned representations from the pre-trained models on large-scale object and scene recognition datasets, respectively. We propose four types of scenarios to explore OS-CNNs for event recognition by treating them as either "end-to-end event predictors" or "generic feature extractors". Our experimental results demonstrate that the global and local representations of OS-CNNs are complementary to each other. Finally, based on our investigation of OS-CNNs, we come up with a solution for the cultural event recognition track at the ICCV ChaLearn Looking at People (LAP) challenge 2015. Our team secures the third place at this challenge and our result is very close to the best performance.

静止图像中的事件识别是图像理解中最重要的问题之一。然而，与物体识别和场景识别相比，事件识别在计算机视觉领域受到的研究更少。本文针对静止图像中的文化事件识别问题，重点研究深度学习方法。具体而言，我们利用对象场景卷积神经网络（OS-CNN）的成功架构来执行事件识别。 OS-CNN由对象网和场景网组成，分别将预先训练好的模型转化为大规模的对象和场景识别数据集。我们提出了四种类型的场景来探索OS-CNN的事件识别，将它们视为“端对端事件预测器”或“通用特征提取器”。我们的实验结果表明OS-CNN的全局和局部表示是互补的。最后，根据我们对OS-CNN的调查，我们提出了2015年ICCV ChaLearn Looking People（LAP）挑战赛中文化事件识别轨道的解决方案。我们的团队在这一挑战中获得第三名，我们的结果是接近最佳表现。
