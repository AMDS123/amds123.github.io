##### Abstract
It is estimated that 285 million people globally are visually impaired. A majority of these people live in developing countries and are among the elderly population. One of the most difficult tasks faced by the visually impaired is identification of people. While naturally, voice recognition is a common method of identification, it is an intuitive and difficult process. The rise of computation capability of mobile devices gives motivation to develop applications that can assist visually impaired persons. With the availability of mobile devices, these people can be assisted by an additional method of identification through intelligent software based on computer vision techniques. In this paper, we present the design and implementation of a face detection and recognition system for the visually impaired through the use of mobile computing. This mobile system is assisted by a server-based support system. The system was tested on a custom video database. Experiment results show high face detection accuracy and promising face recognition accuracy in suitable conditions. The challenges of the system lie in better recognition techniques for difficult situations in terms of lighting and weather.

据估计，全球有2.85亿人视力受损。这些人大部分居住在发展中国家，属于老年人口。视障者面临的最困难的任务之一就是识别人。自然而然，语音识别是一种常见的识别方法，它是一个直观而困难的过程。移动设备计算能力的提高促使开发可以帮助视障人士的应用程序。随着移动设备的可用性，这些人可以通过基于计算机视觉技术的智能软件的另外的识别方法来辅助。在本文中，我们通过使用移动计算为视障人士提出了一个人脸检测和识别系统的设计和实现。该移动系统由基于服务器的支持系统提供支持。系统在定制视频数据库上进行了测试。实验结果表明，在合适的条件下，人脸检测的准确率高，人脸识别准确率高。该系统的挑战在于在照明和天气方面困难情况下的更好的识别技术。
