##### Abstract
This paper presents a novel approach to improve the accuracy of tracking multiple objects in a static scene using a particle filter system by introducing a data association step, a state queue for the collection of tracked objects and adaptive parameters to the system. The data association step makes use of the object detection phase and appearance model to determine if the approximated targets given by the particle filter step match the given set of detected objects. The remaining detected objects are used as information to instantiate new objects for tracking. State queues are also used for each tracked object to deal with occlusion events and occlusion recovery. Finally we present how the parameters adjust to occlusion events. The adaptive property of the system is also used for possible occlusion recovery. Results of the system are then compared to a ground truth data set for performance evaluation. Our system produced accurate results and was able to handle partially occluded objects as well as proper occlusion recovery from tracking multiple objects

本文提出了一种新颖的方法，通过引入数据关联步骤，用于收集被跟踪对象和自适应参数的状态队列到系统，提高了使用粒子滤波系统来跟踪静态场景中多个对象的准确性。数据关联步骤利用物体检测阶段和外观模型来确定由粒子滤波步骤给出的近似目标是否匹配给定的一组检测物体。剩余的被检测的对象被用作实例化用于追踪的新对象的信息。状态队列也用于每个被跟踪对象来处理遮挡事件和遮挡恢复。最后我们介绍参数如何调整到遮挡事件。该系统的自适应属性也用于可能的遮挡恢复。然后将该系统的结果与用于性能评估的地面实况数据集进行比较。我们的系统产生了准确的结果，并且能够处理部分遮挡的物体以及跟踪多个物体的正确遮挡恢复
