##### Abstract
This research explores the effects of various training settings from Polish to English Statistical Machine Translation system for spoken language. Various elements of the TED parallel text corpora for the IWSLT 2013 evaluation campaign were used as the basis for training of language models, and for development, tuning and testing of the translation system. The BLEU, NIST, METEOR and TER metrics were used to evaluate the effects of data preparations on translation results. Our experiments included systems, which use stems and morphological information on Polish words. We also conducted a deep analysis of provided Polish data as preparatory work for the automatic data correction and cleaning phase.
