##### Abstract
Recent developments in the domain of agricultural robotics have resulted in development of complex and efficient systems. Most of the land owners in the South Asian region are low income farmers. The agricultural experience for them is still a completely manual process. However, the extreme weather conditions, heat and flooding, often combine to put a lot of stress on these small land owners and the associated labor. In this paper, we propose a prototype for an automated power reaper for the wheat crop. This automated vehicle is navigated using a simple vision based approach employing the low-cost camera and assisted GPS. The mechanical platform is driven by three motors controlled through an interface between the proposed vision algorithm and the electrical drive. The proposed methodology is applied on some real field scenarios to demonstrate the efficiency of the vision based algorithm.

##### Abstract (translated by Google)
最近在农业机器人领域的发展已经导致了复杂而高效的系统的发展。南亚地区的大部分土地所有者都是低收入农民。他们的农业经验还是一个完全手工的过程。然而，极端的气候条件，高温和洪水，往往结合起来，这些小土地所有者和相关的劳动力很大的压力。在本文中，我们提出了小麦作物自动化收割机的原型。使用低成本照相机和辅助GPS，使用简单的基于视觉的方法导航该自动车辆。机械平台由三个电机驱动，三个电机通过所提出的视觉算法和电力驱动之间的接口进行控制。所提出的方法被应用于一些真实场景中，以展示基于视觉的算法的效率。
