##### Abstract
The guided filter is a technique for edge-aware image filtering. Because of its nice visual quality, fast speed, and ease of implementation, the guided filter has witnessed various applications in real products, such as image editing apps in phones and stereo reconstruction, and has been included in official MATLAB and OpenCV. In this note, we remind that the guided filter can be simply sped up from O(N) time to O(N/s^2) time for a subsampling ratio s. In a variety of applications, this leads to a speedup of >10x with almost no visible degradation. We hope this acceleration will improve performance of current applications and further popularize this filter. Code is released.

##### Abstract (translated by Google)
导向滤波器是用于边缘感知图像滤波的技术。由于具有视觉效果好，速度快，易于实现的特点，引导滤波器在手机图像编辑应用，立体声重建等实际产品中见证了各种应用，并被纳入官方的MATLAB和OpenCV。在本文中，我们提醒我们可以简单地从O（N）时间到O（N / s ^ 2）时间加速引导滤波器，得到子采样率s。在各种应用中，这导致大于10倍的加速，几乎没有明显的退化。我们希望这种加速能够提高当前应用的性能，并进一步推广这个过滤器。代码被释放。
