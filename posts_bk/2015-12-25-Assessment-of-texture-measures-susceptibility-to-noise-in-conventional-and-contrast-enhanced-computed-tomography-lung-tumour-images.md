##### Abstract
Noise is one of the major problems that hinder an effective texture analysis of disease in medical images, which may cause variability in the reported diagnosis. In this paper seven texture measurement methods (two wavelet, two model and three statistical based) were applied to investigate their susceptibility to subtle noise caused by acquisition and reconstruction deficiencies in computed tomography (CT) images. Features of lung tumours were extracted from two different conventional and contrast enhanced CT image data-sets under filtered and noisy conditions. When measuring the noise in the background open-air region of the analysed CT images, noise of Gaussian and Rayleigh distributions with varying mean and variance was encountered, and Fisher distance was used to differentiate between an original extracted lung tumour region of interest (ROI) with the filtered and noisy reconstructed versions. It was determined that the wavelet packet (WP) and fractal dimension measures were the least affected, while the Gaussian Markov random field, run-length and co-occurrence matrices were the most affected by noise. Depending on the selected ROI size, it was concluded that texture measures with fewer extracted features can decrease susceptibility to noise, with the WP and the Gabor filter having a stable performance in both filtered and noisy CT versions and for both data-sets. Knowing how robust each texture measure under noise presence is can assist physicians using an automated lung texture classification system in choosing the appropriate feature extraction algorithm for a more accurate diagnosis.

噪声是妨碍对医学图像中的疾病的有效质地分析的主要问题之一，这可能导致所报告的诊断的变化。本文采用七种纹理测量方法（两种小波，两种模型和三种统计学基础）来研究计算机断层扫描（CT）图像中由于获取和重建缺陷引起的细微噪声敏感性。在过滤和噪声条件下，从两种不同的常规和对比增强的CT图像数据集中提取肺肿瘤的特征。在分析的CT图像的背景露天区域中测量噪声时，遇到具有变化的均值和方差的高斯和瑞利分布的噪声，并且使用Fisher距离来区分原始提取的感兴趣的肺部肿瘤区域（ROI）与过滤和嘈杂的重建版本。确定了小波包（WP）和分形维数测度受影响最小，而高斯马尔可夫随机场，游程长度和共生矩阵受噪声影响最大。根据选定的ROI大小，可以得出结论：具有较少提取特征的纹理测量可以降低对噪声的敏感性，WP和Gabor滤波器在过滤和噪声CT版本以及两个数据集中都具有稳定的性能。了解每种纹理测量在噪声存在下如何强大可以帮助医生使用自动肺纹理分类系统来选择适当的特征提取算法，以获得更准确的诊断。
