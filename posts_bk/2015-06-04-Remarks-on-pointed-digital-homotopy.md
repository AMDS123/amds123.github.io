##### Abstract
We present and explore in detail a pair of digital images with $c_u$-adjacencies that are homotopic but not pointed homotopic. For two digital loops $f,g: [0,m]_Z \rightarrow X$ with the same basepoint, we introduce the notion of {\em tight at the basepoint (TAB)} pointed homotopy, which is more restrictive than ordinary pointed homotopy and yields some different results. We present a variant form of the digital fundamental group. Based on what we call {\em eventually constant} loops, this version of the fundamental group is equivalent to that of Boxer (1999), but offers the advantage that eventually constant maps are often easier to work with than the trivial extensions that are key to the development of the fundamental group in Boxer (1999) and many subsequent papers. We show that homotopy equivalent digital images have isomorphic fundamental groups, even when the homotopy equivalence does not preserve the basepoint. This assertion appeared in Boxer (2005), but there was an error in the proof; here, we correct the error.

##### Abstract (translated by Google)
我们详细地介绍和探索一对数字图像，其中$ c_u $  -  adjacencies是同伦的，但不是尖的同伦。对于具有相同基点的两个数字环$ f，g：[0，m] _Z \ rightarrow X $，我们引入了在基点（TAB）}指向同伦的概念，同伦并产生一些不同的结果。我们提出了一个数字基础组的变体形式。根据我们所说的最终常数循环，这个版本的基本组与Boxer（1999）的版本是相同的，但是它的优点是最终常量映射通常比简单的扩展更容易处理义和团（1999）的基本群体的发展以及后来的许多论文。我们证明同伦等价数字图像具有同构的基本群，即使同伦等价不保留基点。 Boxer（2005）中出现了这种说法，但是证据有误，在这里，我们纠正错误。
