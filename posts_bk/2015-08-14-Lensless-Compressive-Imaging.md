##### Abstract
We develop a lensless compressive imaging architecture, which consists of an aperture assembly and a single sensor, without using any lens. An anytime algorithm is proposed to reconstruct images from the compressive measurements; the algorithm produces a sequence of solutions that monotonically converge to the true signal (thus, anytime). The algorithm is developed based on the sparsity of local overlapping patches (in the transformation domain) and state-of-the-art results have been obtained. Experiments on real data demonstrate that encouraging results are obtained by measuring about 10% (of the image pixels) compressive measurements. The reconstruction results of the proposed algorithm are compared with the JPEG compression (based on file sizes) and the reconstructed image quality is close to the JPEG compression, in particular at a high compression rate.

我们开发了一种无透镜压缩成像结构，其中包括一个光圈组件和一个传感器，而不使用任何透镜。提出了随时间算法来重建来自压缩测量的图像;该算法产生一系列单调收敛于真实信号（因此随时）的解决方案。该算法是基于局部重叠斑块的稀疏性（在变换域）开发的，并得到了最新的结果。实际数据的实验表明，通过测量大约10％（图像像素）的压缩测量结果可获得令人鼓舞的结果。将所提算法的重建结果与JPEG压缩算法（基于文件大小）进行比较，重建后的图像质量接近于JPEG压缩，特别是在高压缩率情况下。
