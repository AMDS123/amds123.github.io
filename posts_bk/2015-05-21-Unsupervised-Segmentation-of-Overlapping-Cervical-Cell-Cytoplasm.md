##### Abstract
Overlapping of cervical cells and poor contrast of cell cytoplasm are the major issues in accurate detection and segmentation of cervical cells. An unsupervised cell segmentation approach is presented here. Cell clump segmentation was carried out using the extended depth of field (EDF) image created from the images of different focal planes. A modified Otsu method with prior class weights is proposed for accurate segmentation of nuclei from the cell clumps. The cell cytoplasm was further segmented from cell clump depending upon the number of nucleus detected in that cell clump. Level set model was used for cytoplasm segmentation.

宫颈细胞重叠和细胞质对比度差是宫颈细胞准确检测和分割的主要问题。这里介绍一种无监督的细胞分割方法。使用从不同焦平面的图像创建的扩展景深（EDF）图像进行细胞团块分割。提出了一种改进的Otsu方法，该方法具有先验类权重，可以准确地从细胞团块中分割细胞核。根据在细胞团中检测到的细胞核的数目，细胞质从细胞团进一步分割。水平集模型用于细胞质分割。
