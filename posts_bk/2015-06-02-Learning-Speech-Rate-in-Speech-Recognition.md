##### Abstract
A significant performance reduction is often observed in speech recognition when the rate of speech (ROS) is too low or too high. Most of present approaches to addressing the ROS variation focus on the change of speech signals in dynamic properties caused by ROS, and accordingly modify the dynamic model, e.g., the transition probabilities of the hidden Markov model (HMM). However, an abnormal ROS changes not only the dynamic but also the static property of speech signals, and thus can not be compensated for purely by modifying the dynamic model. This paper proposes an ROS learning approach based on deep neural networks (DNN), which involves an ROS feature as the input of the DNN model and so the spectrum distortion caused by ROS can be learned and compensated for. The experimental results show that this approach can deliver better performance for too slow and too fast utterances, demonstrating our conjecture that ROS impacts both the dynamic and the static property of speech. In addition, the proposed approach can be combined with the conventional HMM transition adaptation method, offering additional performance gains.

当语速（ROS）太低或太高时，经常在语音识别中观察到显着的性能降低。目前处理ROS变化的方法大多集中在由ROS引起的动态特性中语音信号的变化，并相应地修改动态模型，例如隐马尔可夫模型（HMM）的转移概率。然而，ROS的异常不仅改变了语音信号的动态特性，也改变了语音信号的静态特性，因此不能单纯通过修改动态模型来进行补偿。本文提出了一种基于深度神经网络（DNN）的ROS学习方法，该方法将ROS特征作为DNN模型的输入，从而学习和补偿由ROS引起的频谱失真。实验结果表明，这种方法可以提供更好的表现，太慢和太快的话语，这表明我们的猜测，活性氧同时影响语音的动态和静态属性。另外，所提出的方法可以与传统的HMM转换适应方法相结合，提供额外的性能收益。
