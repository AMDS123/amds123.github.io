##### Abstract
Robots have revolutionized our way of life in recent years.One of the domains that has not yet completely benefited from the robotic automation is the agricultural sector. Agricultural Robotics should complement humans in the arduous tasks during different sub-domains of this sector. Extensive research in Agricultural Robotics has been carried out in Japan, USA, Australia and Germany focusing mainly on the heavy agricultural machinery. Pakistan is an agricultural rich country and its economy and food security are closely tied with agriculture in general and wheat in particular. However, agricultural research in Pakistan is still carried out using the conventional methodologies. This paper is an attempt to trigger the research in this modern domain so that we can benefit from cost effective and resource efficient autonomous agricultural methodologies. This paper focuses on a scalable low cost semi-autonomous technique for wheat harvest which primarily focuses on the farmers with small land holdings. The main focus will be on the vision part of the navigation system deployed by the proposed robot.

##### Abstract (translated by Google)
机器人近年来彻底改变了我们的生活方式。农业部门还没有完全从机器人自动化中受益。农业机器人应该在这个行业的不同子领域艰巨的任务中补充人类。在日本，美国，澳大利亚和德国，农业机器人已经进行了大量的研究，重点是重型农业机械。巴基斯坦是一个农业富国，经济和粮食安全与农业普遍紧密相关，尤其与小麦紧密相关。但是，巴基斯坦的农业研究仍然采用传统的方法进行。本文试图触发这个现代领域的研究，以便我们能够从成本有效和资源有效的自治农业方法中受益。本文侧重于一个可扩展的低成本半自主小麦收获技术，主要侧重于土地拥有量小的农民。主要重点将放在由机器人部署的导航系统的视觉部分。
