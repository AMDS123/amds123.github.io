##### Abstract
Image aesthetic evaluation has attracted much attention in recent years. Image aesthetic evaluation methods heavily depend on the effective aesthetic feature. Traditional meth-ods always extract hand-crafted features. However, these hand-crafted features are always designed to adapt particu-lar datasets, and extraction of them needs special design. Rather than extracting hand-crafted features, an automati-cally learn of aesthetic features based on deep convolutional neural network (DCNN) is first adopt in this paper. As we all know, when the training dataset is given, the DCNN architecture with high complexity may meet the over-fitting problem. On the other side, the DCNN architecture with low complexity would not efficiently extract effective features. For these reasons, we further propose a paralleled convolutional neural network (PDCNN) with multi-level structures to automatically adapt to the training dataset. Experimental results show that our proposed PDCNN architecture achieves better performance than other traditional methods.

形象美学评价近年来备受关注。形象审美评价方法在很大程度上取决于有效的审美特征传统的方法总是提取手工制作的特征。然而，这些手工制作的功能总是被设计为适应特定的数据集，并且提取它们需要特殊的设计。本文首先采用基于深度卷积神经网络（DCNN）的自动学习美学特征，而不是提取手工特征。众所周知，在给定训练数据集时，高复杂度的DCNN结构可能会遇到过度拟合的问题。另一方面，低复杂度的DCNN结构不能有效地提取有效的特征。由于这些原因，我们进一步提出了一种具有多级结构的并行卷积神经网络（PDCNN）来自动适应训练数据集。实验结果表明，我们提出的PDCNN架构实现比其他传统方法更好的性能。
