##### Abstract
We develop necessary and sufficient conditions and a novel provably consistent and efficient algorithm for discovering topics (latent factors) from observations (documents) that are realized from a probabilistic mixture of shared latent factors that have certain properties. Our focus is on the class of topic models in which each shared latent factor contains a novel word that is unique to that factor, a property that has come to be known as separability. Our algorithm is based on the key insight that the novel words correspond to the extreme points of the convex hull formed by the row-vectors of a suitably normalized word co-occurrence matrix. We leverage this geometric insight to establish polynomial computation and sample complexity bounds based on a few isotropic random projections of the rows of the normalized word co-occurrence matrix. Our proposed random-projections-based algorithm is naturally amenable to an efficient distributed implementation and is attractive for modern web-scale distributed data mining applications.

我们开发了必要和充分的条件和一个新的可证明的一致和高效的算法来发现观察（文件）的主题（潜在因素），从具有一定特性的共享潜在因素的概率混合实现。我们关注的是一类主题模型，其中每个共享的潜在因素都包含一个独特于该因素的新词，这个词被称为可分性。我们的算法是基于这样一个关键的认识，即新词对应于适当归一化的词共生矩阵的行向量形成的凸包的极值点。我们利用这种几何的洞察力建立多项式计算和样本的复杂性边界基于归一化字共生矩阵行的几个各向同性随机投影。我们提出的基于随机投影的算法自然适用于高效的分布式实现，并且对于现代网络规模的分布式数据挖掘应用程序具有吸引力。
