##### Abstract
In this paper a new fractal image compression algorithm is proposed in which the time of encoding process is considerably reduced. The algorithm exploits a domain pool reduction approach, along with using innovative predefined values for contrast scaling factor, S, instead of scanning the parameter space [0,1]. Within this approach only domain blocks with entropies greater than a threshold are considered. As a novel point, it is assumed that in each step of the encoding process, the domain block with small enough distance shall be found only for the range blocks with low activity (equivalently low entropy). This novel point is used to find reasonable estimations of S, and use them in the encoding process as predefined values, mentioned above. The algorithm has been examined for some well-known images. This result shows that our proposed algorithm considerably reduces the encoding time producing images that are approximately the same in quality.

本文提出了一种新的分形图像压缩算法，其编码过程的时间明显缩短。该算法利用了一个域池缩减方法，同时使用创新的预定义的对比度缩放因子S来代替扫描参数空间[0,1]。在这种方法中，只考虑熵大于阈值的域块。作为一个新颖点，假设在编码过程的每一步中，只有低活动范围块（等熵熵低）才能找到距离足够小的域块。这个新颖的点用来找到S的合理估计，并且在编码过程中将它们用作预定义的值，如上所述。该算法已被检查了一些众所周知的图像。这个结果表明，我们提出的算法大大减少了编码时间产生质量大致相同的图像。
