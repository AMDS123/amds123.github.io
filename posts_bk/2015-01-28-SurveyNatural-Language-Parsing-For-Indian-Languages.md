##### Abstract
Syntactic parsing is a necessary task which is required for NLP applications including machine translation. It is a challenging task to develop a qualitative parser for morphological rich and agglutinative languages. Syntactic analysis is used to understand the grammatical structure of a natural language sentence. It outputs all the grammatical information of each word and its constituent. Also issues related to it help us to understand the language in a more detailed way. This literature survey is groundwork to understand the different parser development for Indian languages and various approaches that are used to develop such tools and techniques. This paper provides a survey of research papers from well known journals and conferences.

语法分析是包括机器翻译在内的NLP应用程序所必需的。开发形态丰富和凝集的语言的定性分析器是一项具有挑战性的任务。句法分析用于理解自然语言句子的语法结构。它输出每个单词及其组成部分的所有语法信息。与此相关的问题也帮助我们更详细地理解语言。这个文献调查是了解印度语言的不同解析器开发和用于开发这些工具和技术的各种方法的基础。本文对知名期刊和会议的研究论文进行了调查。
