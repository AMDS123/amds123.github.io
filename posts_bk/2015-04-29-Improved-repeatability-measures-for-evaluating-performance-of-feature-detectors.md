##### Abstract
The most frequently employed measure for performance characterisation of local feature detectors is repeatability, but it has been observed that this does not necessarily mirror actual performance. Presented are improved repeatability formulations which correlate much better with the true performance of feature detectors. Comparative results for several state-of-the-art feature detectors are presented using these measures; it is found that Hessian-based detectors are generally superior at identifying features when images are subject to various geometric and photometric transformations.

用于局部特征检测器的性能表征的最经常采用的测量是可重复的，但是已经观察到，这不一定反映实际性能。提出改进的重复性配方与特征探测器的真实性能相关性更好。使用这些措施提出了几种最先进的特征探测器的比较结果;发现基于Hessian的检测器在图像受到各种几何和光度转换时识别特征方面通常是优越的。
