##### Abstract
Parkinson's disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative movement disorder where motor dysfunction gradually increases as the disease progress. In addition to administering dopaminergic PD-specific drugs, attending neurologists strongly recommend regular exercise combined with physiotherapy. However, because of the long-term nature of the disease, patients following traditional rehabilitation programs may get bored, lose interest and eventually drop out as a direct result of the repeatability and predictability of the prescribed exercises. Technology supported opportunities to liven up a daily exercise schedule have appeared in the form of character-based, virtual reality games which promote physical training in a non-linear and looser fashion and provide an experience that varies from one game loop the next. Such "exergames", a word that results from the amalgamation of the words "exercise" and "game" challenge patients into performing movements of varying complexity in a playful and immersive virtual environment. Today's game consoles such as Nintendo's Wii, Sony PlayStation Eye and Microsoft's Kinect sensor present new opportunities to infuse motivation and variety to an otherwise mundane physiotherapy routine. In this paper we present some of these approaches, discuss their suitability for these PD patients, mainly on the basis of demands made on balance, agility and gesture precision, and present design principles that exergame platforms must comply with in order to be suitable for PD patients.

##### Abstract (translated by Google)
帕金森病（PD）是一种进行性神经退行性运动障碍，其中随着疾病进展，运动功能障碍逐渐增加。除了服用多巴胺能PD特定药物外，主治神经科医生强烈建议经常运动和物理治疗相结合。然而，由于疾病的长期性质，传统康复项目的患者可能会感到无聊，失去兴趣，并最终退出，直接导致规定的练习的可重复性和可预测性。技术支持每天锻炼日程的机会已经出现在以角色为基础的虚拟现实游戏中，以非线性和宽松的方式促进体能训练，并提供一种不同于下一个游戏循环的体验。这种“锻炼”和“游戏”这两个词汇结合起来的一个词，就是在一个有趣的，沉浸式的虚拟环境中挑战病人进行复杂的运动。如今任天堂的Wii，索尼的PlayStation Eye和微软的Kinect传感器这样的游戏机提供了新的机会，将动力和多样性灌输到一个普通的物理治疗程序中。在本文中，我们将介绍其中的一些方法，主要基于平衡性，敏捷性和手势精度的要求，讨论它们对这些PD患者的适应性，并提出exergame平台必须遵守的设计原则以便适合PD耐心。
