##### Abstract
Imaging and Image sensors is a field that is continuously evolving. There are new products coming into the market every day. Some of these have very severe Size, Weight and Power constraints whereas other devices have to handle very high computational loads. Some require both these conditions to be met simultaneously. Current imaging architectures and digital image processing solutions will not be able to meet these ever increasing demands. There is a need to develop novel imaging architectures and image processing solutions to address these requirements. In this work we propose analog signal processing as a solution to this problem. The analog processor is not suggested as a replacement to a digital processor but it will be used as an augmentation device which works in parallel with the digital processor, making the system faster and more efficient. In order to show the merits of analog processing two stereo correspondence algorithms are implemented. We propose novel modifications to the algorithms and new imaging architectures which, significantly reduces the computation time.

成像和图像传感器是一个不断发展的领域。每天有新产品进入市场。其中一些具有非常严格的尺寸，重量和功率限制，而其他设备必须处理非常高的计算负荷。有些要求同时满足这些条件。目前的成像架构和数字图像处理解决方案将无法满足这些不断增长的需求。有必要开发新颖的成像体系结构和图像处理解决方案来满足这些要求。在这项工作中，我们提出模拟信号处理作为解决这个问题的方法。模拟处理器不建议作为数字处理器的替代品，但它将用作与数字处理器并行工作的增强设备，使系统更快更高效。为了展示模拟处理的优点，实现了两个立体对应算法。我们提出了新的修改算法和新的成像架构，大大减少了计算时间。
