##### Abstract
False alarm is one of the main concerns in intensive care units and can result in care disruption, sleep deprivation, and insensitivity of care-givers to alarms. Several methods have been proposed to suppress the false alarm rate through improving the quality of physiological signals by filtering, and developing more accurate sensors. However, significant intrinsic correlation among the extracted features limits the performance of most currently available data mining techniques, as they often discard the predictors with low individual impact that may potentially have strong discriminatory power when grouped with others. We propose a model based on coalition game theory that considers the inter-features dependencies in determining the salient predictors in respect to false alarm, which results in improved classification accuracy. The superior performance of this method compared to current methods is shown in simulation results using PhysionNet's MIMIC II database.

假警报是重症监护室的主要问题之一，可能会导致护理中断，睡眠不足，护理人员对警报不敏感。已经提出了几种方法来通过过滤提高生理信号的质量来抑制误报率，并开发更精确的传感器。然而，所提取的特征之间的显着的内在相关性限制了大多数当前可用的数据挖掘技术的性能，因为它们经常丢弃具有低个人影响的预测因子，当与其他人分组时可能具有强烈的区分能力。我们提出了一个基于联合博弈理论的模型，该模型考虑了特征间的依赖关系来确定虚警的显着预测因子，从而提高了分类精度。使用PhysionNet的MIMIC II数据库的仿真结果显示了与现有方法相比，该方法的优越性能。
