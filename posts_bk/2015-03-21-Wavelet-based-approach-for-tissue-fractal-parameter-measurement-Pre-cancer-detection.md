##### Abstract
In this paper, we have carried out the detail studies of pre-cancer by wavelet coherency and multifractal based detrended fluctuation analysis (MFDFA) on differential interference contrast (DIC) images of stromal region among different grades of pre-cancer tissues. Discrete wavelet transform (DWT) through Daubechies basis has been performed for identifying fluctuations over polynomial trends for clear characterization and differentiation of tissues. Wavelet coherence plots are performed for identifying the level of correlation in time scale plane between normal and various grades of DIC samples. Applying MFDFA on refractive index variations of cervical tissues, we have observed that the values of Hurst exponent (correlation) decreases from healthy (normal) to pre-cancer tissues. The width of singularity spectrum has a sudden degradation at grade-I in comparison of healthy (normal) tissue but later on it increases as cancer progresses from grade-II to grade-III.

本文利用小波多尺度相关性和基于多重分形的去趋势波动分析（MFDFA）对不同级别癌前组织间质区域的微分干涉对比（DIC）图像进行了前瞻性肿瘤细胞研究。已经执行了通过Daubechies基础的离散小波变换（DWT）来识别多项式趋势的波动，以清楚地表征和分化组织。小波相干图是为了识别正常和不同等级的DIC样本之间在时间尺度平面上的相关程度。将MFDFA应用于宫颈组织的折射率变化，我们观察到Hurst指数（相关性）从健康（正常）值降低到癌前组织。奇异谱的宽度在健康（正常）组织的比较中在I级突然降低，但是随着癌症从II级到III级，奇异谱的宽度增加。
