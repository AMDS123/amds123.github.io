##### Abstract
By analyzing human readers' performance in detecting small round lesions in simulated digital breast tomosynthesis background in a location known exactly scenario, we have developed a model observer that is a better predictor of human performance with different levels of background complexity (i.e., anatomical and quantum noise). Our analysis indicates that human observers perform a lesion detection task by combining a number of sub-decisions, each an indicator of the presence of a lesion in the image stack. This is in contrast to a channelized Hotelling observer, where the detection task is conducted holistically by thresholding a single decision variable, made from an optimally weighted linear combination of channels. However, it seems that the sub-par performance of human readers compared to the CHO cannot be fully explained by their reliance on sub-decisions, or perhaps we do not consider a sufficient number of sub-decisions. To bridge the gap between the performances of human readers and the model observer based upon sub-decisions, we use an additive noise model, the power of which is modulated with the level of background complexity. The proposed model observer better predicts the fast drop in human detection performance with background complexity.

通过分析人类阅读者在模拟数字化乳腺断层合成背景中检测小圆形病变的性能，我们已经开发了一种模型观察者，其是在不同的背景复杂度水平（即，解剖和量子水平噪声）。我们的分析表明，人类观察者通过组合多个子决策来执行病变检测任务，每个子决策都是图像堆栈中存在病变的指示器。这与一个信道化的Hotelling观察者形成对比，在这个观察者中，检测任务是通过对由一个最佳加权的线性信道组合进行的单个决策变量进行阈值整体进行的。但是，与CHO相比，人类阅读者的低于标准的表现似乎不能完全被他们依赖于子决策所解释，或者我们没有考虑足够多的子决定。为了弥补人类阅读者和模型观察者基于子决策之间的差距，我们使用了一个加性噪声模型，其加权的背景复杂度被调制。所提出的模型观测器能够更好地预测人体检测性能随背景复杂度的下降。
