##### Abstract
Content based Document Classification is one of the biggest challenges in the context of free text mining. Current algorithms on document classifications mostly rely on cluster analysis based on bag-of-words approach. However that method is still being applied to many modern scientific dilemmas. It has established a strong presence in fields like economics and social science to merit serious attention from the researchers. In this paper we would like to propose and explore an alternative grounded more securely on the dictionary classification and correlatedness of words and phrases. It is expected that application of our existing knowledge about the underlying classification structure may lead to improvement of the classifier's performance.

基于内容的文档分类是自由文本挖掘的最大挑战之一。目前文档分类算法主要依靠基于词袋方法的聚类分析。然而，这种方法仍然被应用于许多现代科学的困境。在经济和社会科学等领域建立了强大的影响力，受到研究人员的高度重视。在本文中，我们希望提出并探索一个更加安全的字典分类和相关性的单词和短语的替代方案。预计应用我们现有的关于分类结构的知识可能会导致分类器性能的提高。
