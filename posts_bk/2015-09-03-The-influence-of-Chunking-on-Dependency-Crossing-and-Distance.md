##### Abstract
This paper hypothesizes that chunking plays important role in reducing dependency distance and dependency crossings. Computer simulations, when compared with natural languages,show that chunking reduces mean dependency distance (MDD) of a linear sequence of nodes (constrained by continuity or projectivity) to that of natural languages. More interestingly, chunking alone brings about less dependency crossings as well, though having failed to reduce them, to such rarity as found in human languages. These results suggest that chunking may play a vital role in the minimization of dependency distance, and a somewhat contributing role in the rarity of dependency crossing. In addition, the results point to a possibility that the rarity of dependency crossings is not a mere side-effect of minimization of dependency distance, but a linguistic phenomenon with its own motivations.

##### Abstract (translated by Google)
本文假设分块在减少依赖距离和依赖交叉方面起着重要的作用。与自然语言相比，计算机模拟显示分块减少了线性节点序列（由连续性或投影性所限制）的平均依赖距离（MDD）与自然语言的平均依赖性距离（MDD）。更有意思的是，单独分块还可以减少依赖关系，尽管没有减少到人类语言中的稀缺程度。这些结果表明，组合可能在减少依赖距离方面起着至关重要的作用，并且对依赖交叉的稀有性有一定的贡献作用。另外，结果表明，依赖交叉的稀有性不仅仅是依赖距离最小化的一个副作用，而是具有自身动机的语言现象。
