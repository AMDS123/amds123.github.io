##### Abstract
In this work, we introduce a deep-structured conditional random field (DS-CRF) model for the purpose of state-based object silhouette tracking. The proposed DS-CRF model consists of a series of state layers, where each state layer spatially characterizes the object silhouette at a particular point in time. The interactions between adjacent state layers are established by inter-layer connectivity dynamically determined based on inter-frame optical flow. By incorporate both spatial and temporal context in a dynamic fashion within such a deep-structured probabilistic graphical model, the proposed DS-CRF model allows us to develop a framework that can accurately and efficiently track object silhouettes that can change greatly over time, as well as under different situations such as occlusion and multiple targets within the scene. Experiment results using video surveillance datasets containing different scenarios such as occlusion and multiple targets showed that the proposed DS-CRF approach provides strong object silhouette tracking performance when compared to baseline methods such as mean-shift tracking, as well as state-of-the-art methods such as context tracking and boosted particle filtering.

在这项工作中，我们引入了一个深度结构的条件随机场（DS-CRF）模型，用于基于状态的对象轮廓跟踪。所提出的DS-CRF模型由一系列状态层组成，其中每个状态层在特定的时间点空间地表征对象轮廓。相邻状态层之间的交互通过基于帧间光流动态确定的层间连接来建立。通过在这样一个深层次的概率图模型中以动态的方式结合空间和时间上下文，所提出的DS-CRF模型允许我们开发一个框架，能够准确有效地跟踪随时间变化很大的对象轮廓如在场景内的不同情况下，例如遮挡和多个目标。使用含有不同场景（如遮挡和多个目标）的视频监视数据集的实验结果表明，与基线方法（如均值偏移跟踪）相比，所提出的DS-CRF方法提供了强大的对象轮廓跟踪性能，艺术方法，如上下文跟踪和增强粒子滤波。
