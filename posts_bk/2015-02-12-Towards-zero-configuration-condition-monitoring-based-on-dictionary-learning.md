##### Abstract
Condition-based predictive maintenance can significantly improve overall equipment effectiveness provided that appropriate monitoring methods are used. Online condition monitoring systems are customized to each type of machine and need to be reconfigured when conditions change, which is costly and requires expert knowledge. Basic feature extraction methods limited to signal distribution functions and spectra are commonly used, making it difficult to automatically analyze and compare machine conditions. In this paper, we investigate the possibility to automate the condition monitoring process by continuously learning a dictionary of optimized shift-invariant feature vectors using a well-known sparse approximation method. We study how the feature vectors learned from a vibration signal evolve over time when a fault develops within a ball bearing of a rotating machine. We quantify the adaptation rate of learned features and find that this quantity changes significantly in the transitions between normal and faulty states of operation of the ball bearing.

如果采用适当的监测方法，基于条件的预测性维护可以显着提高整体设备的有效性。在线状态监测系统针对每种类型的机器进行定制，并且在条件改变时需要重新配置，这是昂贵的并且需要专业知识。基本特征提取方法受限于信号分布函数和频谱，因此很难自动分析和比较机器条件。在本文中，我们研究了通过使用众所周知的稀疏近似方法连续学习优化的平移不变特征向量的字典来使状态监视过程自动化的可能性。我们研究在旋转机械的滚珠轴承内发生故障时，从振动信号中学习的特征向量如何随时间发展。我们量化学习特征的适应率，发现这个数量在滚珠轴承的正常运行状态和错误状态之间的转换中显着变化。
