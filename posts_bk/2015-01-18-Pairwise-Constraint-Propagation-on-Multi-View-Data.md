##### Abstract
This paper presents a graph-based learning approach to pairwise constraint propagation on multi-view data. Although pairwise constraint propagation has been studied extensively, pairwise constraints are usually defined over pairs of data points from a single view, i.e., only intra-view constraint propagation is considered for multi-view tasks. In fact, very little attention has been paid to inter-view constraint propagation, which is more challenging since pairwise constraints are now defined over pairs of data points from different views. In this paper, we propose to decompose the challenging inter-view constraint propagation problem into semi-supervised learning subproblems so that they can be efficiently solved based on graph-based label propagation. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to give an efficient solution to inter-view constraint propagation from a semi-supervised learning viewpoint. Moreover, since graph-based label propagation has been adopted for basic optimization, we develop two constrained graph construction methods for interview constraint propagation, which only differ in how the intra-view pairwise constraints are exploited. The experimental results in cross-view retrieval have shown the promising performance of our inter-view constraint propagation.

本文提出了一种基于图形的学习方法，用于多视图数据上的成对约束传播。虽然已经广泛地研究了成对约束传播，但是成对约束通常在来自单个视图的成对数据点上定义，即，对于多视图任务仅考虑视图内约束传播。事实上，很少关注视点间约束传播，这是更具挑战性的，因为成对约束现在定义在来自不同视图的数据点对上。在本文中，我们提出将具有挑战性的视点间约束传播问题分解为半监督学习子问题，以便基于图的标签传播可以有效地解决这些问题。就我们所知，这是第一次尝试从半监督的学习观点出发来有效地解决视点间的约束传播问题。此外，由于基于图的标签传播已经被用于基本的优化，因此我们针对访问约束传播开发了两种约束图构造方法，这些方法仅在视图内的成对约束被利用方面不同。在跨视图检索中的实验结果已经显示了我们的视图间约束传播的有前景的性能。
