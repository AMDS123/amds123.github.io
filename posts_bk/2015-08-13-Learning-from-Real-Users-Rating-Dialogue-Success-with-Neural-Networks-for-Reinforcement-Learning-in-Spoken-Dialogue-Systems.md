##### Abstract
To train a statistical spoken dialogue system (SDS) it is essential that an accurate method for measuring task success is available. To date training has relied on presenting a task to either simulated or paid users and inferring the dialogue's success by observing whether this presented task was achieved or not. Our aim however is to be able to learn from real users acting under their own volition, in which case it is non-trivial to rate the success as any prior knowledge of the task is simply unavailable. User feedback may be utilised but has been found to be inconsistent. Hence, here we present two neural network models that evaluate a sequence of turn-level features to rate the success of a dialogue. Importantly these models make no use of any prior knowledge of the user's task. The models are trained on dialogues generated by a simulated user and the best model is then used to train a policy on-line which is shown to perform at least as well as a baseline system using prior knowledge of the user's task. We note that the models should also be of interest for evaluating SDS and for monitoring a dialogue in rule-based SDS.

为了训练一个统计口语对话系统（SDS），必须有一个准确的方法来测量任务的成功。迄今为止，培训依赖于向模拟用户或付费用户提出任务，并通过观察是否实现了所提出的任务来推断对话的成功。然而，我们的目标是能够从真正的用户的角度学习，在这种情况下，对任务的任何先前的知识根本无法获得成功的评估是不重要的。用户反馈可能被利用，但被发现是不一致的。因此，在这里我们提出两个神经网络模型来评估一系列的转向水平特征来评估对话的成功率。重要的是，这些模型没有使用任何用户的任务的先前的知识。这些模型是由模拟用户生成的对话进行训练的，然后使用最佳模型来在线训练一个策略，该策略至少和使用用户任务的先验知识的基线系统一样。我们注意到，这些模型也应该对评估安全数据单和在基于规则的安全数据单中监测对话感兴趣。
