##### Abstract
Smooth pursuit eye movements provide meaningful insights and information on subject's behavior and health and may, in particular situations, disturb the performance of typical fixation/saccade classification algorithms. Thus, an automatic and efficient algorithm to identify these eye movements is paramount for eye-tracking research involving dynamic stimuli. In this paper, we propose the Bayesian Decision Theory Identification (I-BDT) algorithm, a novel algorithm for ternary classification of eye movements that is able to reliably separate fixations, saccades, and smooth pursuits in an online fashion, even for low-resolution eye trackers. The proposed algorithm is evaluated on four datasets with distinct mixtures of eye movements, including fixations, saccades, as well as straight and circular smooth pursuits; data was collected with a sample rate of 30 Hz from six subjects, totaling 24 evaluation datasets. The algorithm exhibits high and consistent performance across all datasets and movements relative to a manual annotation by a domain expert (recall: \mu = 91.42%, \sigma = 9.52%; precision: \mu = 95.60%, \sigma = 5.29%; specificity \mu = 95.41%, \sigma = 7.02%) and displays a significant improvement when compared to I-VDT, an state-of-the-art algorithm (recall: \mu = 87.67%, \sigma = 14.73%; precision: \mu = 89.57%, \sigma = 8.05%; specificity \mu = 92.10%, \sigma = 11.21%).

顺利追踪眼球运动提供有意义的见解和信息主体的行为和健康，并可能在特定情况下，扰乱典型的固定/扫视分类算法的表现。因此，识别这些眼球运动的自动和有效的算法对涉及动态刺激的眼动追踪研究是极为重要的。在本文中，我们提出了贝叶斯决策理论识别（I-BDT）算法，一种三维眼球运动分类算法，能够以一种在线方式可靠地分离注视，扫视和平滑的追踪，即使对于低分辨率眼睛追踪器。所提出的算法在四个数据集上进行评估，具有不同的眼动混合，包括注视，扫视以及直线和圆形平滑的追踪;数据采集​​来自6个受试者的30Hz采样率，共24个评估数据集。该算法在所有数据集和运动中表现出高度一致的性能，相对于领域专家的手工注释（回忆：\ mu = 91.42％，\ sigma = 9.52％;精度：\ mu = 95.60％，\ sigma = 5.29％; （回忆：\ mu = 87.67％，\ sigma = 14.73％;特异度\ mu = 95.41％，\ sigma = 7.02％），并显示出显着的改善：\ mu = 89.57％，\ sigma = 8.05％;特异性\ mu = 92.10％，sigma = 11.21％）。对于算法实现和注释数据集，请联系第一作者。
