##### Abstract
Microsoft Kinect camera and its skeletal tracking capabilities have been embraced by many researchers and commercial developers in various applications of real-time human movement analysis. In this paper, we evaluate the accuracy of the human kinematic motion data in the first and second generation of the Kinect system, and compare the results with an optical motion capture system. We collected motion data in 12 exercises for 10 different subjects and from three different viewpoints. We report on the accuracy of the joint localization and bone length estimation of Kinect skeletons in comparison to the motion capture. We also analyze the distribution of the joint localization offsets by fitting a mixture of Gaussian and uniform distribution models to determine the outliers in the Kinect motion data. Our analysis shows that overall Kinect 2 has more robust and more accurate tracking of human pose as compared to Kinect 1.

微软Kinect相机及其骨架跟踪功能已被许多研究人员和商业开发人员用于实时人体运动分析的各种应用中。在本文中，我们评估了第一代和第二代Kinect系统的人体运动学运动数据的精度，并将结果与​​光学运动捕捉系统进行比较。我们从十三个不同的主题和三个不同的角度收集了运动数据。我们报告的Kinect骨骼联合定位和骨骼长度估计的准确性相比，运动捕捉。我们还通过拟合高斯和均匀分布模型的混合来分析联合局部偏移的分布以确定Kinect运动数据中的异常值。我们的分析表明，与Kinect 1相比，整体Kinect 2具有更强大，更准确的人体姿态跟踪。
