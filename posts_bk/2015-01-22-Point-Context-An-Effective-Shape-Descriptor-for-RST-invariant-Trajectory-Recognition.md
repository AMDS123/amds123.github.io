##### Abstract
Motion trajectory recognition is important for characterizing the moving property of an object. The speed and accuracy of trajectory recognition rely on a compact and discriminative feature representation, and the situations of varying rotation, scaling and translation has to be specially considered. In this paper we propose a novel feature extraction method for trajectories. Firstly a trajectory is represented by a proposed point context, which is a rotation-scale-translation (RST) invariant shape descriptor with a flexible tradeoff between computational complexity and discrimination, yet we prove that it is a complete shape descriptor. Secondly, the shape context is nonlinearly mapped to a subspace by kernel nonparametric discriminant analysis (KNDA) to get a compact feature representation, and thus a trajectory is projected to a single point in a low-dimensional feature space. Experimental results show that, the proposed trajectory feature shows encouraging improvement than state-of-art methods.

运动轨迹识别对于表征物体的移动性质很重要。轨迹识别的速度和精度依赖于一个紧凑而有区别的特征表示，并且需要特别考虑旋转，缩放和平移的情况。在本文中，我们提出了一种新的轨迹特征提取方法。首先利用提出的点上下文来表示轨迹，这是一个旋转尺度 - 平移（RST）不变形状描述符，具有计算复杂度和判别度之间的灵活折衷，但是我们证明它是一个完整的形状描述符。其次，通过核非参数判别分析（KNDA）将形状上下文非线性映射到子空间，得到紧凑的特征表示，从而将轨迹投影到低维特征空间中的单个点上。实验结果表明，提出的轨迹特征比现有技术方法显示出令人鼓舞的改进。
