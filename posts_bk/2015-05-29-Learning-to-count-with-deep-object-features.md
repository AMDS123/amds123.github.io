##### Abstract
Learning to count is a learning strategy that has been recently proposed in the literature for dealing with problems where estimating the number of object instances in a scene is the final objective. In this framework, the task of learning to detect and localize individual object instances is seen as a harder task that can be evaded by casting the problem as that of computing a regression value from hand-crafted image features. In this paper we explore the features that are learned when training a counting convolutional neural network in order to understand their underlying representation. To this end we define a counting problem for MNIST data and show that the internal representation of the network is able to classify digits in spite of the fact that no direct supervision was provided for them during training. We also present preliminary results about a deep network that is able to count the number of pedestrians in a scene.

学习计数是文献中最近提出的一种学习策略，用于处理估计场景中的对象实例数量是最终目标的问题。在这个框架中，学习检测和定位单个对象实例的任务被认为是一个更难的任务，可以通过将问题从计算手工制作的图像特征的回归价值中解决出来。在本文中，我们探讨了在训练计数卷积神经网络时学习的特征，以便了解它们的基本表示。为此，我们为MNIST数据定义了一个计数问题，并且显示出网络的内部表示能够对数字进行分类，尽管在训练期间没有为他们提供直接的监督。我们还介绍了一个可以计算场景中行人数的深度网络的初步结果。
