##### Abstract
Different from face verification, face identification is much more demanding. To reach comparable performance, an identifier needs to be roughly N times better than a verifier. To expect a breakthrough in face identification, we need a fresh look at the fundamental building blocks of face recognition. In this paper we focus on the selection of a suitable signal representation and better matching strategy for face identification. We demonstrate how Gabor phase could be leveraged to improve the performance of face identification by using the Block Matching method. Compared to the existing approaches, the proposed method features much lower algorithmic complexity: face images are only filtered by a single-scale Gabor filter pair and the matching is performed between any pairs of face images at hand without involving any training process. Benchmark evaluations show that the proposed approach is totally comparable to and even better than state-of-the-art algorithms, which are typically based on more features extracted from a large set of Gabor faces and/or rely on heavy training processes.

与脸部验证不同，脸部识别要求更高。为了达到可比较的性能，标识符需要大约比验证者好N倍。为了在脸部识别方面取得突破，我们需要重新审视人脸识别的基本组成部分。在本文中，我们着重于选择合适的信号表示和更好的人脸识别匹配策略。我们演示如何利用Gabor阶段利用块匹配方法来改善人脸识别的性能。与现有方法相比，所提出的方法具有更低的算法复杂度：人脸图像仅由单尺度的Gabor滤波器对进行滤波，并且在任何一对人脸图像之间进行匹配，而不涉及任何训练过程。基准评估表明，所提出的方法完全可以与先进的算法相媲美甚至更好，这些算法通常基于从大量Gabor面提取的更多特征和/或依赖于繁重的训练过程。
