##### Abstract
We focus on the challenging problem of efficient mouse 3D pose estimation based on static images, and especially single depth images. We introduce an approach to discriminatively train the split nodes of trees in random forest to improve their performance on estimation of 3D joint positions of mouse. Our algorithm is capable of working with different types of rodents and with different types of depth cameras and imaging setups. In particular, it is demonstrated in this paper that when a top-mounted depth camera is combined with a bottom-mounted color camera, the final system is capable of delivering full-body pose estimation including four limbs and the paws. Empirical examinations on synthesized and real-world depth images confirm the applicability of our approach on mouse pose estimation, as well as the closely related task of part-based labeling of mouse.

我们专注于基于静态图像的高效鼠标3D姿态估计，特别是单个深度图像的挑战性问题。我们引入一种方法来区分地训练树的分裂节点在随机森林中，以提高它们在评估鼠标三维关节位置时的性能。我们的算法能够处理不同类型的啮齿动物以及不同类型的深度相机和成像设置。特别是在本文中，我们证明了当顶部安装的深度相机与底部安装的彩色相机相结合时，最终系统能够提供包括四肢和爪子的全身姿态估计。合成和现实世界深度图像的实证检验证实了我们的方法在鼠标姿态估计上的适用性，以及与小鼠基于部分的标记密切相关的任务。
