##### Abstract
Extraction of discriminative features from salient facial patches plays a vital role in effective facial expression recognition. The accurate detection of facial landmarks improves the localization of the salient patches on face images. This paper proposes a novel framework for expression recognition by using appearance features of selected facial patches. A few prominent facial patches, depending on the position of facial landmarks, are extracted which are active during emotion elicitation. These active patches are further processed to obtain the salient patches which contain discriminative features for classification of each pair of expressions, thereby selecting different facial patches as salient for different pair of expression classes. One-against-one classification method is adopted using these features. In addition, an automated learning-free facial landmark detection technique has been proposed, which achieves similar performances as that of other state-of-art landmark detection methods, yet requires significantly less execution time. The proposed method is found to perform well consistently in different resolutions, hence, providing a solution for expression recognition in low resolution images. Experiments on CK+ and JAFFE facial expression databases show the effectiveness of the proposed system.

从显着的面部贴片中提取判别性特征在有效的面部表情识别中起着至关重要的作用。精确的面部标志检测改善了人脸图像中显着斑块的定位。本文提出了一种新颖的面部表情识别框架，根据面部标志的位置，提取一些显着的面部斑块，其在情感启发期间是活跃的。进一步处理这些活动斑块以获得含有用于每对表情分类的判别特征的显着斑点，从而选择不同的面部斑点作为针对不同表达类别的显着特征。采用一对一的分类方法，使用这些特征。此外，还提出了一种自动免学习的面部标志检测技术，其性能与其他先进的标志检测方法相似，但执行时间明显较少。发现所提出的方法在不同分辨率下表现良好，因此为低分辨率图像中的表达识别提供了解决方案。 CK +和JAFFE表情数据库的实验表明了该系统的有效性。
