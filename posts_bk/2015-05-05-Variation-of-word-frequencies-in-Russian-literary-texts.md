##### Abstract
We study the variation of word frequencies in Russian literary texts. Our findings indicate that the standard deviation of a word's frequency across texts depends on its average frequency according to a power law with exponent $0.62,$ showing that the rarer words have a relatively larger degree of frequency volatility (i.e., "burstiness"). Several latent factors models have been estimated to investigate the structure of the word frequency distribution. The dependence of a word's frequency volatility on its average frequency can be explained by the asymmetry in the distribution of latent factors.

我们研究俄语文学文本中词频的变化。我们的研究结果表明，一个单词文本频率的标准差取决于它的平均频率，根据幂指数$ 0.62表示罕见单词具有相对较大的频率波动度（即“突发性”）。已经估计了几个潜在因素模型来研究词频分布的结构。一个字的频率波动对其平均频率的依赖可以用潜在因素分布的不对称来解释。
