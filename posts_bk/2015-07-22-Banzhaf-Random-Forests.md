##### Abstract
Random forests are a type of ensemble method which makes predictions by combining the results of several independent trees. However, the theory of random forests has long been outpaced by their application. In this paper, we propose a novel random forests algorithm based on cooperative game theory. Banzhaf power index is employed to evaluate the power of each feature by traversing possible feature coalitions. Unlike the previously used information gain rate of information theory, which simply chooses the most informative feature, the Banzhaf power index can be considered as a metric of the importance of each feature on the dependency among a group of features. More importantly, we have proved the consistency of the proposed algorithm, named Banzhaf random forests (BRF). This theoretical analysis takes a step towards narrowing the gap between the theory and practice of random forests for classification problems. Experiments on several UCI benchmark data sets show that BRF is competitive with state-of-the-art classifiers and dramatically outperforms previous consistent random forests. Particularly, it is much more efficient than previous consistent random forests.

随机森林是一种通过结合几个独立树的结果进行预测的集合方法。然而，随机森林的理论早已被其应用所取代。在本文中，我们提出了一种基于合作博弈理论的新型随机森林算法。 Banzhaf幂指数用于通过遍历可能的特征联盟来评估每个特征的功率。与以前使用的信息理论的信息增益率不同，后者简单地选择信息最丰富的特征，Banzhaf幂指数可以被认为是每个特征对一组特征之间依赖关系重要性的度量。更重要的是，我们证明了所提算法Banzhaf随机森林（BRF）的一致性。这一理论分析为缩小随机森林分类问题的理论与实践之间的差距迈出了一步。在几个UCI基准数据集上进行的实验表明，BRF与最先进的分类器相比具有竞争力，并且大大优于先前一致的随机森林。特别是，它比以前一致的随机森林更有效率。
