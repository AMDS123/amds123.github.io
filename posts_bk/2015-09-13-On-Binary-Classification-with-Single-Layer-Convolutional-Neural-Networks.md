##### Abstract
Convolutional neural networks are becoming standard tools for solving object recognition and visual tasks. However, most of the design and implementation of these complex models are based on trail-and-error. In this report, the main focus is to consider some of the important factors in designing convolutional networks to perform better. Specifically, classification with wide single-layer networks with large kernels as a general framework is considered. Particularly, we will show that pre-training using unsupervised schemes is vital, reasonable regularization is beneficial and applying of strong regularizers like dropout could be devastating. Pool size is also could be as important as learning procedure itself. In addition, it has been presented that using such a simple and relatively fast model for classifying cats and dogs, performance is close to state-of-the-art achievable by a combination of SVM models on color and texture features.

卷积神经网络正在成为解决物体识别和视觉任务的标准工具。但是，这些复杂模型的大部分设计和实现都是基于追踪和错误的。在这份报告中，重点是考虑一些在设计卷积网络方面表现更好的重要因素。具体而言，考虑将具有大内核的宽单层网络分类为通用框架。特别是，我们将展示使用无监督方案的预训练是至关重要的，合理的正规化是有益的，并且像辍学这样的强大的正规化者的应用可能是毁灭性的。游泳池的大小也可能与学习过程本身一样重要。另外，已经提出使用这种简单且相对较快的猫狗分类模型，通过在颜色和纹理特征上结合SVM模型，性能接近于可实现的最新水平。
