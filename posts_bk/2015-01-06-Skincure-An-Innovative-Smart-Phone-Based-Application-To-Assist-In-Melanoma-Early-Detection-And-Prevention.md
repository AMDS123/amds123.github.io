##### Abstract
Melanoma spreads through metastasis, and therefore it has been proven to be very fatal. Statistical evidence has revealed that the majority of deaths resulting from skin cancer are as a result of melanoma. Further investigations have shown that the survival rates in patients depend on the stage of the infection; early detection and intervention of melanoma implicates higher chances of cure. Clinical diagnosis and prognosis of melanoma is challenging since the processes are prone to misdiagnosis and inaccuracies due to doctors subjectivity. This paper proposes an innovative and fully functional smart-phone based application to assist in melanoma early detection and prevention. The application has two major components; the first component is a real-time alert to help users prevent skin burn caused by sunlight; a novel equation to compute the time for skin to burn is thereby introduced. The second component is an automated image analysis module which contains image acquisition, hair detection and exclusion, lesion segmentation, feature extraction, and classification. The proposed system exploits PH2 Dermoscopy image database from Pedro Hispano Hospital for development and testing purposes. The image database contains a total of 200 dermoscopy images of lesions, including normal, atypical, and melanoma cases. The experimental results show that the proposed system is efficient, achieving classification of the normal, atypical and melanoma images with accuracy of 96.3%, 95.7% and 97.5%, respectively.

黑色素瘤通过转移扩散，因此已被证明是非常致命的。统计证据显示，皮肤癌导致的大部分死亡是黑色素瘤的结果。进一步的调查显示，患者的生存率取决于感染的阶段;早期发现和干预黑色素瘤意味着更高的治愈机会。黑色素瘤的临床诊断和预后具有挑战性，因为由于医生的主观性，这些过程易于误诊和不准确。本文提出了一种创新的功能齐全的基于智能手机的应用，以协助黑色素瘤的早期发现和预防。该应用程序有两个主要组件;第一个组件是实时警报，帮助用户防止日光导致的皮肤烧伤;由此引入计算皮肤燃烧时间的新方程。第二部分是一个自动图像分析模块，包含图像采集，头发检测和排除，病灶分割，特征提取和分类。所提出的系统利用来自Pedro Hispano Hospital的PH2 Dermoscopy图像数据库用于开发和测试目的。图像数据库共包含200例皮肤病变影像，包括正常，非典型和黑色素瘤病例。实验结果表明，所提出的系统是有效的，实现正常，非典型和黑色素瘤图像的准确率分别为96.3％，95.7％和97.5％的分类。
