##### Abstract
We present a novel means of describing local image appearances using binary strings. Binary descriptors have drawn increasing interest in recent years due to their speed and low memory footprint. A known shortcoming of these representations is their inferior performance compared to larger, histogram based descriptors such as the SIFT. Our goal is to close this performance gap while maintaining the benefits attributed to binary representations. To this end we propose the Learned Arrangements of Three Patch Codes descriptors, or LATCH. Our key observation is that existing binary descriptors are at an increased risk from noise and local appearance variations. This, as they compare the values of pixel pairs; changes to either of the pixels can easily lead to changes in descriptor values, hence damaging its performance. In order to provide more robustness, we instead propose a novel means of comparing pixel patches. This ostensibly small change, requires a substantial redesign of the descriptors themselves and how they are produced. Our resulting LATCH representation is rigorously compared to state-of-the-art binary descriptors and shown to provide far better performance for similar computation and space requirements.

我们提出了一种使用二进制字符串来描述本地图像外观的新方法。由于二进制描述符的速度和低内存占用，近年来引起了越来越多的兴趣。这些表示法的一个已知缺点是与较大的基于直方图的描述符（如SIFT）相比，它们的性能较差。我们的目标是缩小这个性能差距，同时保持二进制表示的优势。为此，我们提出了三个补丁码描述符或LATCH的学习安排。我们的关键观察是现有的二进制描述符由于噪声和局部外观变化而增加了风险。这是因为他们比较像素对的值;任何一个像素的改变都会很容易导致描述符值的改变，从而损害其性能。为了提供更好的鲁棒性，我们提出了一种比较像素块的新方法。这种表面上小的变化，需要对描述符本身进行重新设计以及如何生成。我们得到的LATCH表示法与最先进的二进制描述符进行了严格的比较，并且表现出对类似的计算和空间要求更好的性能。
