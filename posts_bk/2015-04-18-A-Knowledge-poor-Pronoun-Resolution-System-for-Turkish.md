##### Abstract
A pronoun resolution system which requires limited syntactic knowledge to identify the antecedents of personal and reflexive pronouns in Turkish is presented. As in its counterparts for languages like English, Spanish and French, the core of the system is the constraints and preferences determined empirically. In the evaluation phase, it performed considerably better than the baseline algorithm used for comparison. The system is significant for its being the first fully specified knowledge-poor computational framework for pronoun resolution in Turkish where Turkish possesses different structural properties from the languages for which knowledge-poor systems had been developed.

提出了一个代词解析系统，它需要有限的句法知识来识别土耳其语中个人和反身代词的前因。和英语，西班牙语和法语这样的语言的同行一样，该系统的核心是经验确定的约束和偏好。在评估阶段，它比用于比较的基准算法表现得好得多。该系统对土耳其语来说是第一个完全指定的知识贫乏的代词解析计算框架，其中土耳其语拥有与开发知识贫乏的系统的语言不同的结构特性。
