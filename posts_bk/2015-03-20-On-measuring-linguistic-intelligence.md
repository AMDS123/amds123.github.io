##### Abstract
This work addresses the problem of measuring how many languages a person "effectively" speaks given that some of the languages are close to each other. In other words, to assign a meaningful number to her language portfolio. Intuition says that someone who speaks fluently Spanish and Portuguese is linguistically less proficient compared to someone who speaks fluently Spanish and Chinese since it takes more effort for a native Spanish speaker to learn Chinese than Portuguese. As the number of languages grows and their proficiency levels vary, it gets even more complicated to assign a score to a language portfolio. In this article we propose such a measure ("linguistic quotient" - LQ) that can account for these effects. We define the properties that such a measure should have. They are based on the idea of coherent risk measures from the mathematical finance. Having laid down the foundation, we propose one such a measure together with the algorithm that works on languages classification tree as input. The algorithm together with the input is available online at lingvometer.com

这项工作解决了衡量一个人“有效”说多少种语言的问题，因为有些语言彼此接近。换句话说，为她的语言组合分配一个有意义的数字。直觉说，一个说西班牙语和葡萄牙语流利的人，与西班牙语和中文流利的人相比，在语言上不太熟练，因为西班牙语母语人士要学习中文而不是葡萄牙语。随着语言数量的增长和熟练程度的变化，为语言组合分配一个分数变得更加复杂。在这篇文章中，我们提出了一个可以解释这些影响的措施（“语言商” -  LQ）。我们定义这种措施应该具有的属性。它们是基于数学金融的一致风险度量的思想。在奠定了基础的基础上，我们提出了一个这样的措施，与在语言分类树上工作的算法一起作为输入。该算法与输入一起在线可在lingvometer.com上获得
