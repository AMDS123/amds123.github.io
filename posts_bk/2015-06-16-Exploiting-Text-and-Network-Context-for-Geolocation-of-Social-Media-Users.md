##### Abstract
Research on automatically geolocating social media users has conventionally been based on the text content of posts from a given user or the social network of the user, with very little crossover between the two, and no bench-marking of the two approaches over compara- ble datasets. We bring the two threads of research together in first proposing a text-based method based on adaptive grids, followed by a hybrid network- and text-based method. Evaluating over three Twitter datasets, we show that the empirical difference between text- and network-based methods is not great, and that hybridisation of the two is superior to the component methods, especially in contexts where the user graph is not well connected. We achieve state-of-the-art results on all three datasets.

对社交媒体用户进行自动地理定位的研究通常基于来自给定用户或用户的社交网络的帖子的文本内容，两者之间的交叉很少，并且两种方法都没有比较可比的标准数据集。我们将两个研究主题结合在一起，首先提出一种基于自适应网格的基于文本的方法，其次是基于混合网络和文本的方法。评估三个Twitter数据集，我们表明，基于文本和网络的方法之间的经验差异不是很大，并且这两者的混合优于组件方法，尤其是在用户图形没有良好连接的情况下。我们在所有三个数据集上实现了最先进的结果。
