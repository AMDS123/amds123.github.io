##### Abstract
Fractal image compression has some desirable properties like high quality at high compression ratio, fast decoding, and resolution independence. Therefore it can be used for many applications such as texture mapping and pattern recognition and image watermarking. But it suffers from long encoding time due to its need to find the best match between sub blocks. This time is related to the approach that is used. In this paper we present a fast encoding Algorithm based on no search method. Our goal is that more blocks are covered in initial step of quad tree algorithm. Experimental result has been compared with other new fast fractal coding methods, showing it is better in term of bit rate in same condition while the other parameters are fixed.

分形图像压缩具有一些理想的特性，例如高压缩比的高质量，快速解码和分辨率独立性。因此可以用于纹理映射，模式识别，图像水印等多种应用。但由于需要找到子块​​之间的最佳匹配，所以它遭受了很长的编码时间。这一次与使用的方法有关。本文提出了一种基于无搜索方法的快速编码算法。我们的目标是在四叉树算法的初始步骤中覆盖更多的块。实验结果与其他新的快速分形编码方法进行了比较，表明在相同条件下比特率更好，其他参数固定。
