##### Abstract
Recently, the focus of complex networks research has shifted from the analysis of isolated properties of a system toward a more realistic modeling of multiple phenomena - multilayer networks. Motivated by the prosperity of multilayer approach in social, transport or trade systems, we propose the introduction of multilayer networks for language. The multilayer network of language is a unified framework for modeling linguistic subsystems and their structural properties enabling the exploration of their mutual interactions. Various aspects of natural language systems can be represented as complex networks, whose vertices depict linguistic units, while links model their relations. The multilayer network of language is defined by three aspects: the network construction principle, the linguistic subsystem and the language of interest. More precisely, we construct a word-level (syntax, co-occurrence and its shuffled counterpart) and a subword level (syllables and graphemes) network layers, from five variations of original text (in the modeled language). The obtained results suggest that there are substantial differences between the networks structures of different language subsystems, which are hidden during the exploration of an isolated layer. The word-level layers share structural properties regardless of the language (e.g. Croatian or English), while the syllabic subword level expresses more language dependent structural properties. The preserved weighted overlap quantifies the similarity of word-level layers in weighted and directed networks. Moreover, the analysis of motifs reveals a close topological structure of the syntactic and syllabic layers for both languages. The findings corroborate that the multilayer network framework is a powerful, consistent and systematic approach to model several linguistic subsystems simultaneously and hence to provide a more unified view on language.

最近，复杂网络研究的重点已经从一个系统的孤立属性的分析转移到多个现象 - 多层网络的更现实的建模。受到社会，交通或贸易体系中多层次方法的繁荣的启发，我们建议引入语言多层网络。语言的多层网络是对语言子系统及其结构特性进行建模的统一框架，能够探索其相互作用。自然语言系统的各个方面可以表示为复杂的网络，其顶点描绘语言单位，而链接建模其关系。语言的多层网络由网络建构原则，语言子系统和兴趣语言三个方面来定义。更确切地说，我们从原始文本的五种变体（以模型化语言）构造了一个词层次（语法，共现和混洗的对应物）和一个子词层次（音节和字素）网络层。得到的结果表明，不同语言子系统的网络结构在探索孤立层时隐藏着很大的差异。单词层次不论语言（例如克罗地亚语还是英语），都共享结构属性，而音节子字级表示更多与语言相关的结构属性。保存的加权重叠量化了加权网络和有向网络中词层次的相似度。此外，对主题的分析揭示了两种语言的句法和音节层的紧密的拓扑结构。这些发现证实，多层网络框架是一个强大的，一致的，系统的方法，可以同时为几个语言子系统建模，从而提供一个更统一的语言视图。
