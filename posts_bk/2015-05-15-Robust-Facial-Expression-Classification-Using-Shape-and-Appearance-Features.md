##### Abstract
Facial expression recognition has many potential applications which has attracted the attention of researchers in the last decade. Feature extraction is one important step in expression analysis which contributes toward fast and accurate expression recognition. This paper represents an approach of combining the shape and appearance features to form a hybrid feature vector. We have extracted Pyramid of Histogram of Gradients (PHOG) as shape descriptors and Local Binary Patterns (LBP) as appearance features. The proposed framework involves a novel approach of extracting hybrid features from active facial patches. The active facial patches are located on the face regions which undergo a major change during different expressions. After detection of facial landmarks, the active patches are localized and hybrid features are calculated from these patches. The use of small parts of face instead of the whole face for extracting features reduces the computational cost and prevents the over-fitting of the features for classification. By using linear discriminant analysis, the dimensionality of the feature is reduced which is further classified by using the support vector machine (SVM). The experimental results on two publicly available databases show promising accuracy in recognizing all expression classes.

面部表情识别具有很多潜在的应用，在过去的十年中引起了研究者的关注。特征提取是表达分析中的一个重要步骤，有助于快速和准确的表达识别。本文提出了一种将形状和外观特征相结合形成混合特征向量的方法。我们已经提取梯度直方图（PHOG）的金字塔形状描述符和局部二值模式（LBP）作为外观特征。所提出的框架涉及从活动面部贴片提取混合特征的新颖方法。活动的面部贴片位于在不同表情中经历重大改变的面部区域。在检测到面部标志之后，活动斑块被定位，并且从这些斑块计算混合特征。使用小部分脸部而不是整个脸部来提取特征减少了计算成本，并且防止了特征的过度拟合来进行分类。通过线性判别分析，降低了特征的维数，并利用支持向量机（SVM）进一步分类。在两个公开可用的数据库上的实验结果显示了在识别所有表达类别方面有前途的准确性
