##### Abstract
In the past few years, the number of fine-art collections that are digitized and publicly available has been growing rapidly. With the availability of such large collections of digitized artworks comes the need to develop multimedia systems to archive and retrieve this pool of data. Measuring the visual similarity between artistic items is an essential step for such multimedia systems, which can benefit more high-level multimedia tasks. In order to model this similarity between paintings, we should extract the appropriate visual features for paintings and find out the best approach to learn the similarity metric based on these features. We investigate a comprehensive list of visual features and metric learning approaches to learn an optimized similarity measure between paintings. We develop a machine that is able to make aesthetic-related semantic-level judgments, such as predicting a painting's style, genre, and artist, as well as providing similarity measures optimized based on the knowledge available in the domain of art historical interpretation. Our experiments show the value of using this similarity measure for the aforementioned prediction tasks.

在过去的几年中，数字化和公开的美术收藏数量迅速增长。随着这些大量的数字化艺术作品的出现，需要开发多媒体系统来归档和检索这个数据库。测量艺术品之间的视觉相似度是这种多媒体系统的一个重要步骤，它可以使更多的高级多媒体任务受益。为了模拟绘画之间的相似性，我们应该为绘画提取适当的视觉特征，并找出基于这些特征来学习相似性度量的最佳方法。我们调查了视觉特征和度量学习方法的全面列表，以学习绘画之间的优化相似性度量。我们开发一种能够进行与审美有关的语义层面的判断的机器，例如预测绘画的风格，流派和艺术家，以及根据艺术史解释领域中可用的知识提供最优化的相似性度量。我们的实验显示了使用这种相似性度量的前述预测任务的价值。
