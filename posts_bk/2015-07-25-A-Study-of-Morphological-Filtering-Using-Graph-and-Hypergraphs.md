##### Abstract
Mathematical morphology (MM) helps to describe and analyze shapes using set theory. MM can be effectively applied to binary images which are treated as sets. Basic morphological operators defined can be used as an effective tool in image processing. Morphological operators are also developed based on graph and hypergraph. These operators have found better performance and applications in image processing. Bino et al. [8], [9] developed the theory of morphological operators on hypergraph. A hypergraph structure is considered and basic morphological operation erosion/dilation is defined. Several new operators opening/closing and filtering are also defined on the hypergraphs. Hypergraph based filtering have found comparatively better performance with morphological filters based on graph. In this paper we evaluate the effectiveness of hypergraph based ASF on binary images. Experimental results shows that hypergraph based ASF filters have outperformed graph based ASF.

数学形态学（MM）有助于使用集合论来描述和分析形状。 MM可以有效地应用于被视为集合的二值图像。定义的基本形态学算子可以作为图像处理的有效工具。形态学算子也是基于图和超图开发的。这些操作员在图像处理中找到了更好的性能和应用。 Bino等人[8]，[9]开发了超图的形态算子理论。超图结构被认为是基本的形态学操作侵蚀/膨胀的定义。在超图上还定义了几个新的操作符开/关和过滤。基于图的形态滤波器基于超图的滤波已经找到了比较好的性能。在本文中，我们评估基于超图的ASF在二值图像上的有效性。实验结果表明，基于超图的ASF滤波器的性能优于基于图的ASF。
