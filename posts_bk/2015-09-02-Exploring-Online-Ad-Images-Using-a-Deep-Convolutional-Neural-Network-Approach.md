##### Abstract
Online advertising is a huge, rapidly growing advertising market in today's world. One common form of online advertising is using image ads. A decision is made (often in real time) every time a user sees an ad, and the advertiser is eager to determine the best ad to display. Consequently, many algorithms have been developed that calculate the optimal ad to show to the current user at the present time. Typically, these algorithms focus on variations of the ad, optimizing among different properties such as background color, image size, or set of images. However, there is a more fundamental layer. Our study looks at new qualities of ads that can be determined before an ad is shown (rather than online optimization) and defines which ads are most likely to be successful. We present a set of novel algorithms that utilize deep-learning image processing, machine learning, and graph theory to investigate online advertising and to construct prediction models which can foresee an image ad's success. We evaluated our algorithms on a dataset with over 260,000 ad images, as well as a smaller dataset specifically related to the automotive industry, and we succeeded in constructing regression models for ad image click rate prediction. The obtained results emphasize the great potential of using deep-learning algorithms to effectively and efficiently analyze image ads and to create better and more innovative online ads. Moreover, the algorithms presented in this paper can help predict ad success and can be applied to analyze other large-scale image corpora.

在线广告是当今世界巨大，快速增长的广告市场。在线广告的一种常见形式是使用图像广告。每当用户看到广告时都会做出决定（通常是实时的），而广告客户则渴望确定要显示的最佳广告。因此，已经开发了许多算法来计算当前向当前用户显示的最佳广告。通常，这些算法关注广告的变体，优化不同的属性，如背景颜色，图像大小或一组图像。但是，还有一个更基础的层面。我们的研究着眼于在展示广告（而不是在线优化）之前可以确定的新广告质量，并确定哪些广告最有可能取得成功。我们提出了一套新的算法​​，利用深度学习图像处理，机器学习和图论来调查在线广告，并构建可预见图像广告成功的预测模型。我们在包含超过26万个广告图像的数据集以及与汽车行业相关的较小数据集上评估了我们的算法，并成功构建了广告图像点击率预测的回归模型。所获得的结果强调了使用深度学习算法来有效和高效地分析图像广告以及创建更好和更具创新性的在线广告的巨大潜力。此外，本文提出的算法可以帮助预测广告成功，并可用于分析其他大规模图像语料库。
