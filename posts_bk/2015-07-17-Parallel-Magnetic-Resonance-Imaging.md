##### Abstract
The main disadvantage of Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) are its long scan times and, in consequence, its sensitivity to motion. Exploiting the complementary information from multiple receive coils, parallel imaging is able to recover images from under-sampled k-space data and to accelerate the measurement. Because parallel magnetic resonance imaging can be used to accelerate basically any imaging sequence it has many important applications. Parallel imaging brought a fundamental shift in image reconstruction: Image reconstruction changed from a simple direct Fourier transform to the solution of an ill-conditioned inverse problem. This work gives an overview of image reconstruction from the perspective of inverse problems. After introducing basic concepts such as regularization, discretization, and iterative reconstruction, advanced topics are discussed including algorithms for auto-calibration, the connection to approximation theory, and the combination with compressed sensing.

##### Abstract (translated by Google)
磁共振成像（MRI）的主要缺点是扫描时间长，因此对运动敏感。利用来自多个接收线圈的互补信息，并行成像能够从欠采样的k空间数据恢复图像并加速测量。由于平行磁共振成像可以用于基本上加速任何成像序列，所以它具有许多重要的应用。并行成像引起了图像重建的根本性转变：图像重建由简单的直接傅立叶变换转变为病态逆问题的解决方案。本文从反问题的角度对图像重构进行了概述。在介绍了正则化，离散化和迭代重构等基本概念之后，讨论了高级主题，包括自动校准算法，与逼近理论的联系以及与压缩感知的结合。
