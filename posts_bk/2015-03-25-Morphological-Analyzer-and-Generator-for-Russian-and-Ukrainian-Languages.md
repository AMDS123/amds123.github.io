##### Abstract
pymorphy2 is a morphological analyzer and generator for Russian and Ukrainian languages. It uses large efficiently encoded lexi- cons built from OpenCorpora and LanguageTool data. A set of linguistically motivated rules is developed to enable morphological analysis and generation of out-of-vocabulary words observed in real-world documents. For Russian pymorphy2 provides state-of-the-arts morphological analysis quality. The analyzer is implemented in Python programming language with optional C++ extensions. Emphasis is put on ease of use, documentation and extensibility. The package is distributed under a permissive open-source license, encouraging its use in both academic and commercial setting.
