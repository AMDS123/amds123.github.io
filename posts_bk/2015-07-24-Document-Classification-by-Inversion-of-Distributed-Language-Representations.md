##### Abstract
There have been many recent advances in the structure and measurement of distributed language models: those that map from words to a vector-space that is rich in information about word choice and composition. This vector-space is the distributed language representation. The goal of this note is to point out that any distributed representation can be turned into a classifier through inversion via Bayes rule. The approach is simple and modular, in that it will work with any language representation whose training can be formulated as optimizing a probability model. In our application to 2 million sentences from Yelp reviews, we also find that it performs as well as or better than complex purpose-built algorithms.

在分布式语言模型的结构和测量方面有许多新的进展：那些从单词到矢量空间的映射，这些空间丰富的关于单词选择和构成的信息。这个向量空间是分布式的语言表示。这个笔记的目的是指出任何分布式表示可以通过贝叶斯规则反演变成一个分类器。该方法简单且模块化，因为它可以与任何语言表示一起工作，其训练可以被制定为优化概率模型。在我们对Yelp评论的200万个句子的应用中，我们也发现它和复杂的特定目标算法一样好，甚至更好。
