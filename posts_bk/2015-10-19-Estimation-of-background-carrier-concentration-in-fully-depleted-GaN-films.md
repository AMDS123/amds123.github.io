##### Abstract
Buffer leakage is an important parasitic loss mechanism in AlGaN/GaN HEMTs and hence various methods are employed to grow semi-insulating buffer layers. Quantification of carrier concentration in such buffers using conventional capacitance based profiling techniques is challenging due to their fully depleted nature even at zero bias voltages. We provide a simple and effective model to extract carrier concentrations in fully depleted GaN films using capacitance-voltage (C-V) measurements. Extensive mercury probe C-V profiling has been performed on GaN films of differing thicknesses and doping levels in order to validate this model. Carrier concentrations as extracted from both the conventional C-V technique for partially depleted films having the same doping concentration, and Hall measurements show excellent agreement with those predicted by the proposed model thus establishing the utility of this technique. This model can be readily extended to estimate background carrier concentrations from the depletion region capacitances of HEMT structures and fully depleted films of any class of semiconductor materials.

缓冲泄漏是AlGaN / GaN HEMT中重要的寄生损失机制，因此采用各种方法来生长半绝缘缓冲层。使用常规的基于电容的分析技术对这种缓冲液中的载流子浓度进行量化是具有挑战性的，因为它们即使在零偏置电压下也完全耗尽。我们提供了一个简单而有效的模型来提取电容电压（C-V）测量完全耗尽GaN薄膜中的载流子浓度。为了验证这个模型，已经在不同厚度和掺杂水平的GaN膜上进行了广泛的水银探针C-V分析。从常规C-V技术中提取的载流子浓度对于具有相同掺杂浓度的部分耗尽的薄膜以及霍尔测量结果显示与所提出的模型预测的一致，从而确立了该技术的实用性。可以容易地扩展该模型以估计来自HEMT结构的耗尽区电容和任何类别的半导体材料的完全耗尽的膜的背景载流子浓度。
