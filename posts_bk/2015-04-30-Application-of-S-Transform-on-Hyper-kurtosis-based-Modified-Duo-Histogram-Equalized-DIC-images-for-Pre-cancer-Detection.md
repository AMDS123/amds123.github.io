##### Abstract
Our proposed hyper kurtosis based histogram equalized DIC images enhances the contrast by preserving the brightness. The evolution and development of precancerous activity among tissues are studied through S-transform (ST). The significant variations of amplitude spectra can be observed due to increased medium roughness from normal tissue were observed in time-frequency domain. The randomness and inhomogeneity of the tissue structures among human normal and different grades of DIC tissues is recognized by ST based timefrequency analysis. This study offers a simpler and better way to recognize the substantial changes among different stages of DIC tissues, which are reflected by spatial information containing within the inhomogeneity structures of different types of tissue.

我们提出的基于超峰度的直方图均衡DIC图像通过保持亮度来增强对比度。通过S变换（ST）研究组织中癌前病变活动的进展与发展。由于在时频域观察到正常组织中粗糙度的增加，可以观察到幅度谱的显着变化。基于ST的时频分析识别人正常和不同等级DIC组织的组织结构的随机性和不均匀性。这项研究提供了一个更简单，更好的方式来识别DIC组织的不同阶段之间的实质性变化，这是由不同类型组织的不均匀结构内的空间信息反映。
