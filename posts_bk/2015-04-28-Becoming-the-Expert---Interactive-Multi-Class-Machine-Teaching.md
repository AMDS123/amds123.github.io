##### Abstract
Compared to machines, humans are extremely good at classifying images into categories, especially when they possess prior knowledge of the categories at hand. If this prior information is not available, supervision in the form of teaching images is required. To learn categories more quickly, people should see important and representative images first, followed by less important images later - or not at all. However, image-importance is individual-specific, i.e. a teaching image is important to a student if it changes their overall ability to discriminate between classes. Further, students keep learning, so while image-importance depends on their current knowledge, it also varies with time. In this work we propose an Interactive Machine Teaching algorithm that enables a computer to teach challenging visual concepts to a human. Our adaptive algorithm chooses, online, which labeled images from a teaching set should be shown to the student as they learn. We show that a teaching strategy that probabilistically models the student's ability and progress, based on their correct and incorrect answers, produces better 'experts'. We present results using real human participants across several varied and challenging real-world datasets.

与机器相比，人类非常善于将图像分类，尤其是当他们掌握了类别的先前知识。如果没有这些先前的信息，则需要以教学图像的形式进行监督。要更快速地学习类别，人们应该首先看到重要的和具有代表性的图像，然后再看到不太重要的图像，或者根本没有。然而，形象重要性是个体特定的，即如果教学形象改变了他们区分课堂的整体能力，则教学形象对于学生是重要的。此外，学生不断学习，所以虽然形象重要性取决于他们现有的知识，但也随时间变化。在这项工作中，我们提出了一个交互式机器教学算法，使计算机能够向人类传授具有挑战性的视觉概念。我们的自适应算法可以在线选择从教学集中标记的图像，并在学习时向学生展示。我们表明，根据他们的正确和不正确的答案，概率地模拟学生的能力和进步的教学策略产生更好的“专家”。我们使用真实的人类参与者在多个不同和具有挑战性的现实世界数据集中呈现结果
