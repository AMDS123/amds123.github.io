##### Abstract
Traditional approaches for handwritten Chinese character recognition suffer in classifying similar characters. In this paper, we propose to discriminate similar handwritten Chinese characters by using weakly supervised learning. Our approach learns a discriminative SVM for each similar pair which simultaneously localizes the discriminative region of similar character and makes the classification. For the first time, similar handwritten Chinese character recognition (SHCCR) is formulated as an optimization problem extended from SVM. We also propose a novel feature descriptor, Gradient Context, and apply bag-of-words model to represent regions with different scales. In our method, we do not need to select a sized-fixed sub-window to differentiate similar characters. The unconstrained property makes our method well adapted to high variance in the size and position of discriminative regions in similar handwritten Chinese characters. We evaluate our proposed approach over the CASIA Chinese character data set and the results show that our method outperforms the state of the art.

传统的手写汉字识别方法在分类相似的字符时遇到困难。在本文中，我们提出使用弱监督学习来区分类似的手写汉字。我们的方法学习每个类似对的区分支持向量机，同时定位相似字符的区分区域并进行分类。首次将相似的手写体汉字识别（SHCCR）表述为支持向量机（SVM）的一个优化问题。我们还提出了一种新颖的特征描述符Gradient Context，并应用bag-of-words模型来表示不同尺度的区域。在我们的方法中，我们不需要选择大小固定的子窗口来区分相似的字符。无约束性使得我们的方法很好地适应了类似手写汉字中判别区域的大小和位置的高度变化。我们评估我们对CASIA汉字数据集提出的方法，结果表明我们的方法胜过了现有技术。
