##### Abstract
Video processing systems such as HEVC requiring low energy consumption needed for the multimedia market has lead to extensive development in fast algorithms for the efficient approximation of 2-D DCT transforms. The DCT is employed in a multitude of compression standards due to its remarkable energy compaction properties. Multiplier-free approximate DCT transforms have been proposed that offer superior compression performance at very low circuit complexity. Such approximations can be realized in digital VLSI hardware using additions and subtractions only, leading to significant reductions in chip area and power consumption compared to conventional DCTs and integer transforms. In this paper, we introduce a novel 8-point DCT approximation that requires only 14 addition operations and no multiplications. The proposed transform possesses low computational complexity and is compared to state-of-the-art DCT approximations in terms of both algorithm complexity and peak signal-to-noise ratio. The proposed DCT approximation is a candidate for reconfigurable video standards such as HEVC. The proposed transform and several other DCT approximations are mapped to systolic-array digital architectures and physically realized as digital prototype circuits using FPGA technology and mapped to 45 nm CMOS technology.

需要多媒体市场所需的低能量消耗的视频处理系统（例如HEVC）已导致快速算法中的广泛发展，用于有效逼近2D DCT变换。 DCT由于其卓越的能量压缩特性而被用于多种压缩标准中。已经提出了无乘法器的近似DCT变换，其在非常低的电路复杂度下提供优异的压缩性能。这种近似可以在数字VLSI硬件中仅使用加法和减法来实现，与传统的DCT和整数变换相比，导致芯片面积和功耗的显着减少。在本文中，我们介绍一种新的8点DCT逼近，只需要14个加法运算，不需要乘法运算。所提出的变换具有低的计算复杂度，并且在算法复杂度和峰值信噪比方面与最先进的DCT近似进行比较。所提出的DCT近似是诸如HEVC的可重配置视频标准的候选者。所提出的变换和几个其他DCT近似值映射到收缩阵列数字体系结构，并物理实现为使用FPGA技术的数字原型电路，并映射到45 nm CMOS技术。
