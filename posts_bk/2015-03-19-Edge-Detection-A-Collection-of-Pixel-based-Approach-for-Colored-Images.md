##### Abstract
The existing traditional edge detection algorithms process a single pixel on an image at a time, thereby calculating a value which shows the edge magnitude of the pixel and the edge orientation. Most of these existing algorithms convert the coloured images into gray scale before detection of edges. However, this process leads to inaccurate precision of recognized edges, thus producing false and broken edges in the image. This paper presents a profile modelling scheme for collection of pixels based on the step and ramp edges, with a view to reducing the false and broken edges present in the image. The collection of pixel scheme generated is used with the Vector Order Statistics to reduce the imprecision of recognized edges when converting from coloured to gray scale images. The Pratt Figure of Merit (PFOM) is used as a quantitative comparison between the existing traditional edge detection algorithm and the developed algorithm as a means of validation. The PFOM value obtained for the developed algorithm is 0.8480, which showed an improvement over the existing traditional edge detection algorithms.

现有的传统的边缘检测算法一次对图像上的单个像素进行处理，从而计算出表示像素的边缘量值和边缘方向的值。这些现有的算法大部分在检测边缘之前将彩色图像转换成灰度。但是，这个过程会导致识别边缘的精确度不准确，从而在图像中产生假的和破损的边缘。本文提出了一种基于阶跃和斜坡边缘的像素采集剖面建模方案，目的是减少图像中存在的虚假和破损的边缘。所生成的像素方案的集合与矢量顺序统计一起使用以减少从彩色图像到灰度图像转换时识别边缘的不精确性。 Pratt品质因数（PFOM）被用作现有的传统边缘检测算法和作为验证手段的开发算法之间的定量比较。所开发算法的PFOM值为0.8480，与现有的传统边缘检测算法相比有所改善。
