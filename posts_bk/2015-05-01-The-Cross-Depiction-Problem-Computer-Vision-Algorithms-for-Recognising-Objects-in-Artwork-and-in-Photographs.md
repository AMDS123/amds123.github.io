##### Abstract
The cross-depiction problem is that of recognising visual objects regardless of whether they are photographed, painted, drawn, etc. It is a potentially significant yet under-researched problem. Emulating the remarkable human ability to recognise objects in an astonishingly wide variety of depictive forms is likely to advance both the foundations and the applications of Computer Vision. In this paper we benchmark classification, domain adaptation, and deep learning methods; demonstrating that none perform consistently well in the cross-depiction problem. Given the current interest in deep learning, the fact such methods exhibit the same behaviour as all but one other method: they show a significant fall in performance over inhomogeneous databases compared to their peak performance, which is always over data comprising photographs only. Rather, we find the methods that have strong models of spatial relations between parts tend to be more robust and therefore conclude that such information is important in modelling object classes regardless of appearance details.

交叉描述问题是识别视觉对象，而不管它们是否被拍摄，绘画，绘制等等。这是一个潜在的显着但尚未被研究的问题。模拟人类以惊人的多种描述形式识别物体的能力可能会推动计算机视觉的基础和应用。在本文中，我们将分类，领域适应和深度学习方法作为基准;表明在交叉描述问题中没有一个表现良好。鉴于目前对深度学习的兴趣，事实上这些方法表现出与所有其他方法相同的行为：与其峰值性能相比，它们在非同类数据库上的性能显着下降，这总是超过仅包括照片的数据。相反，我们发现具有较强的部件之间的空间关系的强模型的方法趋向于更加健壮，因此得出这样的结论：无论外观细节如何，这样的信息对建模对象类都是重要的。
