##### Abstract
Color image segmentation is a very emerging topic for image processing research. Since it has the ability to present the result in a way that is much more close to the human yes perceive, so todays more research is going on this area. Choosing a proper color space is a very important issue for color image segmentation process. Generally LAB and HSV are the two frequently chosen color spaces. In this paper a comparative analysis is performed between these two color spaces with respect to color image segmentation. For measuring their performance, we consider the parameters: mse and psnr . It is found that HSV color space is performing better than LAB.

彩色图像分割是图像处理研究的一个新兴课题。由于它能够以更接近于人类感知的方式呈现结果，所以今天有更多的研究正在进行。选择合适的色彩空间是彩色图像分割过程中非常重要的一个问题。通常LAB和HSV是两个经常选择的色彩空间。本文对这两种颜色空间进行了彩色图像分割的比较分析。为了测量它们的性能，我们考虑参数：mse和psnr。发现HSV色彩空间比LAB要好。
