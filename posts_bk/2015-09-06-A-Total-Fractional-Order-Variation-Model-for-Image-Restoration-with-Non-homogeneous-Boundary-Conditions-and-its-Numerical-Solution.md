##### Abstract
To overcome the weakness of a total variation based model for image restoration, various high order (typically second order) regularization models have been proposed and studied recently. In this paper we analyze and test a fractional-order derivative based total $\alpha$-order variation model, which can outperform the currently popular high order regularization models. There exist several previous works using total $\alpha$-order variations for image restoration; however first no analysis is done yet and second all tested formulations, differing from each other, utilize the zero Dirichlet boundary conditions which are not realistic (while non-zero boundary conditions violate definitions of fractional-order derivatives). This paper first reviews some results of fractional-order derivatives and then analyzes the theoretical properties of the proposed total $\alpha$-order variational model rigorously. It then develops four algorithms for solving the variational problem, one based on the variational Split-Bregman idea and three based on direct solution of the discretise-optimization problem. Numerical experiments show that, in terms of restoration quality and solution efficiency, the proposed model can produce highly competitive results, for smooth images, to two established high order models: the mean curvature and the total generalized variation.

为了克服基于全变差的图像恢复模型的弱点，近来提出并研究了各种高阶（典型二阶）正则化模型。在本文中，我们分析和测试了一个基于分数阶导数的总$ \ alpha $ -order变化模型，它可以胜过目前流行的高阶正则化模型。以前的作品总共有$ \ alpha $ -order变体用于图像恢复;然而，首先还没有完成分析，而第二个彼此不同的所有测试配方利用不合实际的零狄氏（Dirichlet）边界条件（而非零边界条件违反分数阶导数的定义）。本文首先回顾了分数阶导数的一些结果，然后严格分析了所提出的$ \ alpha $阶变分模型的理论性质。然后提出了四种解决变分问题的算法，一种是基于变分裂巴雷克曼思想，另一种是直接求解离散优化问题。数值实验表明，该模型在恢复质量和求解效率方面，对于光滑的图像，可以产生高度竞争的结果，建立两个建立的高阶模型：平均曲率和总的广义变化。
