##### Abstract
This paper aims to make a graph representing an essential skeleton of a character from an image that includes a machine printed or a handwritten character using the growing neural gas (GNG) method and the relative neighborhood graph (RNG) algorithm. The visual system in our brain can recognize printed characters and handwritten characters easily, robustly, and precisely. How can our brains robustly recognize characters? In the visual processing in our brain, essential features of an object will be used for recognition. The essential features are crosses, corners, junctions and so on. These features may be useful for character recognition by a computer. However, extraction of the features is difficult. If the skeleton of a character is represented as a graph, the features can be more easily extracted. To extract the skeleton of a character as a graph from a character image, we used the GNG method and the RNG algorithm. We achieved to extract skeleton graphs from images including distorted, noisy, and handwritten characters.

本文旨在使用增长的神经气体（GNG）方法和相对邻域图（RNG）算法，从包含机器打印的图像或手写字符的图像中制作表示人物基本骨架的图形。我们大脑中的视觉系统可以轻松，健壮，准确地识别印刷字符和手写字符。我们的大脑如何可靠地识别人物？在我们大脑的视觉处理中，物体的基本特征将被用于识别。基本特点是十字架，角落，路口等。这些功能可能对计算机的字符识别有用。但是，提取特征是困难的。如果一个角色的骨架被表示成一个图形，那么这些特征可以更容易被提取出来。为了从字符图像中提取字符的骨架作为图形，我们使用了GNG方法和RNG算法。我们实现了从图像中提取骨架图形，包括扭曲，嘈杂和手写字符。
