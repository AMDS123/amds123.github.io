##### Abstract
In this paper, the answer selection problem in community question answering (CQA) is regarded as an answer sequence labeling task, and a novel approach is proposed based on the recurrent architecture for this problem. Our approach applies convolution neural networks (CNNs) to learning the joint representation of question-answer pair firstly, and then uses the joint representation as input of the long short-term memory (LSTM) to learn the answer sequence of a question for labeling the matching quality of each answer. Experiments conducted on the SemEval 2015 CQA dataset shows the effectiveness of our approach.

本文将社区问答答案（CQA）中的答案选择问题视为一个答案序列标注任务，并针对该问题提出了一种基于循环体系结构的新方法。我们的方法首先应用卷积神经网络（CNNs）对问题 - 答案对的联合表示进行学习，然后将联合表示作为长时短记忆（LSTM）的输入来学习问题答案序列，匹配每个答案的质量。在SemEval 2015 CQA数据集上进行的实验显示了我们方法的有效性。
