##### Abstract
Sketch-based face recognition is an interesting task in vision and multimedia research, yet it is quite challenging due to the great difference between face photos and sketches. In this paper, we propose a novel approach for photo-sketch generation, aiming to automatically transform face photos into detail-preserving personal sketches. Unlike the traditional models synthesizing sketches based on a dictionary of exemplars, we develop a fully convolutional network to learn the end-to-end photo-sketch mapping. Our approach takes whole face photos as inputs and directly generates the corresponding sketch images with efficient inference and learning, in which the architecture are stacked by only convolutional kernels of very small sizes. To well capture the person identity during the photo-sketch transformation, we define our optimization objective in the form of joint generative-discriminative minimization. In particular, a discriminative regularization term is incorporated into the photo-sketch generation, enhancing the discriminability of the generated person sketches against other individuals. Extensive experiments on several standard benchmarks suggest that our approach outperforms other state-of-the-art methods in both photo-sketch generation and face sketch verification.

基于素描的人脸识别在视觉和多媒体研究中是一个有趣的任务，但由于人脸照片和草图之间的巨大差异，它是相当具有挑战性的。在本文中，我们提出了一种新的照片素描生成方法，旨在自动将人脸照片转换为保存个人素描的细节。与基于示例词典的传统模型合成草图不同，我们开发了一个完全卷积网络来学习端到端的照片素描映射。我们的方法是以全脸照片作为输入，直接生成相应的素描图像，并进行高效的推理和学习，其中体系结构仅由非常小的卷积核来堆叠。为了在照片 - 草图变换中很好地捕捉到人物身份，我们以联合生成 - 区分最小化的形式定义了我们的优化目标。特别是，在图片生成中加入了区分正则化术语，增强了生成的人物草图与其他人的区别性。在几个标准基准上的大量实验表明，我们的方法在照片素描生成和脸部草图验证方面都优于其他最先进的方法。
