##### Abstract
In this paper, a novel encoding scheme combining Fisher vector and bag-of-words encodings has been proposed for recognizing action in videos. The proposed Hyper-Fisher vector encoding is sum of local Fisher vectors which are computed based on the traditional Bag-of-Words (BoW) encoding. Thus, the proposed encoding is simple and yet an effective representation over the traditional Fisher Vector encoding. By extensive evaluation on challenging action recognition datasets, viz., Youtube, Olympic Sports, UCF50 and HMDB51, we show that the proposed Hyper-Fisher Vector encoding improves the recognition performance by around 2-3% compared to the improved Fisher Vector encoding. We also perform experiments to show that the performance of the Hyper-Fisher Vector is robust to the dictionary size of the BoW encoding.

本文提出了一种结合Fisher矢量和词袋编码的新型编码方案来识别视频中的动作。所提出的Hyper-Fisher向量编码是基于传统Bag-of-Words（BoW）编码计算的局部Fisher向量的和。因此，所提出的编码是简单的，而且是对传统Fisher矢量编码的有效表示。通过对具有挑战性的动作识别数据集，即Youtube，奥林匹克运动，UCF50和HMDB51的广泛评估，我们表明，与改进的Fisher矢量编码相比，所提出的Hyper-Fisher矢量编码提高了约2-3％的识别性能。我们也进行实验来证明Hyper-Fisher向量的性能对于BoW编码的字典大小是稳健的。
