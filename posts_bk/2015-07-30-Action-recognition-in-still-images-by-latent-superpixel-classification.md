##### Abstract
Action recognition from still images is an important task of computer vision applications such as image annotation, robotic navigation, video surveillance and several others. Existing approaches mainly rely on either bag-of-feature representations or articulated body-part models. However, the relationship between the action and the image segments is still substantially unexplored. For this reason, in this paper we propose to approach action recognition by leveraging an intermediate layer of "superpixels" whose latent classes can act as attributes of the action. In the proposed approach, the action class is predicted by a structural model(learnt by Latent Structural SVM) based on measurements from the image superpixels and their latent classes. Experimental results over the challenging Stanford 40 Actions dataset report a significant average accuracy of 74.06% for the positive class and 88.50% for the negative class, giving evidence to the performance of the proposed approach.

静止图像的动作识别是计算机视觉应用的重要任务，如图像标注，机器人导航，视频监控等。现有的方法主要依靠特征包络表达或者关联的身体部位模型。然而，行动和形象片段之间的关系仍然是基本上未被探索的。出于这个原因，在本文中，我们建议通过利用潜在类可以作为行为的属性的中间层“超像素”来处理动作识别。在提出的方法中，动作类是由一个结构模型（由Latent Structural SVM学习）根据图像超像素及其潜在类的测量来预测的。在具有挑战性的斯坦福大学40项行动数据集上的实验结果显示，正面类别的平均准确率为74.06％，而负面类别的平均准确率为88.50％，为所提出方法的表现提供了证据。
