##### Abstract
Text mining is a process of extracting information of interest from text. Such a method includes techniques from various areas such as Information Retrieval (IR), Natural Language Processing (NLP), and Information Extraction (IE). In this study, text mining methods are applied to extract causal relations from maritime accident investigation reports collected from the Marine Accident Investigation Branch (MAIB). These causal relations provide information on various mechanisms behind accidents, including human and organizational factors relating to the accident. The objective of this study is to facilitate the analysis of the maritime accident investigation reports, by means of extracting contributory causes with more feasibility. A careful investigation of contributory causes from the reports provide opportunity to improve safety in future. Two methods have been employed in this study to extract the causal relations. They are 1) Pattern classification method and 2) Connectives method. The earlier one uses naive Bayes and Support Vector Machines (SVM) as classifiers. The latter simply searches for the words connecting cause and effect in sentences. The causal patterns extracted using these two methods are compared to the manual (human expert) extraction. The pattern classification method showed a fair and sensible performance with F-measure(average) = 65% when compared to connectives method with F-measure(average) = 58%. This study is an evidence, that text mining methods could be employed in extracting causal relations from marine accident investigation reports.

文本挖掘是从文本中提取感兴趣的信息的过程。这种方法包括来自各个领域的技术，如信息检索（IR），自然语言处理（NLP）和信息提取（IE）。在这项研究中，文本挖掘方法被用来从海事事故调查处（MAIB）收集的海事事故调查报告中提取因果关系。这些因果关系提供了有关事故背后的各种机制的信息，包括与事故有关的人和组织因素。本研究的目的是为了便于对海上事故调查报告进行分析，通过提取更为可行的交费事由。仔细调查报告中的贡献原因为今后提高安全性提供了机会。本研究采用了两种方法来提取因果关系。他们是1）模式分类方法和2）连接方法。较早的使用朴素贝叶斯和支持向量机（SVM）作为分类器。后者只是在句子中搜索连接因果关系的单词。将使用这两种方法提取的因果模式与手动（人类专家）提取进行比较。与F-measure（average）= 58％的结缔组织方法相比，模式分类方法显示F-measure（平均​​）= 65％的公平和合理的表现。这项研究是一个证据，文本挖掘方法可以用来从海洋事故调查报告中提取因果关系。
