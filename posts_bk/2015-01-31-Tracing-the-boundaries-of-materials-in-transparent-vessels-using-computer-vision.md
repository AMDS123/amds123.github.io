##### Abstract
Visual recognition of material boundaries in transparent vessels is valuable for numerous applications. Such recognition is essential for estimation of fill-level, volume and phase-boundaries as well as for tracking of such chemical processes as precipitation, crystallization, condensation, evaporation and phase-separation. The problem of material boundary recognition in images is particularly complex for materials with non-flat surfaces, i.e., solids, powders and viscous fluids, in which the material interfaces have unpredictable shapes. This work demonstrates a general method for finding the boundaries of materials inside transparent containers in images. The method uses an image of the transparent vessel containing the material and the boundary of the vessel in this image. The recognition is based on the assumption that the material boundary appears in the image in the form of a curve (with various constraints) whose endpoints are both positioned on the vessel contour. The probability that a curve matches the material boundary in the image is evaluated using a cost function based on some image properties along this curve. Several image properties were examined as indicators for the material boundary. The optimal boundary curve was found using Dijkstra's algorithm. The method was successfully examined for recognition of various types of phase-boundaries, including liquid-air, solid-air and solid-liquid interfaces, as well as for various types of glassware containers from everyday life and the chemistry laboratory (i.e., bottles, beakers, flasks, jars, columns, vials and separation-funnels). In addition, the method can be easily extended to materials carried on top of carrier vessels (i.e., plates, spoons, spatulas).

透明容器中的材料边界的视觉识别对于许多应用是有价值的。这种认识对于估计填充量，体积和相界以及追踪沉淀，结晶，冷凝，蒸发和相分离等化学过程是至关重要的。图像中材料边界识别的问题对于具有非平坦表面的材料，即固体，粉末和粘性流体，其中材料界面具有不可预知的形状而言尤其复杂。这项工作演示了寻找图像中透明容器内物质边界的一般方法。该方法使用包含该图像中的材料和容器的边界的透明容器的图像。识别是基于这样的假设：材料边界以曲线（具有各种约束）的形式出现在图像中，其端点都位于血管轮廓上。基于沿着该曲线的一些图像属性，使用成本函数评估曲线匹配图像中的材料边界的概率。检查了几个图像属性作为材料边界的指标。使用Dijkstra算法找到最佳边界曲线。该方法成功地检测了各种类型的相界，包括液 - 气，固 - 气和固 - 液界面以及日常生活中使用的各种类型的玻璃器皿容器和化学实验室（即瓶子，烧杯，烧瓶，罐子，柱子，小瓶和分离漏斗）。此外，该方法可以容易地扩展到载体容器（即，盘子，勺子，抹刀）顶部的材料。
