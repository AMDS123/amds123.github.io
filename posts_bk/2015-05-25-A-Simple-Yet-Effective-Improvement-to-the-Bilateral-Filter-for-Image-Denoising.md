##### Abstract
The bilateral filter has diverse applications in image processing, computer vision, and computational photography. In particular, this non-linear filter is quite effective in denoising images corrupted with additive Gaussian noise. The filter, however, is known to perform poorly at large noise levels. Several adaptations of the filter have been proposed in the literature to address this shortcoming, but often at an added computational cost. In this paper, we report a simple yet effective modification that improves the denoising performance of the bilateral filter at almost no additional cost. We provide visual and quantitative results on standard test images which show that this improvement is significant both visually and in terms of PSNR and SSIM (often as large as 5 dB). We also demonstrate how the proposed filtering can be implemented at reduced complexity by adapting a recent idea for fast bilateral filtering.

双边滤波器在图像处理，计算机视觉和计算摄影方面具有多种应用。特别是，这种非线性滤波器在对具有加性高斯噪声的图像进行去噪的过程中非常有效。然而，过滤器在大的噪音水平下表现不佳。为了解决这个缺点，文献中已经提出了一些滤波器的改进，但是通常会增加计算成本。在本文中，我们报告了一个简单而有效的修改，几乎不需要额外的成本就可以提高双边滤波器的去噪性能。我们在标准测试图像上提供视觉和定量结果，表明这种改进在视觉上和在PSNR和SSIM（通常高达5dB）方面都是显着的。我们还演示了如何通过适应最近的快速双边过滤的想法来降低复杂度来实现所提出的滤波。
