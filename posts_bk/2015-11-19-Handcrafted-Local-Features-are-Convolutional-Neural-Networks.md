##### Abstract
Image and video classification research has made great progress through the development of handcrafted local features and learning based features. These two architectures were proposed roughly at the same time and have flourished at overlapping stages of history. However, they are typically viewed as distinct approaches. In this paper, we emphasize their structural similarities and show how such a unified view helps us in designing features that balance efficiency and effectiveness. As an example, we study the problem of designing efficient video feature learning algorithms for action recognition. We approach this problem by first showing that local handcrafted features and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) share the same convolution-pooling network structure. We then propose a two-stream Convolutional ISA (ConvISA) that adopts the convolution-pooling structure of the state-of-the-art handcrafted video feature with greater modeling capacities and a cost-effective training algorithm. Through custom designed network structures for pixels and optical flow, our method also reflects distinctive characteristics of these two data sources. Our experimental results on standard action recognition benchmarks show that by focusing on the structure of CNNs, rather than end-to-end training methods, we are able to design an efficient and powerful video feature learning algorithm.

图像和视频分类研究通过手工本地特征和学习特征的发展取得了很大的进展。这两个架构大致同时提出，并在历史重叠的阶段蓬勃发展。但是，它们通常被视为不同的方法。在本文中，我们强调它们的结构相似性，并展示这种统一的观点如何帮助我们设计平衡效率和效果的特征。作为一个例子，我们研究了为动作识别设计高效的视频特征学习算法的问题。我们通过首先显示本地手工特征和卷积神经网络（CNN）共享相同的卷积网络结构来解决这个问题。然后，我们提出了一种双流卷积ISA（ConvISA），采用了最先进的手工视频特征的卷积池结构，具有更高的建模能力和成本有效的训练算法。通过定制设计的像素和光流网络结构，我们的方法也反映了这两个数据源的独特特征。我们在标准动作识别基准上的实验结果表明，通过关注CNN的结构，而不是端到端的训练方法，我们能够设计一个高效的，强大的视频特征学习算法。
