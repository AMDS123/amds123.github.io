##### Abstract
For several decades, image restoration remains an active research topic in low-level computer vision and hence new approaches are constantly emerging. However, many recently proposed algorithms achieve state-of-the-art performance only at the expense of very high computation time, which clearly limits their practical relevance. In this work, we propose a simple but effective approach with both high computational efficiency and high restoration quality. We extend conventional nonlinear reaction diffusion models by several parametrized linear filters as well as several parametrized influence functions. We propose to train the parameters of the filters and the influence functions through a loss based approach. Experiments show that our trained nonlinear reaction diffusion models largely benefit from the training of the parameters and finally lead to the best reported performance on common test datasets for image restoration. Due to their structural simplicity, our trained models are highly efficient and are also well-suited for parallel computation on GPUs.

几十年来，图像恢复仍然是低级计算机视觉领域的一个活跃的研究课题，因此新的方法不断涌现。然而，最近提出的许多算法只是以非常高的计算时间为代价来实现最先进的性能，这明显限制了它们的实际相关性。在这项工作中，我们提出了一个简单而有效的方法，同时具有高计算效率和高恢复质量。我们通过几个参数化的线性滤波器以及几个参数化的影响函数来扩展传统的非线性反应扩散模型。我们建议通过基于损失的方法来训练滤波器的参数和影响函数。实验表明，我们的训练非线性反应扩散模型很大程度上受益于参数的训练，并最终导致在常用测试数据集上图像恢复的最佳报告性能。由于其结构简单，我们的训练模型是高效的，也非常适合GPU上的并行计算。
