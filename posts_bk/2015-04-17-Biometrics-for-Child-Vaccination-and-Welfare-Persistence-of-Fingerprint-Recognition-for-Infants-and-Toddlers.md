##### Abstract
With a number of emerging applications requiring biometric recognition of children (e.g., tracking child vaccination schedules, identifying missing children and preventing newborn baby swaps in hospitals), investigating the temporal stability of biometric recognition accuracy for children is important. The persistence of recognition accuracy of three of the most commonly used biometric traits (fingerprints, face and iris) has been investigated for adults. However, persistence of biometric recognition accuracy has not been studied systematically for children in the age group of 0-4 years. Given that very young children are often uncooperative and do not comprehend or follow instructions, in our opinion, among all biometric modalities, fingerprints are the most viable for recognizing children. This is primarily because it is easier to capture fingerprints of young children compared to other biometric traits, e.g., iris, where a child needs to stare directly towards the camera to initiate iris capture. In this report, we detail our initiative to investigate the persistence of fingerprint recognition for children in the age group of 0-4 years. Based on preliminary results obtained for the data collected in the first phase of our study, use of fingerprints for recognition of 0-4 year-old children appears promising.

随着许多需要生物特征识别儿童的新兴应用（例如追踪儿童免疫接种时间表，识别失踪儿童和防止在医院中新生婴儿掉期），调查儿童的生物识别准确性的时间稳定性是重要的。已经针对成年人研究了三种最常用的生物特征（指纹，脸部和虹膜）的识别准确性的持续性。然而，对于0-4岁年龄段的儿童，尚未系统地研究生物特征识别准确性的持续性。鉴于幼儿往往不合作，不理解或遵循指示，在我们看来，在所有生物识别方式中，指纹是识别儿童最可行的。这主要是因为与其他生物特征（例如虹膜）相比，捕获幼儿的指纹更容易，其中儿童需要直接朝向摄像机盯着以启动虹膜捕捉。在这份报告中，我们详细介绍了我们主动调查0-4岁年龄组儿童指纹识别的持续性。根据我们在研究的第一阶段收集到的数据的初步结果，使用指纹识别0-4岁儿童看起来很有前景。
