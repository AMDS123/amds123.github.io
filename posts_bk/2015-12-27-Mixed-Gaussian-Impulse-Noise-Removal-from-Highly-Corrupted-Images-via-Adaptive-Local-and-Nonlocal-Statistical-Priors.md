##### Abstract
The motivation of this paper is to introduce a novel framework for the restoration of images corrupted by mixed Gaussian-impulse noise. To this aim, first, an adaptive curvelet thresholding criterion is proposed which tries to adaptively remove the perturbations appeared during denoising process. Then, a new statistical regularization term, called joint adaptive statistical prior (JASP), is established which enforces both the local and nonlocal statistical consistencies, simultaneously, in a unified manner. Furthermore, a novel technique for mixed Gaussian plus impulse noise removal using JASP in a variational scheme is developed--we refer to it as De-JASP. To efficiently solve the above variational scheme, an efficient alternating minimization algorithm based on split Bregman iterative framework is developed. Extensive experimental results manifest the effectiveness of the proposed method comparing with the current state-of-the-art methods in mixed Gaussian-impulse noise removal.

本文的动机是引入一个新的框架来恢复混合高斯脉冲噪声的图像。为此，首先提出了一种自适应Curvelet阈值准则，试图自适应地去除去噪过程中出现的干扰。然后，统一建立一个新的统计正规化术语，称为联合自适应统计优先（JASP），它同时强化本地和非本地统计的一致性。此外，还开发了一种在变分方案中使用JASP进行混合高斯加脉冲噪声去除的新技术 - 我们称之为De-JASP。为有效解决上述变分方案，提出了一种基于分裂Bregman迭代框架的有效交替最小化算法。广泛的实验结果表明，与混合高斯脉冲噪声去除中的当前现有技术方法相比，所提出方法的有效性。
