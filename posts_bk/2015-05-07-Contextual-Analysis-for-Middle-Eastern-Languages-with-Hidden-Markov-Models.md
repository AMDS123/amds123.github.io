##### Abstract
Displaying a document in Middle Eastern languages requires contextual analysis due to different presentational forms for each character of the alphabet. The words of the document will be formed by the joining of the correct positional glyphs representing corresponding presentational forms of the characters. A set of rules defines the joining of the glyphs. As usual, these rules vary from language to language and are subject to interpretation by the software developers. In this paper, we propose a machine learning approach for contextual analysis based on the first order Hidden Markov Model. We will design and build a model for the Farsi language to exhibit this technology. The Farsi model achieves 94 \% accuracy with the training based on a short list of 89 Farsi vocabularies consisting of 2780 Farsi characters. The experiment can be easily extended to many languages including Arabic, Urdu, and Sindhi. Furthermore, the advantage of this approach is that the same software can be used to perform contextual analysis without coding complex rules for each specific language. Of particular interest is that the languages with fewer speakers can have greater representation on the web, since they are typically ignored by software developers due to lack of financial incentives.

以中东语言显示文档需要上下文分析，因为字母表的每个字符都有不同的表现形式。文档的单词将通过连接代表相应字符表示形式的位置字形而形成。一组规则定义了字形的连接。像往常一样，这些规则因语言而异，并受软件开发人员的解释。在本文中，我们提出了一种基于一阶隐马尔可夫模型的机器学习方法。我们将设计和建立一个波斯语言的模型来展示这种技术。波斯语模型的训练基于一个由2780个波斯语字母构成的89个波斯语词汇短语列表，达到了94％的准确性。实验可以很容易地扩展到包括阿拉伯语，乌尔都语和信德语在内的多种语言。此外，这种方法的优点是可以使用相同的软件来执行上下文分析而无需为每种特定的语言编码复杂的规则。特别感兴趣的是，讲话者较少的语言在网络上可以有更多的代表性，因为由于缺乏财务激励，软件开发人员通常忽略它们。
