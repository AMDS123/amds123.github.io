##### Abstract
Dimensionality reduction (DR) methods have been commonly used as a principled way to understand the high-dimensional data such as facial images. In this paper, we propose a new supervised DR method called Optimized Projection for Sparse Representation based Classification (OP-SRC), which is based on the recent face recognition method, Sparse Representation based Classification (SRC). SRC seeks a sparse linear combination on all the training data for a given query image, and make the decision by the minimal reconstruction residual. OP-SRC is designed on the decision rule of SRC, it aims to reduce the within-class reconstruction residual and simultaneously increase the between-class reconstruction residual on the training data. The projections are optimized and match well with the mechanism of SRC. Therefore, SRC performs well in the OP-SRC transformed space. The feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed method is verified on the Yale, ORL and UMIST databases with promising results.

降维（DR）方法已被普遍用作理解高维数据如面部图像的原理性方法。在本文中，我们提出了一种新的基于稀疏表示分类（SRC）的人脸识别方法 - 基于稀疏表示的分类优化投影（OP-SRC）。 SRC在给定查询图像的所有训练数据上寻找稀疏线性组合，并且通过最小重构残差来做出决定。 OP-SRC是根据SRC的决策规则设计的，旨在减少课堂重构残差，同时增加训练数据间的类间重构残差。预测得到了优化，并与SRC的机制相匹配。因此，SRC在OP-SRC变换空间中表现良好。在Yale，ORL和UMIST数据库上验证了该方法的可行性和有效性，结果令人满意。
