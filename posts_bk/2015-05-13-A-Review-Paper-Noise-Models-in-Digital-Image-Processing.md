##### Abstract
Noise is always presents in digital images during image acquisition, coding, transmission, and processing steps. Noise is very difficult to remove it from the digital images without the prior knowledge of noise model. That is why, review of noise models are essential in the study of image denoising techniques. In this paper, we express a brief overview of various noise models. These noise models can be selected by analysis of their origin. In this way, we present a complete and quantitative analysis of noise models available in digital images.

在图像采集，编码，传输和处理步骤期间，噪声总是呈现在数字图像中。如果没有噪声模型的先验知识，噪声很难从数字图像中去除。这就是为什么噪声模型的评论在图像去噪技术研究中是必不可少的。在本文中，我们简要概述了各种噪声模型。这些噪声模型可以通过分析其来源来选择。通过这种方式，我们对数字图像中可用的噪声模型进行了完整的定量分析。
