##### Abstract
Distance metric learning aims to learn from the given training data a valid distance metric, with which the similarity between data samples can be more effectively evaluated for classification. Metric learning is often formulated as a convex or nonconvex optimization problem, while many existing metric learning algorithms become inefficient for large scale problems. In this paper, we formulate metric learning as a kernel classification problem, and solve it by iterated training of support vector machines (SVM). The new formulation is easy to implement, efficient in training, and tractable for large-scale problems. Two novel metric learning models, namely Positive-semidefinite Constrained Metric Learning (PCML) and Nonnegative-coefficient Constrained Metric Learning (NCML), are developed. Both PCML and NCML can guarantee the global optimality of their solutions. Experimental results on UCI dataset classification, handwritten digit recognition, face verification and person re-identification demonstrate that the proposed metric learning methods achieve higher classification accuracy than state-of-the-art methods and they are significantly more efficient in training.

距离度量学习旨在从给定的训练数据中学习一个有效的距离度量，利用这个距离度量可以更有效地评估数据样本之间的相似性。度量学习通常被表述为凸或非凸优化问题，而许多现有的度量学习算法对于大规模问题变得效率低下。在本文中，我们将度量学习作为一个核心分类问题，并通过支持向量机（SVM）的迭代训练来解决。新配方易于实施，培训效率高，易于解决大规模问题。开发了两个新的度量学习模型，即正半定约束度量学习（PCML）和非负系数约束度量学习（NCML）。 PCML和NCML都可以保证其解决方案的全局最优性。在UCI数据集分类，手写数字识别，人脸识别和人员重新识别的实验结果表明，提出的度量学习方法比现有技术方法获得更高的分类准确性，他们在训练中显着更有效。
