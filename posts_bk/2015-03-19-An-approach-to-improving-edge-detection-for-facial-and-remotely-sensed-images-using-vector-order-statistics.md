##### Abstract
This paper presents an improved edge detection algorithm for facial and remotely sensed images using vector order statistics. The developed algorithm processes colored images directly without been converted to gray scale. A number of the existing algorithms converts the colored images into gray scale before detection of edges. But this process leads to inaccurate precision of recognized edges, thus producing false and broken edges in the output edge map. Facial and remotely sensed images consist of curved edge lines which have to be detected continuously to prevent broken edges. In order to deal with this, a collection of pixel approach is introduced with a view to minimizing the false and broken edges that exists in the generated output edge map of facial and remotely sensed images.

本文提出了一种改进的面部和遥感图像边缘检测算法使用矢量顺序统计。开发的算法直接处理彩色图像，而不会转换为灰度。一些现有的算法在检测边缘之前将彩色图像转换成灰度。但是这个过程会导致识别边缘的精确度不准确，从而在输出边缘图上产生错误的边缘。面部和遥感图像由弯曲的边缘线组成，必须连续检测以防止边缘断裂。为了解决这个问题，引入了一个像素方法的集合，以最小化在生成的面部和遥感图像的输出边缘图中存在的错误和断裂边缘。
