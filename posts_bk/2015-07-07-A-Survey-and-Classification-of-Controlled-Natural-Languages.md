##### Abstract
What is here called controlled natural language (CNL) has traditionally been given many different names. Especially during the last four decades, a wide variety of such languages have been designed. They are applied to improve communication among humans, to improve translation, or to provide natural and intuitive representations for formal notations. Despite the apparent differences, it seems sensible to put all these languages under the same umbrella. To bring order to the variety of languages, a general classification scheme is presented here. A comprehensive survey of existing English-based CNLs is given, listing and describing 100 languages from 1930 until today. Classification of these languages reveals that they form a single scattered cloud filling the conceptual space between natural languages such as English on the one end and formal languages such as propositional logic on the other. The goal of this article is to provide a common terminology and a common model for CNL, to contribute to the understanding of their general nature, to provide a starting point for researchers interested in the area, and to help developers to make design decisions.

##### Abstract (translated by Google)
这里所谓的控制自然语言（CNL）传统上被赋予许多不同的名称。特别是在过去的四十年中，已经设计了多种这样的语言。它们被用于改善人与人之间的交流，改善翻译，或者为正式表示提供自然而直观的表示。尽管存在明显的差异，但把所有这些语言置于同一个保护伞下似乎是明智的。为了给各种语言带来秩序，这里给出一个通用的分类方案。给出了对现有英语CNL的全面调查，从1930年至今，列出并描述了100种语言。这些语言的分类表明，它们形成了一个单一的分散云，填补了自然语言之间的概念空间，例如一端是英语，另一端是形式语言，比如命题逻辑。本文的目标是为CNL提供一个通用的术语和通用模型，帮助他们理解其一般性质，为对该领域感兴趣的研究人员提供一个起点，帮助开发人员做出设计决策。
