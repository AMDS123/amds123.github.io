##### Abstract
The iterative phase retrieval problem for complex-valued objects from Fourier transform magnitude data is known to suffer from the twin image problem. In particular, when the object support is centro-symmetric, the iterative solution often stagnates such that the resultant complex image contains the features of both the desired solution and its inverted and complex-conjugated replica. The conventional approach to address the twin image problem is to modify the object support during initial iterations which can possibly lead to elimination of one of the twin images. However, at present there seems to be no deterministic procedure to make sure that the twin image will always be very weak or absent. In this work we make an important observation that the ideal solution without the twin image is typically more sparse (in some suitable transform domain) as compared to the stagnated solution containing the twin image. We further show that introducing a sparsity enhancing step in the iterative algorithm can address the twin image problem without the need to change the object support throughout the iterative process even when the object support is centro-symmetric. In a simulation study, we use binary and gray-scale pure phase objects and illustrate the effectiveness of the sparsity assisted phase recovery in the context of the twin image problem. The results have important implications for a wide range of topics in Physics where the phase retrieval problem plays a central role.

已知从傅里叶变换幅度数据的复值对象的迭代相位检索问题受到双图像问题的困扰。特别是，当对象支持是中心对称时，迭代解决方案经常停滞，使得所得到的复合图像包含期望解及其反转和复共轭复制品的特征。解决双图像问题的传统方法是在初始迭代期间修改对象支持，这可能导致消除双图像之一。但是，目前似乎没有确定性的程序来确保双胞胎的形象总是很弱或者不存在。在这项工作中，我们做了一个重要的观察，没有孪生图像的理想解决方案通常比含有孪生图像的停滞解决方案更稀疏（在一些合适的变换域中）。我们进一步表明，在迭代算法中引入稀疏增强步骤可以解决双图像问题，而无需在整个迭代过程中改变对象支持，即使对象支持是中心对称的。在一个模拟研究中，我们使用二元和灰度纯相对象，并说明在双图像问题的情况下稀疏辅助相位恢复的有效性。这个结果对于物理学中广泛的话题具有重要的意义，其中阶段检索问题起着核心作用。
