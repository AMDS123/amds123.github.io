##### Abstract
The alertness level of drivers can be estimated with the use of computer vision based methods. The level of fatigue can be found from the value of PERCLOS. It is the ratio of closed eye frames to the total frames processed. The main objective of the thesis is the design and implementation of real-time algorithms for measurement of PERCLOS. In this work we have developed a real-time system which is able to process the video onboard and to alarm the driver in case the driver is in alert. For accurate estimation of PERCLOS the frame rate should be greater than 4 and accuracy should be greater than 90%. For eye detection we have used mainly two approaches Haar classifier based method and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) based method for day time. During night time active Near Infra Red (NIR) illumination is used. Local Binary Pattern (LBP) histogram based method is used for the detection of eyes at night time. The accuracy rate of the algorithms was found to be more than 90% at frame rates more than 5 fps which was suitable for the application.

驾驶员的警觉水平可以通过使用基于计算机视觉的方法来估计。疲劳程度可以从PERCLOS的价值中找到。这是闭眼帧与处理的总帧数的比率。本文的主要目标是设计和实现PERCLOS测量的实时算法。在这项工作中，我们开发了一个实时系统，能够处理车载视频，并在驾驶员处于警戒状态时发出警报。为了精确估计PERCLOS，帧率应该大于4，精度应该大于90％。对于眼睛检测，我们主要使用基于Haar分类器的方法和基于主成分分析（PCA）的白天方法两种方法。在夜间，使用主动近红外（NIR）照明。基于局部二值模式（LBP）直方图的方法被用于在夜间检测眼睛。在帧速率超过5fps的情况下，算法的准确率达到90％以上，适合应用。
