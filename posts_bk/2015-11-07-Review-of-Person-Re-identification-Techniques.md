##### Abstract
Person re-identification across different surveillance cameras with disjoint fields of view has become one of the most interesting and challenging subjects in the area of intelligent video surveillance. Although several methods have been developed and proposed, certain limitations and unresolved issues remain. In all of the existing re-identification approaches, feature vectors are extracted from segmented still images or video frames. Different similarity or dissimilarity measures have been applied to these vectors. Some methods have used simple constant metrics, whereas others have utilised models to obtain optimised metrics. Some have created models based on local colour or texture information, and others have built models based on the gait of people. In general, the main objective of all these approaches is to achieve a higher-accuracy rate and lowercomputational costs. This study summarises several developments in recent literature and discusses the various available methods used in person re-identification. Specifically, their advantages and disadvantages are mentioned and compared.

人们在不同的监视摄像机之间重新识别不相交的视野已经成为智能视频监控领域中最有趣和最具挑战性的课题之一。虽然已经开发和提出了几种方法，但仍然存在某些限制和未解决的问题。在所有现有的重新识别方法中，从分段静止图像或视频帧中提取特征向量。对这些载体应用了不同的相似性或相异性度量。有些方法使用了简单的常量度量，而另一些方法则利用模型来获得优化度量。有的已经建立了基于局部颜色或纹理信息的模型，有的已经建立了基于人的步态的模型。总的来说，所有这些方法的主要目标是实现更高的准确率和更低的计算成本。这项研究总结了近期文献中的几个发展，并讨论了用于个人重新识别的各种可用方法。具体而言，他们的优点和缺点被提及和比较。
