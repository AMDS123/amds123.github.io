##### Abstract
Measuring the morphological parameters of galaxies is a key requirement for studying their formation and evolution. Surveys such as the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) have resulted in the availability of very large collections of images, which have permitted population-wide analyses of galaxy morphology. Morphological analysis has traditionally been carried out mostly via visual inspection by trained experts, which is time-consuming and does not scale to large ($\gtrsim10^4$) numbers of images. Although attempts have been made to build automated classification systems, these have not been able to achieve the desired level of accuracy. The Galaxy Zoo project successfully applied a crowdsourcing strategy, inviting online users to classify images by answering a series of questions. Unfortunately, even this approach does not scale well enough to keep up with the increasing availability of galaxy images. We present a deep neural network model for galaxy morphology classification which exploits translational and rotational symmetry. It was developed in the context of the Galaxy Challenge, an international competition to build the best model for morphology classification based on annotated images from the Galaxy Zoo project. For images with high agreement among the Galaxy Zoo participants, our model is able to reproduce their consensus with near-perfect accuracy ($> 99\%$) for most questions. Confident model predictions are highly accurate, which makes the model suitable for filtering large collections of images and forwarding challenging images to experts for manual annotation. This approach greatly reduces the experts' workload without affecting accuracy. The application of these algorithms to larger sets of training data will be critical for analysing results from future surveys such as the LSST.

测量星系的形态参数是研究星系形成和演化的关键要求。诸如斯隆数字巡天（SDSS）之类的调查已经产生了非常大的图像集合，这些图像允许人口范围的星系形态分析。形态分析传统上主要是通过经过训练的专家的视觉检查来进行的，这是耗时的，并且不能放大到大的图像数量。尽管已经尝试建立自动化分类系统，但是这些系统还不能达到所期望的准确性水平。银河动物园项目成功应用了众包策略，邀请在线用户通过回答一系列问题来分类图像。不幸的是，即使这种方法也不能很好地跟上星系图像日益增加的可用性。我们提出了一个深度神经网络模型，用于利用平移和旋转对称性的星系形态分类。它是在银河挑战赛（Galaxy Challenge）的背景下开发的，该挑战赛是根据银河动物园项目注释图像建立最佳形态分类模型的国际竞赛。对于Galaxy Zoo参与者之间高度一致的图像，我们的模型能够以近乎完美的准确度（$> 99 \％$）重现他们的共识。自信的模型预测是非常准确的，这使得该模型适合过滤大量图像集合，并将具有挑战性的图像转发给专家进行手动注释。这种方法大大减少了专家的工作量，而不影响准确性。将这些算法应用于更大的训练数据集对于分析LSST等未来调查结果至关重要。
