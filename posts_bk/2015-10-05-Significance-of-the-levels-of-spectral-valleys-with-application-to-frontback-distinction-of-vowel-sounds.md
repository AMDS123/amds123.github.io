##### Abstract
An objective critical distance (OCD) has been defined as that spacing between adjacent formants, when the level of the valley between them reaches the mean spectral level. The measured OCD lies in the same range (viz., 3-3.5 bark) as the critical distance determined by subjective experiments for similar experimental conditions. The level of spectral valley serves a purpose similar to that of the spacing between the formants with an added advantage that it can be measured from the spectral envelope without an explicit knowledge of formant frequencies. Based on the relative spacing of formant frequencies, the level of the spectral valley, VI (between F1 and F2) is much higher than the level of VII (spectral valley between F2 and F3) for back vowels and vice-versa for front vowels. Classification of vowels into front/back distinction with the difference (VI-VII) as an acoustic feature, tested using TIMIT, NTIMIT, Tamil and Kannada language databases gives, on the average, an accuracy of about 95%, which is comparable to the accuracy (90.6%) obtained using a neural network classifier trained and tested using MFCC as the feature vector for TIMIT database. The acoustic feature (VI-VII) has also been tested for its robustness on the TIMIT database for additive white and babble noise and an accuracy of about 95% has been obtained for SNRs down to 25 dB for both types of noise.

客观临界距离（OCD）被定义为相邻峰之间的间距，当它们之间的谷的高度达到平均光谱水平时。测量的OCD与相似实验条件下的主观实验所确定的临界距离处于相同的范围内（即3-3.5树皮）。谱谷的水平用于类似于共振峰之间的间距的目的，另外的优点是可以从频谱包络中测量，而不需要明确的共振峰频率的知识。基于共振峰频率的相对间距，对于后元音来说，频谱谷V1（在F1和F2之间）的水平远高于VII（F2和F3之间的频谱谷）的水平，反之前元音的水平也是如此。元音到前/后的区别与所述差（VI-VII），为声学特征的分类，使用TIMIT，NTIMIT，泰米尔语和埃纳德语语言数据库给出，其平均为约95％的准确度，这与测试使用MFCC作为TIMIT数据库的特征向量训练和测试的神经网络分类器获得准确性（90.6％）。声学特征（VI-VII）也已经在TIMIT数据库上用于加性白噪声和巴伯噪声的鲁棒性进行了测试，对于两种类型的噪声，对于低至25dB的SNR，已经获得约95％的准确度。
