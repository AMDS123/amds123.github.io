##### Abstract
Most density-based clustering methods largely rely on how well the underlying density is estimated. However, density estimation itself is also a challenging problem, especially the determination of the kernel bandwidth. A large bandwidth could lead to the over-smoothed density estimation in which the number of density peaks could be less than the true clusters, while a small bandwidth could lead to the under-smoothed density estimation in which spurious density peaks, or called the "ripple noise", would be generated in the estimated density. In this paper, we propose a density-based hierarchical clustering method, called the Deep Nearest Neighbor Descent (D-NND), which could learn the underlying density structure layer by layer and capture the cluster structure at the same time. The over-smoothed density estimation could be largely avoided and the negative effect of the under-estimated cases could be also largely reduced. Overall, D-NND presents not only the strong capability of discovering the underlying cluster structure but also the remarkable reliability due to its insensitivity to parameters.

##### Abstract (translated by Google)
大多数基于密度的聚类方法在很大程度上取决于估算底层密度的程度。然而，密度估计本身也是一个具有挑战性的问题，尤其是确定内核带宽。较大的带宽可能会导致过度平滑的密度估计，其中密度峰值的数量可能会少于真实的聚类，而较小的带宽可能会导致密度估计不足，即杂散密度达到峰值，或称为“纹波噪声“将在估计的密度中产生。在本文中，我们提出了一种基于密度的层次聚类方法，称为深度最近邻下降（D-NND），它可以逐层学习底层密度结构，同时捕获聚类结构。过度平滑的密度估计可以在很大程度上避免，低估的情况的负面影响也可以大大减少。总体而言，D-NND不仅具有发现潜在群集结构的强大能力，而且由于其对参数不敏感而具有显着的可靠性。
