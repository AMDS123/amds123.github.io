##### Abstract
User reviews of mobile apps often contain complaints or suggestions which are valuable for app developers to improve user experience and satisfaction. However, due to the large volume and noisy-nature of those reviews, manually analyzing them for useful opinions is inherently challenging. To address this problem, we propose MARK, a keyword-based framework for semi-automated review analysis. MARK allows an analyst describing his interests in one or some mobile apps by a set of keywords. It then finds and lists the reviews most relevant to those keywords for further analysis. It can also draw the trends over time of those keywords and detect their sudden changes, which might indicate the occurrences of serious issues. To help analysts describe their interests more effectively, MARK can automatically extract keywords from raw reviews and rank them by their associations with negative reviews. In addition, based on a vector-based semantic representation of keywords, MARK can divide a large set of keywords into more cohesive subsets, or suggest keywords similar to the selected ones.

移动应用程序的用户评论通常包含对于应用程序开发者来说有价值的投诉或建议，以改善用户体验和满意度然而，由于这些评论的大量和嘈杂性质，手动分析它们以获得有用的意见本质上是具有挑战性的。为了解决这个问题，我们提出了一个基于关键词的半自动化审查分析框架MARK。 MARK允许分析师通过一组关键字在一个或一些移动应用中描述他的兴趣。然后，它会查找并列出与这些关键字最相关的评论以供进一步分析。它也可以绘制这些关键字随时间的变化趋势，并检测它们的突然变化，这可能表明发生了严重的问题。为了帮助分析师更有效地描述自己的兴趣，MARK可以自动从原始评论中提取关键字，并通过与负面评论的关联来排名。另外，MARK可以基于关键词的基于矢量的语义表示，将大量关键字分成更紧密的子集，或者建议类似于所选关键字的关键字。
