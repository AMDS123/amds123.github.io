##### Abstract
The aim of this paper is to present an integrated system consisted of a RGB-D camera and a software able to monitor shoppers in intelligent retail environments. We propose an innovative low cost smart system that can understand the shoppers' behavior and, in particular, their interactions with the products in the shelves, with the aim to develop an automatic RGB-D technique for video analysis. The system of cameras detects the presence of people and univocally identifies them. Through the depth frames, the system detects the interactions of the shoppers with the products on the shelf and determines if a product is picked up or if the product is taken and then put back and finally, if there is not contact with the products. The system is low cost and easy to install, and experimental results demonstrated that its performances are satisfactory also in real environments.

本文的目的是介绍一个由RGB-D摄像机和能够在智能零售环境中监控购物者的软件组成的集成系统。我们提出了一个创新的低成本智能系统，可以理解购物者的行为，尤其是他们与货架上产品的相互作用，旨在开发视频分析的自动RGB-D技术。摄像机系统检测到人的存在，并单独识别他们。通过深度框架，系统检测购物者与货架上的产品的相互作用，并确定是否拾取产品或者如果产品被取走然后放回，最后如果没有与产品接触。该系统成本低廉，易于安装，实验结果表明，在真实环境下，其性能也令人满意。
