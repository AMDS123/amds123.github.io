##### Abstract
The prediction of saliency areas in images has been traditionally addressed with hand crafted features based on neuroscience principles. This paper however addresses the problem with a completely data-driven approach by training a convolutional network. The learning process is formulated as a minimization of a loss function that measures the Euclidean distance of the predicted saliency map with the provided ground truth. The recent publication of large datasets of saliency prediction has provided enough data to train a not very deep architecture which is both fast and accurate. The convolutional network in this paper, named JuntingNet, won the LSUN 2015 challenge on saliency prediction with a superior performance in all considered metrics.

传统上，图像中显着区域的预测是基于神经科学原理的手工制作的特征。然而，本文通过训练卷积网络以完全数据驱动的方式解决了这个问题。学习过程被表述为损失函数的最小化，其测量预测的显着图的欧几里德距离与所提供的基本事实。最近出版的大型数据集的显着性预测提供了足够的数据来训练一个不是很深的架构，既快速又准确。本文中的卷积网络名为JuntingNet，赢得了LSUN 2015对显着性预测的挑战，在所有考虑的指标中都有出众的性能。
