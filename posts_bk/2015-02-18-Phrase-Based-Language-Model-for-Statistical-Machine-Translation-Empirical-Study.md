##### Abstract
Reordering is a challenge to machine translation (MT) systems. In MT, the widely used approach is to apply word based language model (LM) which considers the constituent units of a sentence as words. In speech recognition (SR), some phrase based LM have been proposed. However, those LMs are not necessarily suitable or optimal for reordering. We propose two phrase based LMs which considers the constituent units of a sentence as phrases. Experiments show that our phrase based LMs outperform the word based LM with the respect of perplexity and n-best list re-ranking.

重新排序是机器翻译（MT）系统的一个挑战。在MT中，广泛使用的方法是应用基于单词的语言模型（LM），其将句子的构成单位看作单词。在语音识别（SR）中，已经提出了一些基于短语的LM。但是，这些LM对于重新排序并不一定合适或最佳。我们提出两个基于短语的LM，它们将句子的组成单位看作短语。实验表明，基于短语的词汇表达方式优于基于词汇表达的词汇表达方式，表现出困惑性和最佳列表重排。
