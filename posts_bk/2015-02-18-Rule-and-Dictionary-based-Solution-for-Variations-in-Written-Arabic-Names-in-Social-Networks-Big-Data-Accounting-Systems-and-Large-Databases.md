##### Abstract
This paper investigates the problem that some Arabic names can be written in multiple ways. When someone searches for only one form of a name, neither exact nor approximate matching is appropriate for returning the multiple variants of the name. Exact matching requires the user to enter all forms of the name for the search, and approximate matching yields names not among the variations of the one being sought. In this paper, we attempt to solve the problem with a dictionary of all Arabic names mapped to their different (alternative) writing forms. We generated alternatives based on rules we derived from reviewing the first names of 9.9 million citizens and former citizens of Jordan. This dictionary can be used for both standardizing the written form when inserting a new name into a database and for searching for the name and all its alternative written forms. Creating the dictionary automatically based on rules resulted in at least 7% erroneous acceptance errors and 7.9% erroneous rejection errors. We addressed the errors by manually editing the dictionary. The dictionary can be of help to real world-databases, with the qualification that manual editing does not guarantee 100% correctness.

本文研究了一些阿拉伯语名字可以多种写法的问题。当某人只搜索一个名称的形式时，不准确或近似的匹配都不适用于返回名称的多个变体。完全匹配要求用户输入所有形式的搜索名称，并且近似匹配得到的名称不在所寻求的变体之中。在本文中，我们试图用一个所有阿拉伯名字映射到不同的（替代）写作形式的字典来解决这个问题。根据我们通过审查约990万公民和约旦前公民的名字而得出的规则，我们产生了替代方案。这个字典既可以用来在向数据库中插入一个新名字的时候标准化书面形式，也可以用来搜索名字及其所有可选的书面形式。根据规则自动创建字典会导致至少7％的错误接受错误和7.9％的错误拒绝错误。我们通过手动编辑字典来解决错误。字典可以帮助真实的世界数据库，具有手动编辑不保证100％正确性的限制。
