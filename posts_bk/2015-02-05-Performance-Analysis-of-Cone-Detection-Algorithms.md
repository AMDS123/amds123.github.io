##### Abstract
Many algorithms have been proposed to help clinicians evaluate cone density and spacing, as these may be related to the onset of retinal diseases. However, there has been no rigorous comparison of the performance of these algorithms. In addition, the performance of such algorithms is typically determined by comparison with human observers. Here we propose a technique to simulate realistic images of the cone mosaic. We use the simulated images to test the performance of two popular cone detection algorithms and we introduce an algorithm which is used by astronomers to detect stars in astronomical images. We use Free Response Operating Characteristic (FROC) curves to evaluate and compare the performance of the three algorithms. This allows us to optimize the performance of each algorithm. We observe that performance is significantly enhanced by up-sampling the images. We investigate the effect of noise and image quality on cone mosaic parameters estimated using the different algorithms, finding that the estimated regularity is the most sensitive parameter.

已经提出了许多算法来帮助临床医生评估椎密度和间隔，因为这些可能与视网膜疾病的发作有关。然而，这些算法的性能没有严格的比较。另外，这种算法的性能通常是通过与人类观察者比较来确定的。在这里我们提出一种技术来模拟锥面马赛克的逼真图像。我们使用模拟图像来测试两种流行的锥体检测算法的性能，并介绍一种天文学家用来检测天文图像中恒星的算法。我们使用自由响应操作特性（FROC）曲线来评估和比较三种算法的性能。这使我们能够优化每个算法的性能。我们观察到，通过上采样图像，性能显着提高。我们研究了噪声和图像质量对使用不同算法估计的锥体镶嵌参数的影响，发现估计的规律性是最敏感的参数。本文发表于JOSA A，经OSA许可，可作为电子版本转载。该文件可在OSA网站的以下URL中找到：http http系统或多重复制或通过电子或其他方式分发到多个地点是受法律规定的处罚。
