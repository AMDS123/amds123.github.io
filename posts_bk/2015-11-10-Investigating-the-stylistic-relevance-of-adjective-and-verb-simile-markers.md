##### Abstract
Similes play an important role in literary texts not only as rhetorical devices and as figures of speech but also because of their evocative power, their aptness for description and the relative ease with which they can be combined with other figures of speech (Israel et al. 2004). Detecting all types of simile constructions in a particular text therefore seems crucial when analysing the style of an author. Few research studies however have been dedicated to the study of less prominent simile markers in fictional prose and their relevance for stylistic studies. The present paper studies the frequency of adjective and verb simile markers in a corpus of British and French novels in order to determine which ones are really informative and worth including in a stylistic analysis. Furthermore, are those adjectives and verb simile markers used differently in both languages?

##### Abstract (translated by Google)
文学作品在文学作品中起着重要的作用，不仅作为修辞手段和修辞手段，而且还因为它们具有唤起的力量，适于描述的特点，以及与其他修辞格相结合的相对容易性（Israel et al。 2004）。当分析作者的风格时，检测特定文本中的所有类型的明喻结构似乎是至关重要的。然而，很少有研究专门研究虚构散文中较不明显的明喻标记及其对文体研究的相关性。本文研究了英法小说语料库中形容词和动词指示语的频率，以确定哪些语料具有信息性，值得在文体分析中加以考虑。此外，这两种语言中使用的形容词和动词明喻标记是不同的？
