##### Abstract
In computer vision, image segmentation is always selected as a major research topic by researchers. Due to its vital rule in image processing, there always arises the need of a better image segmentation method. Clustering is an unsupervised study with its application in almost every field of science and engineering. Many researchers used clustering in image segmentation process. But still there requires improvement of such approaches. In this paper, a novel approach for clustering based image segmentation is proposed. Here, we give importance on color space and choose lab for this task. The famous hard clustering algorithm K-means is used, but as its performance is dependent on choosing a proper distance measure, so, we go for cosine distance measure. Then the segmented image is filtered with sobel filter. The filtered image is analyzed with marker watershed algorithm to have the final segmented result of our original image. The MSE and PSNR values are evaluated to observe the performance.

在计算机视觉中，图像分割总是被研究者选为主要研究课题。由于其在图像处理中的重要规则，总是需要更好的图像分割方法。聚类是一个无监督的研究，其应用于几乎所有的科学和工程领域。许多研究人员在图像分割过程中使用聚类。但仍然需要改进这种方法。本文提出了一种基于聚类的图像分割方法。在这里，我们重视色彩空间，并选择实验室来完成这个任务。着名的硬聚类算法K-means被使用，但是由于其性能取决于选择一个合适的距离度量，所以我们去求余弦距离。然后用sobel滤波器对分段图像进行滤波。用标记分水岭算法分析滤波后的图像，得到原始图像的最终分割结果。评估MSE和PSNR值以观察性能。
