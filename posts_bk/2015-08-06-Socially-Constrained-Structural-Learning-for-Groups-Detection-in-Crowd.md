##### Abstract
Modern crowd theories agree that collective behavior is the result of the underlying interactions among small groups of individuals. In this work, we propose a novel algorithm for detecting social groups in crowds by means of a Correlation Clustering procedure on people trajectories. The affinity between crowd members is learned through an online formulation of the Structural SVM framework and a set of specifically designed features characterizing both their physical and social identity, inspired by Proxemic theory, Granger causality, DTW and Heat-maps. To adhere to sociological observations, we introduce a loss function (G-MITRE) able to deal with the complexity of evaluating group detection performances. We show our algorithm achieves state-of-the-art results when relying on both ground truth trajectories and tracklets previously extracted by available detector/tracker systems.

现代人群理论认为，集体行为是小群体之间潜在相互作用的结果。在这项工作中，我们提出了一种新颖的算法，用于在人群轨迹上通过相关聚类过程来检测人群中的社会群体。群众成员之间的亲密关系是通过在线的结构支持向量机框架和一系列专门设计的特征来体现其身体和社会身份，受到近代理论，格兰杰因果关系，大卫王时代和热图的启发而学到的。为了坚持社会学观察，我们引入了能够处理群体检测表现的复杂性的损失函数（G-MITER）。我们展示了当依靠既有的探测器/跟踪系统提取的地面真实轨迹和轨迹时，我们的算法实现了最先进的结果。
