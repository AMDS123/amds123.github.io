##### Abstract
We present a complete methodology for authenticating local bee pollen against fraudulent samples using image processing and machine learning techniques. The proposed standard methods do not need expensive equipment such as advanced microscopes and can be used for a preliminary fast rejection of unknown pollen types. The system is able to rapidly reject the non-local pollen samples with inexpensive hardware and without the need to send the product to the laboratory. Methods are based on the color properties of bee pollen loads images and the use of one-class classifiers which are appropriate to reject unknown pollen samples when there is limited data about them. The validation of the method is carried out by authenticating Spanish bee pollen types. Experimentation shows that the proposed methods can obtain an overall authentication accuracy of 94%. We finally illustrate the user interaction with the software in some practical cases by showing the developed application prototype.

我们提出一个完整的方法来验证当地的蜂花粉与欺诈样品使用图像处理和机器学习技术。所提出的标准方法不需要昂贵的设备，如高级显微镜，并可用于初步快速排除未知花粉类型。该系统能够以廉价的硬件快速拒绝非本地花粉样品，而不需要将产品送到实验室。方法基于蜂花粉负荷图像的颜色属性以及使用一类分类器，当数据有限时，适用于拒绝未知花粉样品。该方法的验证通过鉴定西班牙蜂花粉类型来进行。实验表明，所提出的方法可以获得94％的总体验证准确度。通过展示开发的应用程序原型，我们最终在一些实际案例中说明了用户与软件的交互。
