##### Abstract
Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is a crucial medical imaging technology for the screening and diagnosis of frequently occurring cancers. However image quality may suffer by long acquisition times for MRIs due to patient motion, as well as result in great patient discomfort. Reducing MRI acquisition time can reduce patient discomfort and as a result reduces motion artifacts from the acquisition process. Compressive sensing strategies, when applied to MRI, have been demonstrated to be effective at decreasing acquisition times significantly by sparsely sampling the \emph{k}-space during the acquisition process. However, such a strategy requires advanced reconstruction algorithms to produce high quality and reliable images from compressive sensing MRI. This paper proposes a new reconstruction approach based on cross-domain stochastically fully connected conditional random fields (CD-SFCRF) for compressive sensing MRI. The CD-SFCRF introduces constraints in both \emph{k}-space and spatial domains within a stochastically fully connected graphical model to produce improved MRI reconstruction. Experimental results using T2-weighted (T2w) imaging and diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) of the prostate show strong performance in preserving fine details and tissue structures in the reconstructed images when compared to other tested methods even at low sampling rates.

磁共振成像（MRI）是用于筛查和诊断频繁发生的癌症的关键医学成像技术。然而，由于患者的运动，MRI的图像质量可能会受到很长的采集时间的影响，并且会导致很大的患者不适感。减少MRI采集时间可以减少患者的不适，从而减少采集过程中的运动伪影。压缩感知策略在应用于MRI时，通过在采集过程中稀疏采样\ emph {k}空间已被证明能有效地减少采集时间。然而，这样的策略需要先进的重建算法来从压缩感测MRI产生高质量和可靠的图像。本文提出了一种基于交叉域随机全连通条件随机场（CD-SFCRF）的压缩感知MRI重建方法。 CD-SFCRF在随机完全连接的图形模型内的\ emph {k}空间和空间域中引入约束，以产生改进的MRI重建。与其他测试方法相比，即使在低采样率下，使用T2加权（T2w）成像和前列腺扩散加权成像（DWI）的实验结果在保留重建图像中的精细细节和组织结构方面表现出强的性能。
