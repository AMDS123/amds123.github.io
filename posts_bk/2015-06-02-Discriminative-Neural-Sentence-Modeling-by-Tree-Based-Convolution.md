##### Abstract
This paper proposes a tree-based convolutional neural network (TBCNN) for discriminative sentence modeling. Our models leverage either constituency trees or dependency trees of sentences. The tree-based convolution process extracts sentences' structural features, and these features are aggregated by max pooling. Such architecture allows short propagation paths between the output layer and underlying feature detectors, which enables effective structural feature learning and extraction. We evaluate our models on two tasks: sentiment analysis and question classification. In both experiments, TBCNN outperforms previous state-of-the-art results, including existing neural networks and dedicated feature/rule engineering. We also make efforts to visualize the tree-based convolution process, shedding light on how our models work.

本文提出了一种基于树的卷积神经网络（TBCNN）进行判别性句子建模。我们的模型利用选区树或句子的依赖树。基于树的卷积过程提取句子的结构特征，并且这些特征通过最大池合并。这样的架构允许输出层和底层特征检测器之间的短传播路径，这使得能够进行有效的结构特征学习和提取。我们评估模型的两个任务：情感分析和问题分类。在这两个实验中，TBCNN都胜过了先前的最新成果，包括现有的神经网络和专用特征/规则工程。我们也努力使基于树的卷积过程可视化，揭示我们的模型如何工作。
