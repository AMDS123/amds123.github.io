##### Abstract
Brains and sensory systems evolved to guide motion. Central to this task is controlling the approach to stationary obstacles and detecting moving organisms. Looming has been proposed as the main monocular visual cue for detecting the approach of other animals and avoiding collisions with stationary obstacles. Elegant neural mechanisms for looming detection have been found in the brain of insects and vertebrates. However, looming has not been analyzed in the context of collisions between two moving animals. We propose an alternative strategy, Generalized Regressive Motion (GRM), which is consistent with recently observed behavior in fruit flies. Geometric analysis proves that GRM is a reliable cue to collision among conspecifics, whereas agent-based modeling suggests that GRM is a better cue than looming as a means to detect approach, prevent collisions and maintain mobility.

大脑和感官系统演变为引导运动。这个任务的核心是控制静止的障碍物的方法和检测移动的生物体。作为检测其他动物接近和避免与静止障碍碰撞的主要单眼视觉提示，提出了隐现。已经在昆虫和脊椎动物的大脑中发现了隐约检测的优雅神经机制。然而，在两个移动的动物碰撞的情况下，还没有分析隐现。我们提出一种替代策略，广义回归运动（GRM），这与最近在果蝇中观察到的行为是一致的。几何分析证明，GRM是同类之间可靠的碰撞提示，而基于Agent的建模表明，GRM是一种更好的提示，作为检测方法，防止碰撞和保持移动性的一种手段。
