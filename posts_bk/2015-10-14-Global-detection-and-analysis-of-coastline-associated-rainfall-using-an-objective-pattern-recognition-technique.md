##### Abstract
Coastally associated rainfall is a common feature especially in tropical and subtropical regions. However, it has been difficult to quantify the contribution of coastal rainfall features to the overall local rainfall. We develop a novel technique to objectively identify precipitation associated with land-sea interaction and apply it to satellite based rainfall estimates. The Maritime Continent, the Bight of Panama, Madagascar and the Mediterranean are found to be regions where land-sea interactions plays a crucial role in the formation of precipitation. In these regions $\approx$ 40% to 60% of the total rainfall can be related to coastline effects. Due to its importance for the climate system, the Maritime Continent is a particular region of interest with high overall amounts of rainfall and large fractions resulting from land-sea interactions throughout the year. To demonstrate the utility of our identification method we investigate the influence of several modes of variability, such as the Madden-Julian-Oscillation and the El Ni\~no Southern Oscillation, on coastal rainfall behavior. The results suggest that during large scale suppressed convective conditions coastal effects tend modulate the rainfall over the Maritime Continent leading to enhanced rainfall over land regions compared to the surrounding oceans. We propose that the novel objective dataset of coastally influenced precipitation can be used in a variety of ways, such as to inform cumulus parametrization or as an additional tool for evaluating the simulation of coastal precipitation within weather and climate models.

尤其是在热带和亚热带地区，沿海相关的降雨是一个共同特征。然而，难以量化沿海降雨特征对当地整体降雨量的贡献。我们开发了一种新颖的技术，客观地确定与陆地 - 海洋相互作用相关的降水，并将其应用于基于卫星的降雨估计。发现海洋大陆，巴拿马湾，马达加斯加和地中海是陆地 - 海洋相互作用在降水形成中起决定性作用的地区。在这些地区，总降雨量约40％至60％可能与海岸线效应有关。由于它对气候系统的重要性，海洋大陆是一个特别感兴趣的地区，全年降雨总量大，海陆相互作用大。为了证明我们的识别方法的实用性，我们研究了几种模式的变化的影响，如Madden-Julian-Oscillation和El Ni-no Southern Oscillation对沿海降雨行为的影响。研究结果表明，在大规模抑制对流条件下，沿海作用趋于调节海陆大陆的降水，导致与周围海域相比降水量增加。我们提出，可以用多种方式使用海岸影响降水的新型客观数据集，如通知积云参数化或作为评估天气和气候模式中沿海降水模拟的额外工具。
