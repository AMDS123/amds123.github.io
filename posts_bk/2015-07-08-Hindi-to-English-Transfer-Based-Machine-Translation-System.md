##### Abstract
In large societies like India there is a huge demand to convert one human language into another. Lots of work has been done in this area. Many transfer based MTS have developed for English to other languages, as MANTRA CDAC Pune, MATRA CDAC Pune, SHAKTI IISc Bangalore and IIIT Hyderabad. Still there is a little work done for Hindi to other languages. Currently we are working on it. In this paper we focus on designing a system, that translate the document from Hindi to English by using transfer based approach. This system takes an input text check its structure through parsing. Reordering rules are used to generate the text in target language. It is better than Corpus Based MTS because Corpus Based MTS require large amount of word aligned data for translation that is not available for many languages while Transfer Based MTS requires only knowledge of both the languages(source language and target language) to make transfer rules. We get correct translation for simple assertive sentences and almost correct for complex and compound sentences.

在印度这样的大型社会中，将一种人类语言转换为另一种语言的需求巨大。这方面做了大量的工作。许多基于转移的MTS已经开发了英语到其他语言，如MANTRA CDAC Pune，MATRA CDAC Pune，SHAKTI IISc Bangalore和IIIT Hyderabad。尽管如此，还是有一些印度语为其他语言做了一些工作。目前我们正在努力。在本文中，我们着重于设计一个系统，使用基于转移的方法将文档从印地文翻译成英文。该系统通过解析输入文本检查其结构。重新排序规则用于生成目标语言的文本。它比基于语料库的MTS更好，因为基于语料库的MTS需要大量用于翻译的字对齐数据，而许多语言不可用，而基于转移的MTS只需要知道两种语言（源语言和目标语言）来制定传输规则。我们得到正确的翻译简单的自信句子，几乎正确的复杂和复合句子。
