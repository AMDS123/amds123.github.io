##### Abstract
Person names and location names are essential building blocks for identifying events and social networks in historical documents that were written in literary Chinese. We take the lead to explore the research on algorithmically recognizing named entities in literary Chinese for historical studies with language-model based and conditional-random-field based methods, and extend our work to mining the document structures in historical documents. Practical evaluations were conducted with texts that were extracted from more than 220 volumes of local gazetteers (Difangzhi). Difangzhi is a huge and the single most important collection that contains information about officers who served in local government in Chinese history. Our methods performed very well on these realistic tests. Thousands of names and addresses were identified from the texts. A good portion of the extracted names match the biographical information currently recorded in the China Biographical Database (CBDB) of Harvard University, and many others can be verified by historians and will become as new additions to CBDB.

人名和地名是用文学汉语写成的历史文献中识别事件和社交网络的重要组成部分。我们率先探索了基于语言模型和基于条件随机场的方法对历史研究中的文学命名实体进行算法识别的研究，并将我们的工作扩展到挖掘历史文献中的文档结构。从220多卷当地地名录（迪番至）中摘录的文本进行实际评估。 “弥丹志”是中国历史上地方政府官员信息最丰富，最重要的一部。我们的方法在这些现实的测试中表现得非常好成千上万的名字和地址是从文本中确定的。这些提取的名字中有很大一部分与哈佛大学中国传记数据库（CBDB）中记录的传记信息相匹配，许多其他信息可以由历史学家验证，并将成为CBDB的新增内容。
