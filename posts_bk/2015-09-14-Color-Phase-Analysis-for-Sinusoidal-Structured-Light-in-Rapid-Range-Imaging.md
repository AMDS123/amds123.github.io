##### Abstract
Active range sensing using structured-light is the most accurate and reliable method for obtaining 3D information. However, most of the work has been limited to range sensing of static objects, and range sensing of dynamic (moving or deforming) objects has been investigated recently only by a few researchers. Sinusoidal structured-light is one of the well-known optical methods for 3D measurement. In this paper, we present a novel method for rapid high-resolution range imaging using color sinusoidal pattern. We consider the real-world problem of nonlinearity and color-band crosstalk in the color light projector and color camera, and present methods for accurate recovery of color-phase. For high-resolution ranging, we use high-frequency patterns and describe new unwrapping algorithms for reliable range recovery. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods.

使用结构光的有源距离传感是获得3D信息的最准确和可靠的方法。然而，大多数工作仅限于静态物体的距离感应，近来仅有少数研究人员对动态（移动或变形）物体的距离感应进行了研究。正弦结构光是众所周知的用于3D测量的光学方法之一。在本文中，我们提出了一种新的方法快速高分辨率范围成像使用彩色正弦模式。我们考虑了彩色光投影仪和彩色摄像机中非线性和色带串扰的现实世界问题，并提出了准确恢复色相的方法。对于高分辨率测距，我们使用高频模式并描述新的展开算法，以实现可靠的距离恢复。实验结果证明了我们的方法的有效性。
