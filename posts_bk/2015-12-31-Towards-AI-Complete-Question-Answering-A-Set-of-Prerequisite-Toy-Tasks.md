##### Abstract
One long-term goal of machine learning research is to produce methods that are applicable to reasoning and natural language, in particular building an intelligent dialogue agent. To measure progress towards that goal, we argue for the usefulness of a set of proxy tasks that evaluate reading comprehension via question answering. Our tasks measure understanding in several ways: whether a system is able to answer questions via chaining facts, simple induction, deduction and many more. The tasks are designed to be prerequisites for any system that aims to be capable of conversing with a human. We believe many existing learning systems can currently not solve them, and hence our aim is to classify these tasks into skill sets, so that researchers can identify (and then rectify) the failings of their systems. We also extend and improve the recently introduced Memory Networks model, and show it is able to solve some, but not all, of the tasks.

机器学习研究的一个长期目标是产生适用于推理和自然语言的方法，特别是建立一个智能的对话代理。为了衡量实现这一目标的进展，我们认为，通过问题回答来评估阅读理解的一组代理任务是有用的。我们的任务通过几种方式衡量理解：一个系统是否能够通过链接事实来回答问题，简单的归纳，演绎等等。这些任务被设计成任何旨在能够与人交谈的系统的先决条件。我们相信现有的许多学习系统目前还不能解决这些问题，因此我们的目标是将这些任务归类为技能集，以便研究人员能够识别（然后纠正）其系统的缺陷。我们也扩展和改进了最近推出的Memory Networks模型，并且表明它能够解决一些但不是全部的任务。
