##### Abstract
Due to uncertainty on target's motion, the range cell migration (RCM) and azimuth phase error (APE) of moving targets can't be completely compensated in synthetic aperture radar (SAR) processing. Therefore, moving targets often appear two-dimensional (2-D) defocused in SAR images. In this paper, a 2-D autofocus method for refocusing defocused moving targets in SAR images is presented. The new method only requires a direct estimate of APE, while the residual 2-D phase error ( or RCM) is computed from the estimated APE by exploiting the analytical relationship between the 2-D phase error ( or RCM) and APE. Because the parameter estimation is performed in the reduced-dimension space by exploiting prior knowledge on phase error structure, the proposed approach offers clear advantages in both computational efficiency and estimation accuracy.

由于目标运动的不确定性，运动目标的距离像元偏移（RCM）和方位相位误差（APE）在合成孔径雷达（SAR）处理中不能完全补偿。因此，运动目标往往出现在SAR图像中的二维（2-D）散焦。本文提出了一种二维自聚焦方法，用于SAR图像中散焦运动目标的重聚焦。新方法只需要APE的直接估计，而利用二维相位误差（或RCM）与APE之间的分析关系，通过估计的APE计算残余二维相位误差（或RCM）。由于参数估计是通过利用相位误差结构的先验知识在降维空间中执行的，因此所提出的方法在计算效率和估计准确度方面提供了明显的优势。
