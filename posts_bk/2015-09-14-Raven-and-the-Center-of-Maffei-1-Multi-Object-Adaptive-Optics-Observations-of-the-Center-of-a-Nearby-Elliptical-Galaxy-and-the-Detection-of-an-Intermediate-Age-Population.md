##### Abstract
Near-infrared (NIR) spectra that have an angular resolution of ~ 0.15 arcsec are used to examine the stellar content of the central regions of the nearby elliptical galaxy Maffei 1. The spectra were recorded at the Subaru Telescope, with wavefront distortions corrected by the RAVEN Multi-Object Adaptive Optics science demonstrator. The Ballick-Ramsey C_2 absorption bandhead near 1.76 microns is detected, and models in which 10 - 20% of the light near 1.8 microns originates from stars of spectral type C5 reproduce this feature. Archival NIR and mid-infrared images are also used to probe the structural and photometric properties of the galaxy. Comparisons with models suggest that an intermediate age population dominates the spectral energy distribution between 1 and 5 microns near the galaxy center. This is consistent not only with the presence of C stars, but also with the large HBeta index that has been measured previously for Maffei 1. The J-K color is more-or-less constant within 15 arcsec of the galaxy center, suggesting that the brightest red stars are well-mixed in this area.

具有〜0.15角分辨率的近红外（NIR）光谱用于检查附近的椭圆星系Maffei 1的中心区域的恒星内容。光谱记录在斯巴鲁望远镜上，波前畸变由RAVEN多对象自适应光学科学演示器。检测到接近1.76微米的Ballick-Ramsey C_2吸收带，并且其中接近1.8微米的10％至20％的光源于光谱类型C5的恒星再现该特征的模型。档案近红外和中红外图像也被用来探测星系的结构和光度属性。与模型比较表明，中间年龄人口占据了星系中心附近1至5微米的光谱能量分布。这不仅与C星的出现是一致的，而且与之前测量的Maffei 1的大的HBeta指数也是一致的。JK颜色在星系中心的15弧秒内或多或少恒定，表明最亮红星在这个地区是混合的。
