##### Abstract
Previously, we proposed a physically inspired rule to organize the data points in a sparse yet effective structure, called the in-tree (IT) graph, which is able to capture a wide class of underlying cluster structures in the datasets, especially for the density-based datasets. Although there are some redundant edges or lines between clusters requiring to be removed by computer, this IT graph has a big advantage compared with the k-nearest-neighborhood (k-NN) or the minimal spanning tree (MST) graph, in that the redundant edges in the IT graph are much more distinguishable and thus can be easily determined by several methods previously proposed by us. In this paper, we propose a general framework to re-construct the IT graph, based on an initial neighborhood graph, such as the k-NN or MST, etc, and the corresponding graph distances. For this general framework, our previous way of constructing the IT graph turns out to be a special case of it. This general framework 1) can make the IT graph capture a wider class of underlying cluster structures in the datasets, especially for the manifolds, and 2) should be more effective to cluster the sparse or graph-based datasets.

在此之前，我们提出了一种物理启发式的规则，以一种稀疏而有效的结构来组织数据点，称为树内（IT）图，它能够捕获数据集中的一大类潜在的聚类结构，特别是密度基于数据集。尽管在计算机之间需要删除一些冗余的边或者线，但是这个IT图与k最近邻（k-NN）或者最小生成树（MST）图相比具有很大的优势， IT图中的冗余边更加可区分，因此可以通过我们以前提出的几种方法轻松确定。在本文中，我们提出了一个基于初始邻域图（如k-NN或MST等）以及相应的图距来重构IT图的通用框架。对于这个通用框架，我们以前构建IT图的方式是一个特例。这个通用框架1）可以使IT图捕获数据集中更广泛的底层集群结构，尤其是对于流形，2）应该更有效地聚类稀疏或基于图的数据集。
