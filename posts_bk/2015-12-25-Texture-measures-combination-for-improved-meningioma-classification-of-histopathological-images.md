##### Abstract
Providing an improved technique which can assist pathologists in correctly classifying meningioma tumours with a significant accuracy is our main objective. The proposed technique, which is based on optimum texture measure combination, inspects the separability of the RGB colour channels and selects the channel which best segments the cell nuclei of the histopathological images. The morphological gradient was applied to extract the region of interest for each subtype and for elimination of possible noise (e.g. cracks) which might occur during biopsy preparation. Meningioma texture features are extracted by four different texture measures (two model-based and two statistical-based) and then corresponding features are fused together in different combinations after excluding highly correlated features, and a Bayesian classifier was used for meningioma subtype discrimination. The combined Gaussian Markov random field and run-length matrix texture measures outperformed all other combinations in terms of quantitatively characterising the meningioma tissue, achieving an overall classification accuracy of 92.50%, improving from 83.75% which is the best accuracy achieved if the texture measures are used individually.

提供一种可帮助病理学家正确分类脑膜瘤的准确性的改进技术是我们的主要目标。所提出的基于最佳纹理测量组合的技术检查RGB色彩通道的可分离性，并选择最佳分割组织病理学图像的细胞核的通道。应用形态学梯度来提取每种亚型的感兴趣区域并消除活检准备过程中可能出现的噪音（例如裂纹）。通过四种不同的纹理测量（两种基于模型的和两种基于统计学的）提取脑膜瘤纹理特征，然后排除高度相关的特征，将相应的特征融合到不同的组合中，并使用贝叶斯分类器进行脑膜瘤亚型鉴别。结合高斯马尔可夫随机场和游程长度矩阵纹理测量在定量表征脑膜瘤组织方面的表现优于所有其他组合，总体分类准确率为92.50％，从83.75％提高到质量测量得到的最佳准确度单独使用。
