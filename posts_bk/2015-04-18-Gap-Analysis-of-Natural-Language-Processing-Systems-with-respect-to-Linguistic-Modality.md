##### Abstract
Modality is one of the important components of grammar in linguistics. It lets speaker to express attitude towards, or give assessment or potentiality of state of affairs. It implies different senses and thus has different perceptions as per the context. This paper presents an account showing the gap in the functionality of the current state of art Natural Language Processing (NLP) systems. The contextual nature of linguistic modality is studied. In this paper, the works and logical approaches employed by Natural Language Processing systems dealing with modality are reviewed. It sees human cognition and intelligence as multi-layered approach that can be implemented by intelligent systems for learning. Lastly, current flow of research going on within this field is talked providing futurology.

形式是语言学中语法的重要组成部分之一。让演讲者表达对事态的态度，或给予评估或潜在的事态。它意味着不同的感官，因此根据上下文有不同的看法。本文介绍了一个帐户，显示当前的艺术自然语言处理（NLP）系统功能的差距。研究语言形式的语境性质。在本文中，审查了自然语言处理系统处理模态的工作和逻辑方法。它将人类的认知和智能看作是可以通过智能系统进行学习的多层次方法。最后，目前在这个领域内进行的研究流动是提供未来学。
