##### Abstract
Knowledge graph embedding refers to projecting entities and relations in knowledge graph into continuous vector spaces. State-of-the-art methods, such as TransE, TransH, and TransR build embeddings by treating relation as translation from head entity to tail entity. However, previous models can not deal with reflexive/one-to-many/many-to-one/many-to-many relations properly, or lack of scalability and efficiency. Thus, we propose a novel method, flexible translation, named TransF, to address the above issues. TransF regards relation as translation between head entity vector and tail entity vector with flexible magnitude. To evaluate the proposed model, we conduct link prediction and triple classification on benchmark datasets. Experimental results show that our method remarkably improve the performance compared with several state-of-the-art baselines.

知识图嵌入是指将知识图中的实体和关系投影到连续的向量空间中。诸如TransE，TransH和TransR之类的最先进的方法通过将关系视为从头实体到尾实体的转换来构建嵌入。但是，以前的模型无法正确处理自反/一对多/多对一/多对多的关系，或缺乏可扩展性和效率。因此，我们提出了一种新颖的方法，灵活的翻译，命名为TransF，以解决上述问题。 TransF将头部实体矢量与尾部实体矢量之间的关系视为灵活的量度。为了评估所提出的模型，我们对基准数据集进行链接预测和三重分类。实验结果表明，与一些最新的基线相比，我们的方法显着提高了性能。
