##### Abstract
Studying characters plays a vital role in computationally representing and interpreting narratives. Unlike previous work, which has focused on inferring character roles, we focus on the problem of modeling their relationships. Rather than assuming a fixed relationship for a character pair, we hypothesize that relationships are dynamic and temporally evolve with the progress of the narrative, and formulate the problem of relationship modeling as a structured prediction problem. We propose a semi-supervised framework to learn relationship sequences from fully as well as partially labeled data. We present a Markovian model capable of accumulating historical beliefs about the relationship and status changes. We use a set of rich linguistic and semantically motivated features that incorporate world knowledge to investigate the textual content of narrative. We empirically demonstrate that such a framework outperforms competitive baselines.

学习角色在计算表达和解释叙述方面起着至关重要的作用。与以往着重推测角色角色的工作不同，我们关注的是建模关系的问题。我们假设关系是动态的，随着叙述的进展而暂时演化，并将关系建模问题描述为一个结构化的预测问题，而不是假定一个字符对的固定关系。我们提出了一个半监督框架，以从完全和部分标记的数据学习关系序列。我们提出一个马尔可夫模型，能够积累有关关系和地位变化的历史信念。我们使用一套丰富的语言和语义动机的特征，结合世界知识来调查叙事的文本内容。我们凭经验证明，这样的框架胜过竞争基线。
