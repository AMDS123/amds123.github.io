##### Abstract
Coordinate relation refers to the relation between instances of a concept and the relation between the directly hyponyms of a concept. In this paper, we focus on the task of extracting terms which are coordinate with a user given seed term in Chinese, and grouping the terms which belong to different concepts if the seed term has several meanings. We propose a semi-supervised method that integrates manually defined linguistic patterns and automatically learned semi-structural patterns to extract coordinate terms in Chinese from web search results. In addition, terms are grouped into different concepts based on their co-occurring terms and contexts. We further calculate the saliency scores of extracted terms and rank them accordingly. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method generates results with high quality and wide coverage.

坐标关系是指概念实例与概念直接下位关系之间的关系。在本文中，我们着重于提取与用户给定的中文种子词相匹配的词，如果种子词具有多种含义，则将属于不同概念的词汇分组。我们提出了一种半监督的方法，将手动定义的语言模式和自动学习的半结构模式相结合，从网络搜索结果中提取中文的坐标词。另外，术语根据其共同出现的术语和上下文被分成不同的概念。我们进一步计算提取的术语的显着性分数并相应地排列它们。实验结果表明，我们提出的方法产生的结果质量高，覆盖面广。
