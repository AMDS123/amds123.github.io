##### Abstract
In this paper a new fractal image compression algorithm is proposed in which the time of encoding process is considerably reduced. The algorithm exploits a domain pool reduction approach, along with using innovative predefined values for contrast scaling factor, S, instead of searching it across [0,1]. Only the domain blocks with entropy greater than a threshold are considered as domain pool. As a novel point, it is assumed that in each step of the encoding process, the domain block with small enough distance shall be found only for the range blocks with low activity (equivalently low entropy). This novel point is used to find reasonable estimations of S, and use them in the encoding process as predefined values, mentioned above, the remaining range blocks are split into four new smaller range blocks and the algorithm must be iterated for them, considered as the other step of encoding process. The algorithm has been examined for some of the well-known images and the results have been compared with the state-of-the-art algorithms. The experiments show that our proposed algorithm has considerably lower encoding time than the other where the encoded images are approximately the same in quality.

本文提出了一种新的分形图像压缩算法，其编码过程的时间明显缩短。该算法利用域池缩减方法，并使用创新的预定义值作为对比度缩放因子S，而不是跨越[0,1]进行搜索。只有熵大于阈值的域块被认为是域池。作为一个新颖点，假定在编码过程的每一步中，只有低活动范围块（等熵熵低）才能找到距离足够小的域块。这个新点被用来寻找S的合理估计，并且在编码过程中将它们用作预定义值，如上所述，剩余的范围块被分割成四个新的较小范围块，并且必须对它们进行迭代，被认为是编码过程的其他步骤。已经对一些众所周知的图像检查了该算法，并将结果与​​最先进的算法进行了比较。实验表明，我们提出的算法编码时间比其他编码图像质量大致相同的编码时间要低得多。
