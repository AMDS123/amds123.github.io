##### Abstract
The discrimination and simplicity of features are very important for effective and efficient pedestrian detection. However, most state-of-the-art methods are unable to achieve good tradeoff between accuracy and efficiency. Inspired by some simple inherent attributes of pedestrians (i.e., appearance constancy and shape symmetry), we propose two new types of non-neighboring features (NNF): side-inner difference features (SIDF) and symmetrical similarity features (SSF). SIDF can characterize the difference between the background and pedestrian and the difference between the pedestrian contour and its inner part. SSF can capture the symmetrical similarity of pedestrian shape. However, it's difficult for neighboring features to have such above characterization abilities. Finally, we propose to combine both non-neighboring and neighboring features for pedestrian detection. It's found that non-neighboring features can further decrease the average miss rate by 4.44%. Experimental results on INRIA and Caltech pedestrian datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed method. Compared to the state-of-the-art methods without using CNN, our method achieves the best detection performance on Caltech, outperforming the second best method (i.e., Checkboards) by 1.63%.

特征的区分和简单性对于有效和高效的行人检测非常重要。但是，大多数最先进的方法无法在准确性和效率之间取得良好的折衷。受到行人简单固有属性（即外观恒常性和形状对称性）的启发，我们提出了两种新的非邻近特征（NNF）：侧向内部差异特征（SIDF）和对称相似特征（SSF）。 SIDF可以表征背景与行人之间的差异，以及行人轮廓与其内部之间的差异。 SSF可以捕捉行人形状的对称相似性。然而，相邻特征难以具有上述表征能力。最后，我们建议结合行人检测的非相邻和邻近特征。发现非相邻特征可以进一步降低4.44％的平均失误率。 INRIA和Caltech步行数据集的实验结果证明了所提出方法的有效性和有效性。与不使用CNN的最先进的方法相比，我们的方法在加州理工学院获得了最好的检测性能，比第二好的方法（即Checkboards）提高了1.63％。
