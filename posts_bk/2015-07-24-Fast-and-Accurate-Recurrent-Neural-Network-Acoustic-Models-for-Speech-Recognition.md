##### Abstract
We have recently shown that deep Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) recurrent neural networks (RNNs) outperform feed forward deep neural networks (DNNs) as acoustic models for speech recognition. More recently, we have shown that the performance of sequence trained context dependent (CD) hidden Markov model (HMM) acoustic models using such LSTM RNNs can be equaled by sequence trained phone models initialized with connectionist temporal classification (CTC). In this paper, we present techniques that further improve performance of LSTM RNN acoustic models for large vocabulary speech recognition. We show that frame stacking and reduced frame rate lead to more accurate models and faster decoding. CD phone modeling leads to further improvements. We also present initial results for LSTM RNN models outputting words directly.

最近，我们已经表明，深长时间短期记忆（LSTM）递归神经网络（RNN）胜过前馈深层神经网络（DNN），作为语音识别的声学模型。最近，我们已经证明，使用这种LSTM RNN的序列训练的上下文依赖（CD）隐马尔可夫模型（HMM）声学模型的性能可以通过用连接主义时间分类（CTC）初始化的序列训练的电话模型来实现。在本文中，我们提出了进一步提高LSTM RNN声学模型对于大词汇量语音识别性能的技术。我们展示帧堆叠和降低帧速率导致更准确的模型和更快的解码。 CD电话建模导致进一步的改进。我们还提供了直接输出字的LSTM RNN模型的初始结果。
