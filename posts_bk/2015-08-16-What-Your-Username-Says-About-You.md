##### Abstract
Usernames are ubiquitous on the Internet, and they are often suggestive of user demographics. This work looks at the degree to which gender and language can be inferred from a username alone by making use of unsupervised morphology induction to decompose usernames into sub-units. Experimental results on the two tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed morphological features compared to a character n-gram baseline.

##### Abstract (translated by Google)
用户名在互联网上无处不在，他们往往暗示用户的人口统计。这项工作通过使用无监督的形态感应来将用户名分解成子单元，从而仅从用户名中推断出性别和语言的程度。两个任务的实验结果证明了所提出的形态特征与字符n-gram基线相比的有效性。
