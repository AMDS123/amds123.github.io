##### Abstract
For more than half a century, the Hough transform is ever-expanding for new frontiers. Thousands of research papers and numerous applications have evolved over the decades. Carrying out an all-inclusive survey is hardly possible and enormously space-demanding. What we care about here is emphasizing some of the most crucial milestones of the transform. We describe its variations elaborating on the basic ones such as the line and circle Hough transforms. The high demand for storage and computation time is clarified with different solution approaches. Since most uses of the transform take place on binary images, we have been concerned with the work done directly on gray or color images. The myriad applications of the standard transform and its variations have been classified highlighting the up-to-date and the unconventional ones. Due to its merits such as noise-immunity and expandability, the transform has an excellent history, and a bright future as well.

半个多世纪以来，霍夫（Hough）变换不断向新的领域扩张。数以千计的研究论文和大量的应用已经发展了几十年。进行全面的调查几乎是不可能的，而且空间要求极高。我们在乎的是强调变革的一些最重要的里程碑。我们描述它的变体详细阐述基本的，如线和霍夫变换。存储和计算时间的高要求通过不同的解决方案来阐明。由于变换的大部分用途都发生在二值图像上，因此我们一直关注直接在灰色或彩色图像上完成的工作。标准变换及其变体的大量应用已被分类，突出了最新的和非常规的。由于其抗噪声和可扩展性等优点，转换历史悠久，前景光明。
