##### Abstract
Why do human languages change at some times, and not others? We address this longstanding question from a computational perspective, focusing on the case of sound change. Sound change arises from the pronunciation variability ubiquitous in every speech community, but most such variability does not lead to change. Hence, an adequate model must allow for stability as well as change. Existing theories of sound change tend to emphasize factors at the level of individual learners promoting one outcome or the other, such as channel bias (which favors change) or inductive bias (which favors stability). Here, we consider how the interaction of these biases can lead to both stability and change in a population setting. We find that population structure itself can act as a source of stability, but that both stability and change are possible only when both types of bias are active, suggesting that it is possible to understand why sound change occurs at some times and not others as the population-level result of the interplay between forces promoting each outcome in individual speakers. In addition, if it is assumed that learners learn from two or more teachers, the transition from stability to change is marked by a phase transition, consistent with the abrupt transitions seen in many empirical cases of sound change. The predictions of multiple-teacher models thus match empirical cases of sound change better than the predictions of single-teacher models, underscoring the importance of modeling language change in a population setting.

为什么人类语言在某些时候会改变，而不是其他的？我们从计算角度解决这个长期存在的问题，重点是声音变化的情况。声音的变化来自每个言语社区无处不在的发音变异性，但大多数这种变化性不会导致变化。因此，一个适当的模型必须考虑到稳定性和变化。现有的声音变化理论倾向于强调个体学习者促进一个或另一个结果的因素，如频道偏倚（有利于变化）或归因偏倚（有利于稳定）。在这里，我们考虑这些偏见的相互作用如何导致人口环境的稳定和变化。我们发现人口结构本身可以作为一个稳定的来源，但只有当两种偏见都是积极的时候，稳定和变化才是可能的，这表明有可能理解为什么声音在某些时候发生变化，而不是其他变化个人发言人推动每个结果的力量之间的相互作用的人口水平的结果。另外，如果假设学习者从两位或更多的教师那里学习，从稳定到变化的过渡就是一个相变标志，与许多经验性声音变化的突然转变一致。因此，多教师模型的预测比单一教师模型的预测更符合声音变化的经验案例，这凸显了人口背景下语言变化建模的重要性。
