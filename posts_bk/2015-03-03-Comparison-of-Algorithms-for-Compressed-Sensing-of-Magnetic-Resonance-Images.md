##### Abstract
Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is an essential medical tool with inherently slow data acquisition process. Slow acquisition process requires patient to be long time exposed to scanning apparatus. In recent years significant efforts are made towards the applying Compressive Sensing technique to the acquisition process of MRI and biomedical images. Compressive Sensing is an emerging theory in signal processing. It aims to reduce the amount of acquired data required for successful signal reconstruction. Reducing the amount of acquired image coefficients leads to lower acquisition time, i.e. time of exposition to the MRI apparatus. Using optimization algorithms, satisfactory image quality can be obtained from the small set of acquired samples. A number of optimization algorithms for the reconstruction of the biomedical images is proposed in the literature. In this paper, three commonly used optimization algorithms are compared and results are presented on the several MRI images.

磁共振成像（MRI）是具有固有的慢数据采集过程的基本医疗工具。缓慢的采集过程要求患者长时间接触扫描仪器。近年来，在将压缩感知技术应用于MRI和生物医学图像采集过程方面做出了重大的努力。压缩感知是信号处理中新兴的理论。它旨在减少信号重建所需的采集数据量。减少获取的图像系数的量导致较低的获取时间，即，展示给MRI设备的时间。使用优化算法，可以从一小组获得的样本中获得令人满意的图像质量。文献中提出了许多用于重建生物医学图像的优化算法。本文对三种常用的优化算法进行了比较，并对几种MRI图像进行了结果分析。
