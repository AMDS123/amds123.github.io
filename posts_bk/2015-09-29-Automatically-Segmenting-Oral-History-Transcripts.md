##### Abstract
Dividing oral histories into topically coherent segments can make them more accessible online. People regularly make judgments about where coherent segments can be extracted from oral histories. But making these judgments can be taxing, so automated assistance is potentially attractive to speed the task of extracting segments from open-ended interviews. When different people are asked to extract coherent segments from the same oral histories, they often do not agree about precisely where such segments begin and end. This low agreement makes the evaluation of algorithmic segmenters challenging, but there is reason to believe that for segmenting oral history transcripts, some approaches are more promising than others. The BayesSeg algorithm performs slightly better than TextTiling, while TextTiling does not perform significantly better than a uniform segmentation. BayesSeg might be used to suggest boundaries to someone segmenting oral histories, but this segmentation task needs to be better defined.

##### Abstract (translated by Google)
将口述历史划分为局部连贯的片段可以使其更容易在线访问。人们经常对口述历史中可以提取连贯段的地方做出判断。但是做出这些判断可能是要征税的，所以自动化的帮助对于加快从开放式访谈中提取细分的任务具有潜在的吸引力。当不同的人被要求从相同的口述历史中提取连贯的片段时，他们往往不同意这些片段开始和结束的位置。这一低的一致性使得算法分割器的评估具有挑战性，但是有理由相信，对于分割口述历史成绩单，一些方法比其他方法更有前途。 BayesSeg算法的性能比TextTiling稍好，而TextTiling的性能不如统一分割好。 BayesSeg可能被用来为分割口述历史的人建议边界，​​但是这个分割任务需要被更好地定义。
