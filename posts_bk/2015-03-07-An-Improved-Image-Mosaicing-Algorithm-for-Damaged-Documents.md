##### Abstract
It is a common phenomenon in day to day life; where in some of the document gets damaged. Out of several reasons, the main reason for documents getting damaged is shredding by hands. Recovery of such documents is essential. Manual recovery of such damaged document is tedious and time consuming task. In this paper, we are describing an algorithm which recovers the original document from such shredded pieces of the same. In order to implement this, we are using a simple technique called Image Mosaicing. In this technique a complete new image is developed using two or more torn fragments. For simplicity of implementation, we are considering only two torn pieces of a document that will be mosaiced together. The successful implementation of this algorithm would lead to recovery of important information which in turn would be beneficial in various fields such as forensic sciences, archival study, etc

这是日常生活中常见的现象;在一些文件被损坏的地方。出于几个原因，文件被破坏的主要原因是用手撕碎。恢复这些文件是至关重要的。手动恢复这种损坏的文件是一项繁琐和耗时的工作。在本文中，我们正在描述一种算法，从相同的碎片中恢复原始文档。为了实现这一点，我们正在使用一种称为图像拼接的简单技术。在这个技术中，一个完整的新图像是使用两个或多个撕碎的碎片来开发的。为了简单的实现，我们只考虑将两个碎片拼成一个文件。这种算法的成功实施将导致重要的信息的恢复，而这又将有利于法庭科学，档案研究等各个领域。
