##### Abstract
This paper aims to improve the accuracy of texture classification based on extracting texture features using five different texture methods and classifying the patterns using a naive Bayesian classifier. Three statistical-based and two model-based methods are used to extract texture features from eight different texture images, then their accuracy is ranked after using each method individually and in pairs. The accuracy improved up to 97.01% when model based -Gaussian Markov random field (GMRF) and fractional Brownian motion (fBm) - were used together for classification as compared to the highest achieved using each of the five different methods alone; and proved to be better in classifying as compared to statistical methods. Also, using GMRF with statistical based methods, such as Gray level co-occurrence (GLCM) and run-length (RLM) matrices, improved the overall accuracy to 96.94% and 96.55%; respectively.

本文旨在利用五种不同的纹理方法提取基于纹理特征的纹理分类的准确性，并使用朴素贝叶斯分类器对图案进行分类。采用三种基于统计的和两种基于模型的方法从八种不同的纹理图像中提取纹理特征，然后在分别使用每种方法并成对使用之后对其精度进行排序。当基于模型的高斯马尔可夫随机场（GMRF）和分数布朗运动（fBm）一起用于分类时，与单独使用五种不同方法中的每一种所获得的最高值相比，准确度提高达97.01％与统计方法相比，分类效果更好。此外，使用基于统计学的方法（如灰度共生（GLCM）和游程长度（RLM）矩阵）的GMRF将总体准确度提高到96.94％和96.55％。分别。
