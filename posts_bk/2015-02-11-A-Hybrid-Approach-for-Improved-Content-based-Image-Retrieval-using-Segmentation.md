##### Abstract
The objective of Content-Based Image Retrieval (CBIR) methods is essentially to extract, from large (image) databases, a specified number of images similar in visual and semantic content to a so-called query image. To bridge the semantic gap that exists between the representation of an image by low-level features (namely, colour, shape, texture) and its high-level semantic content as perceived by humans, CBIR systems typically make use of the relevance feedback (RF) mechanism. RF iteratively incorporates user-given inputs regarding the relevance of retrieved images, to improve retrieval efficiency. One approach is to vary the weights of the features dynamically via feature reweighting. In this work, an attempt has been made to improve retrieval accuracy by enhancing a CBIR system based on color features alone, through implicit incorporation of shape information obtained through prior segmentation of the images. Novel schemes for feature reweighting as well as for initialization of the relevant set for improved relevance feedback, have also been proposed for boosting performance of RF- based CBIR. At the same time, new measures for evaluation of retrieval accuracy have been suggested, to overcome the limitations of existing measures in the RF context. Results of extensive experiments have been presented to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed approaches.

基于内容的图像检索（CBIR）方法的目标本质上是从大的（图像）数据库中提取指定数量的在视觉和语义内容上相似的图像到所谓的查询图像。为了弥补由低级特征（即，颜色，形状，纹理）与其人类所感知的高级语义内容之间存在的语义鸿沟，CBIR系统通常利用相关性反馈（RF ）机制。 RF迭代地结合用户给出的关于检索图像的相关性的输入，以提高检索效率。一种方法是通过特征重新调整来动态改变特征的权重。在这项工作中，通过隐式地结合通过事先分割图像获得的形状信息，尝试通过仅基于色彩特征来增强CBIR系统来提高检索准确性。还提出了用于特征重新加权以及用于改进相关性反馈的相关集的初始化的新颖方案，以提高基于RF的CBIR的性能。同时，提出了新的检索准确度评估方法，以克服RF现有措施的局限性。已经提供了大量实验的结果来说明所提出的方法的有效性。
