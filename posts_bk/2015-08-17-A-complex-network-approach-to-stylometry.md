##### Abstract
Statistical methods have been widely employed to study the fundamental properties of language. In recent years, methods from complex and dynamical systems proved useful to create several language models. Despite the large amount of studies devoted to represent texts with physical models, only a limited number of studies have shown how the properties of the underlying physical systems can be employed to improve the performance of natural language processing tasks. In this paper, I address this problem by devising complex networks methods that are able to improve the performance of current statistical methods. Using a fuzzy classification strategy, I show that the topological properties extracted from texts complement the traditional textual description. In several cases, the performance obtained with hybrid approaches outperformed the results obtained when only traditional or networked methods were used. Because the proposed model is generic, the framework devised here could be straightforwardly used to study similar textual applications where the topology plays a pivotal role in the description of the interacting agents.

##### Abstract (translated by Google)
统计方法已被广泛用于研究语言的基本属性。近年来，复杂动力系统的方法被证明可以用来创建几种语言模型。尽管大量的研究致力于用物理模型来表示文本，但是只有有限数量的研究表明如何利用底层物理系统的特性来改善自然语言处理任务的性能。在本文中，我通过设计能够提高当前统计方法性能的复杂网络方法来解决这个问题。使用模糊分类策略，我发现从文本中提取的拓扑属性补充了传统的文本描述。在一些情况下，使用混合方法获得的性能优于仅使用传统或联网方法所获得的结果。由于所提出的模型是通用的，所以这里设计的框架可以直接用于研究相似的文本应用，其中拓扑在描述交互代理的过程中起关键作用。
