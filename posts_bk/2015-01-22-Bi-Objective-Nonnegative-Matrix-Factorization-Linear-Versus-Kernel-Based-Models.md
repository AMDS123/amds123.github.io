##### Abstract
Nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) is a powerful class of feature extraction techniques that has been successfully applied in many fields, namely in signal and image processing. Current NMF techniques have been limited to a single-objective problem in either its linear or nonlinear kernel-based formulation. In this paper, we propose to revisit the NMF as a multi-objective problem, in particular a bi-objective one, where the objective functions defined in both input and feature spaces are taken into account. By taking the advantage of the sum-weighted method from the literature of multi-objective optimization, the proposed bi-objective NMF determines a set of nondominated, Pareto optimal, solutions instead of a single optimal decomposition. Moreover, the corresponding Pareto front is studied and approximated. Experimental results on unmixing real hyperspectral images confirm the efficiency of the proposed bi-objective NMF compared with the state-of-the-art methods.

非负矩阵分解（NMF）是一类强大的特征提取技术，已经在信号和图像处理等许多领域得到了成功应用。目前的NMF技术已经被限制在其线性或非线性基于核的制定中的单目标问题。在本文中，我们建议重新考虑NMF作为一个多目标问题，特别是双目标问题，其中在输入和特征空间中定义的目标函数被考虑在内。通过利用多目标优化文献中的加权和方法，提出的双目标NMF确定了一组非最优解，Pareto最优解，而不是单一的最优分解。此外，相应的帕累托正面被研究和近似。对混合真实高光谱图像的实验结果证实了与最先进的方法相比所提出的双目标NMF的效率。
