##### Abstract
Image processing applications are common in every field of our daily life. However, most of them are very complex and contain several tasks with different complexities which result in varying requirements for computing architectures. Nevertheless, a general processing scheme in every image processing application has a similar structure, called image processing pipeline: (1) capturing an image, (2) pre-processing using local operators, (3) processing with global operators and (4) post-processing using complex operations. Therefore, application-specialized hardware solutions based on heterogeneous architectures are used for image processing. Unfortunately the development of applications for heterogeneous hardware architectures is challenging due to the distribution of computational tasks among processors and programmable logic units. Nowadays, image processing systems are started from scratch which is time-consuming, error-prone and inflexible. A new methodology for modeling and implementing is needed in order to reduce the development time of heterogenous image processing systems. This paper introduces a new holistic top down approach for image processing systems. Two challenges have to be investigated. First, designers ought to be able to model their complete image processing pipeline on an abstract layer using UML. Second, we want to close the gap between the abstract system and the system architecture.

图像处理应用在我们日常生活的每个领域都很常见。然而，其中大部分都非常复杂，包含了几个复杂度不同的任务，这些任务导致了计算体系结构的不同要求。然而，每个图像处理应用中的一般处理方案具有相似的结构，被称为图像处理流水线：（1）捕获图像，（2）使用本地操作员的预处理，（3）与全球运营商的处理和（4）使用复杂的操作进行处理。因此，采用基于异构体系结构的专用硬件解决方案进行图像处理。不幸的是，由于计算任务在处理器和可编程逻辑单元之间的分配，异构硬件体系结构的应用程序的开发具有挑战性。目前，图像处理系统从零开始，费时，易出错，不灵活。为了减少异构图像处理系统的开发时间，需要一种新的建模和实现方法。本文介绍了一种新的整体自上而下的图像处理系统的方法。必须调查两个挑战。首先，设计人员应该能够使用UML在抽象层上对完整的图像处理流水线进行建模。其次，我们想缩小抽象系统与系统架构之间的差距。
