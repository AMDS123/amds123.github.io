##### Abstract
Psychological studies indicate that emotional states are expressed in the way people walk and the human gait is investigated in terms of its ability to reveal a person's emotional state. And Microsoft Kinect is a rapidly developing, inexpensive, portable and no-marker motion capture system. This paper gives a new referable method to do emotion recognition, by using Microsoft Kinect to do gait pattern analysis, which has not been reported. $59$ subjects are recruited in this study and their gait patterns are record by two Kinect cameras. Significant joints selecting, Coordinate system transforming, Slider window gauss filter, Differential operation, and Data segmentation are used in data preprocessing. Feature extracting is based on Fourier transformation. By using the NaiveBayes, RandomForests, libSVM and SMO classification, the recognition rate of natural and unnatural emotions can reach above 70%.It is concluded that using the Kinect system can be a new method in recognition of emotions.

心理学研究表明，情绪状态以人们走路的方式表达，人的步态通过揭示人的情绪状态的能力来表达。微软Kinect是一个快速发展，便宜，便携和无标记的运动捕捉系统。本文采用微软Kinect进行步态模式分析，提出了一种新的可供识别的方法来进行情感识别。在这项研究中招募$ 59 $科目，他们的步态模式是由两个Kinect相机记录。重要的关节选择，坐标系变换，滑动窗口高斯过滤器，差分操作和数据分割用于数据预处理。特征提取基于傅立叶变换。通过使用NaiveBayes，RandomForests，LibSVM和SMO分类，自然和非自然情绪的识别率可以达到70％以上。使用Kinect系统可以作为识别情绪的新方法。
