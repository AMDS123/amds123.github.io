##### Abstract
Digital images are ubiquitous in our modern lives, with uses ranging from social media to news, and even scientific papers. For this reason, it is crucial evaluate how accurate people are when performing the task of identify doctored images. In this paper, we performed an extensive user study evaluating subjects capacity to detect fake images. After observing an image, users have been asked if it had been altered or not. If the user answered the image has been altered, he had to provide evidence in the form of a click on the image. We collected 17,208 individual answers from 383 users, using 177 images selected from public forensic databases. Different from other previously studies, our method propose different ways to avoid lucky guess when evaluating users answers. Our results indicate that people show inaccurate skills at differentiating between altered and non-altered images, with an accuracy of 58%, and only identifying the modified images 46.5% of the time. We also track user features such as age, answering time, confidence, providing deep analysis of how such variables influence on the users' performance.

数字图像在我们的现代生活中无处不在，从社交媒体到新闻，甚至是科学论文的用途。出于这个原因，评估人员在执行识别篡改图像任务时的准确性至关重要。在本文中，我们进行了广泛的用户研究，评估主题检测假图像的能力。在观察图像之后，询问用户是否已经改变了。如果用户回答了图像已被更改，则必须以图像上的点击形式提供证据。我们从383位用户那里收集了17,208个个人答案，使用从公共取证数据库中选择的177个图像。与以前的其他研究不同，我们的方法提出了不同的方法来避免评估用户答案时的幸运猜测。我们的研究结果表明，人们在区分改变和未改变的图像方面显示出不准确的技能，精确度为58％，只有46.5％的时间能识别改变的图像。我们也跟踪用户的特征，如年龄，回答时间，信心，提供深入分析这些变量如何影响用户的表现。
