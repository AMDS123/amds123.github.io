##### Abstract
Many realistic networks are scale-free, with small characteristic path lengths, high clustering, and power law in their degree distribution. They can be obtained by dynamical networks in which a preferential attachment process takes place. However, this mechanism is non-local, in the sense that it requires knowledge of the whole graph in order for the graph to be updated. Instead, if preferential attachment and realistic networks occur in physical systems, these features need to emerge from a local model. In this paper, we propose a local model and show that a possible ingredient (which is often underrated) for obtaining scale-free networks with local rules is memory. Such a model can be realised in solid-state circuits, using non-linear passive elements with memory such as memristors, and thus can be tested experimentally.

许多现实的网络是无标度的，具有小的特征路径长度，高度聚类和幂律分布。他们可以通过动态网络获得优惠的附件过程。然而，这种机制是非局部的，因为它需要知道整个图表才能更新图表。相反，如果物理系统中存在优先依附和现实网络，则这些特征需要从局部模型中出现。在本文中，我们提出了一个局部模型，并且表明用于获得具有本地规则的无标度网络的可能成分（通常被低估）是记忆。这样的模型可以在固态电路中实现，使用具有忆阻器的存储器的非线性无源元件，因此可以通过实验测试。
