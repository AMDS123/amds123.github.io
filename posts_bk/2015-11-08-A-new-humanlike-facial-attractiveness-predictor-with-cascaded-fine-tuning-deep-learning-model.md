##### Abstract
This paper proposes a deep leaning method to address the challenging facial attractiveness prediction problem. The method constructs a convolutional neural network of facial beauty prediction using a new deep cascaded fine-turning scheme with various face inputting channels, such as the original RGB face image, the detail layer image, and the lighting layer image. With a carefully designed CNN model of deep structure, large input size and small convolutional kernels, we have achieved a high prediction correlation of 0.88. This result convinces us that the problem of facial attractiveness prediction can be solved by deep learning approach, and it also shows the important roles of the facial smoothness, lightness, and color information that were involved in facial beauty perception, which is consistent with the result of recent psychology studies. Furthermore, we analyze the high-level features learnt by CNN through visualization of its hidden layers, and some interesting phenomena were observed. It is found that the contours and appearance of facial features, especially eyes and moth, are the most significant facial attributes for facial attractiveness prediction, which is also consistent with the visual perception intuition of human.

本文提出了一种深度学习方法来解决具有挑战性的面部吸引力预测问题。该方法利用原始RGB人脸图像，细节层图像和照明层图像等各种人脸输入通道的深度级联精细化方案，构建了面部美容预测的卷积神经网络。通过精心设计的深层结构，大输入大小和小卷积核的CNN模型，实现了0.88的高预测相关性。这个结果说服了我们，面部吸引力预测问题可以通过深度学习的方法来解决，同时也显示了面部美容知觉所涉及的面部光滑度，亮度和颜色信息的重要作用，与结果一致最近的心理学研究。此外，我们通过对隐藏层的可视化分析CNN学到的高级特征，并观察到一些有趣的现象。发现面部特征（尤其是眼睛和蛾子）的轮廓和外观是面部吸引力预测的最重要的面部特征，这与人类的视觉感知直观性也是一致的。
