##### Abstract
Recently, it was shown that excellent results can be achieved in both face landmark localization and pose-invariant face recognition. These breakthroughs are attributed to the efforts of the community to manually annotate facial images in many different poses and to collect 3D faces data. In this paper, we propose a novel method for joint face landmark localization and frontal face reconstruction (pose correction) using a small set of frontal images only. By observing that the frontal facial image is the one with the minimum rank from all different poses we formulate an appropriate model which is able to jointly recover the facial landmarks as well as the frontalized version of the face. To this end, a suitable optimization problem, involving the minimization of the nuclear norm and the matrix $\ell_1$ norm, is solved. The proposed method is assessed in frontal face reconstruction (pose correction), face landmark localization, and pose-invariant face recognition and verification by conducting experiments on $6$ facial images databases. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

最近，已经表明，在人脸地标定位和姿态不变的人脸识别中都可以获得优异的结果。这些突破是由于社区努力手动注释面部图像在许多不同的姿势，并收集3D面部数据。在本文中，我们提出了一种新的联合人脸地标定位和正面人脸重建（姿态校正）的方法只使用一小幅正面图像。通过观察正面人脸图像是来自不同姿势的最小等级人脸图像，我们制定了一个合适的模型，能够共同恢复面部标志以及人脸的正面版本。为此，解决了一个适当的优化问题，涉及到最小化核范数和矩阵$范数。该方法在正面人脸重建（姿态校正），人脸地标定位和姿态不变人脸识别和验证方面进行了评估，在$ 6 $的人脸图像数据库上进行实验。实验结果证明了该方法的有效性。
