##### Abstract
Binary relation extraction methods have been widely studied in recent years. However, few methods have been developed for higher n-ary relation extraction. One limiting factor is the effort required to generate training data. For binary relations, one only has to provide a few dozen pairs of entities per relation, as training data. For ternary relations (n=3), each training instance is a triplet of entities, placing a greater cognitive load on people. For example, many people know that Google acquired Youtube but not the dollar amount or the date of the acquisition and many people know that Hillary Clinton is married to Bill Clinton by not the location or date of their wedding. This makes higher n-nary training data generation a time consuming exercise in searching the Web. We present a resource for training ternary relation extractors. This was generated using a minimally supervised yet effective approach. We present statistics on the size and the quality of the dataset.

##### Abstract (translated by Google)
二元关系抽取方法近年来得到了广泛的研究。但是，对于更高级的n元关系提取，很少有方法被开发出来。一个限制因素是生成训练数据所需的努力。对于二元关系，每个关系只需要提供几十对实体作为训练数据。对于三元关系（n = 3），每个训练实例都是实体的三元组，对人们产生更大的认知负担。例如，很多人知道谷歌收购了YouTube，而不是收购的金额或收购日期，许多人知道希拉里·克林顿与克林顿已婚，而不是他们婚礼的地点或日期。这使得更高级的训练数据生成在搜索网络上耗费时间。我们提供了一个训练三元关系提取器的资源。这是使用最低限度监督但有效的方法产生的。我们提供数据集的大小和质量的统计数据。
