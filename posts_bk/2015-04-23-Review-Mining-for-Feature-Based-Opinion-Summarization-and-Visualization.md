##### Abstract
The application and usage of opinion mining, especially for business intelligence, product recommendation, targeted marketing etc. have fascinated many research attentions around the globe. Various research efforts attempted to mine opinions from customer reviews at different levels of granularity, including word-, sentence-, and document-level. However, development of a fully automatic opinion mining and sentiment analysis system is still elusive. Though the development of opinion mining and sentiment analysis systems are getting momentum, most of them attempt to perform document-level sentiment analysis, classifying a review document as positive, negative, or neutral. Such document-level opinion mining approaches fail to provide insight about users sentiment on individual features of a product or service. Therefore, it seems to be a great help for both customers and manufacturers, if the reviews could be processed at a finer-grained level and presented in a summarized form through some visual means, highlighting individual features of a product and users sentiment expressed over them. In this paper, the design of a unified opinion mining and sentiment analysis framework is presented at the intersection of both machine learning and natural language processing approaches. Also, design of a novel feature-level review summarization scheme is proposed to visualize mined features, opinions and their polarity values in a comprehendible way.

##### Abstract (translated by Google)
意见挖掘的应用和使用，特别是对于商业智能，产品推荐，有针对性的营销等，已经吸引了全球许多研究者的关注。各种研究工作试图从不同的粒度层面（包括单词，句子和文档层面）挖掘客户评论的意见。然而，全自动意见挖掘和情感分析系统的发展仍然是难以捉摸的。尽管意见挖掘和情感分析系统发展势头迅猛，但大多数企业都试图进行文档级的情感分析，将评论文档分为正面，负面或中性。这种文档级别的意见挖掘方法无法提供关于用户对产品或服务的个别特征的看法。因此，它似乎是为客户和制造商有很大的帮助，如果审查可以在更细致的级别进行处理，并通过一些视觉手段汇总形式呈现，突出表达了他们的产品和用户情绪的个人特点。本文在机器学习和自然语言处理方法的交叉点提出了一个统一的意见挖掘和情感分析框架的设计。此外，还提出了一种新颖的特征级评论摘要方案，以可理解的方式可视化挖掘的特征，意见及其极性值。
