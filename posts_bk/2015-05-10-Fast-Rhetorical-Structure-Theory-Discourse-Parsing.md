##### Abstract
In recent years, There has been a variety of research on discourse parsing, particularly RST discourse parsing. Most of the recent work on RST parsing has focused on implementing new types of features or learning algorithms in order to improve accuracy, with relatively little focus on efficiency, robustness, or practical use. Also, most implementations are not widely available. Here, we describe an RST segmentation and parsing system that adapts models and feature sets from various previous work, as described below. Its accuracy is near state-of-the-art, and it was developed to be fast, robust, and practical. For example, it can process short documents such as news articles or essays in less than a second.

##### Abstract (translated by Google)
近年来，在语篇分析方面进行了大量的研究，特别是RST语篇分析。近期有关RST解析的大部分工作都集中在实现新类型的特征或学习算法，以提高准确性，而对效率，稳健性或实际使用的关注较少。而且，大多数实现不是广泛可用的。在这里，我们描述了一个RST分割和解析系统，它适应了以前各种工作中的模型和特征集，如下所述。它的精度接近最先进的水平，而且它的开发速度很快，强大而且实用。例如，它可以在不到一秒的时间内处理短文件，如新闻文章或散文。
