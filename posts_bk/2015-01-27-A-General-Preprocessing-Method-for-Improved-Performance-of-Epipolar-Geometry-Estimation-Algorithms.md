##### Abstract
In this paper a deterministic preprocessing algorithm is presented, whose output can be given as input to most state-of-the-art epipolar geometry estimation algorithms, improving their results considerably. They are now able to succeed on hard cases for which they failed before. The algorithm consists of three steps, whose scope changes from local to global. In the local step it extracts from a pair of images local features (e.g. SIFT). Similar features from each image are clustered and the clusters are matched yielding a large number of putative matches. In the second step pairs of spatially close features (called 2keypoints) are matched and ranked by a classifier. The 2keypoint matches with the highest ranks are selected. In the global step, from each two 2keypoint matches a fundamental matrix is computed. As quite a few of the matrices are generated from correct matches they are used to rank the putative matches found in the first step. For each match the number of fundamental matrices, for which it approximately satisfies the epipolar constraint, is calculated. This set of matches is combined with the putative matches generated by standard methods and their probabilities to be correct are estimated by a classifier. These are then given as input to state-of-the-art epipolar geometry estimation algorithms such as BEEM, BLOGS and USAC yielding much better results than the original algorithms. This was shown in extensive testing performed on almost 900 image pairs from six publicly available data-sets.

本文提出了一种确定性预处理算法，其输出可作为最先进的极线几何估计算法的输入，从而大大改善其结果。他们现在能够在他们以前失败的艰难案件中取得成功。该算法由三个步骤组成，其范围从局部变为全局。在本地步骤中，它从一对图像中提取局部特征（例如SIFT）。来自每个图像的相似特征被聚类，并且这些聚类被匹配，产生大量假定的匹配。在第二步中，空间上紧密的特征（称为2个关键点）对通过分类器进行匹配和排序。与最高等级的2个关键点匹配被选择。在全局步骤中，从每两个关键点匹配中计算基础矩阵。由于相当多的矩阵是由正确的匹配产生的，所以它们被用来排列在第一步发现的推定匹配。对于每个匹配，计算其基本满足极线约束的基本矩阵的数量。这组匹配与由标准方法生成的假定匹配组合，并且它们的正确概率由分类器估计。然后将这些数据作为输入提供给现有技术的极线几何估计算法，如BEEM，BLOGS和USAC，比原始算法产生更好的结果。这在来自六个公开可用数据集的几乎900个图像对上进行的广泛测试中显示出来。
